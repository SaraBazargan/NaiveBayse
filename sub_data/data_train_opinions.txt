 to the editor being texan i took great interest in of barbecue and men by brent staples the city life july 31 my 10 gallon hat goes off to mr staples for his dedication to the grill but that 's not why i wrote no i 'm afraid i have a much more serious concern mr staples was on the mark until he made the egregious and unfortunately all too common mistake of discussing barbecue sauce barbecue sauce despite its name has no place in barbecue the proof is evident if you have a perfectly grilled piece of meat the addition of sauce can only diminish it now i know this issue is debatable but being texan i do n't really need to justify my beliefs to anyone but my pappy so do not defile your barbecue with so called barbecue sauce your taste buds will thank you and your texan friends will shake your hand with a new enthusiasm ashley williams falls church va july 31 2003
 congress 's main budget adviser has looked years into the future and concluded that the nation can not afford its overheated present as republicans continue cutting taxes enriching spending and rolling ever larger debts a decade over the horizon fiscal autopilot is not an option warned douglas holtz eakin director of the congressional budget office in a no nonsense estimate of serial budget imbalances to come unless the deficit and tax cut happy congress begins to put the brakes on now future americans will most likely be caught in an impossible crunch of historically higher taxes and plummeting health care and retirement benefits mr holtz eakin concluded in his forecast the cost of social security medicare and medicaid inevitably must eat up a sharply increasing chunk of the nation 's economic output as baby boomers retire and people live longer said mr holtz eakin a former bush adviser they will face more expensive health care with fewer active workers to help pay the escalating costs he said with short term economic indicators finally on the rebound no incumbent republican is likely to applaud these warnings they are about problems that will effectively reach a crisis beyond the careers of the very politicians who are most responsible for them but world markets in which the dollar is steadily declining against the euro are already showing a deepening suspicion about president bush 's policy of budgeting by deficit and debt congress should heed mr holtz eakin 's message that moving sooner is better than moving later
 to the editor we should applaud leon botstein 's statement that the federal government has an important part to play in our overly localized system of public education op ed sept 19 but he misses the point that president clinton senator joseph i lieberman and others associated with the democratic leadership council have been trying to make new democrats would argue that a strong federal role can be combined with decentralized administration and local authority there are many ways the federal government can exercise leadership without trying to determine everything that goes on in the schools so let 's try to think anew without being limited by outmoded ideas about government philip selznick berkeley calif sept 19 2000 the writer is professor emeritus of law and sociology at the university of california at berkeley

 to the editor a may 24 letter writer takes umbrage at the simon schuster executive who promoting electronic books referred to a book as a container the writer says the book should be respected as an object of value and beauty in itself the writer might consider the difference between a painting which embodies art and a book which copies it destroy the painting and the art is gone destroy a particular volume and the art is unaffected an identical replacement sits on the shelf at your local bookstore so much is reflected in the conventional usage that a writer sells copies as a book collector i know that copies can be beautifully printed and bound and that one can become attached to these customary physical trappings but confusing the contents with the container risks missing the advantages that a new delivery system might promise true book lovers will appreciate any system that augments their enjoyment of the art and there are situations in which the electronic reader does that dramatically william r andersen seattle may 24 2000
 to the editor paul krugman column feb 27 suggests that market indexes like the dow jones industrial average are irrelevant for long term investors because the successful companies of the future may not even exist yet and are therefore unrepresented in any market index he says if you buy the dow you only buy a claim on the future earnings of the companies currently in the index that 's not a trivial distinction mr krugman is correct if i invest directly in the companies that make up the dow but if i invest using a mutual fund a fund tracking the dow gives me a stake in all the companies in the dow for as long as i hold it hence a long term investor need not speculate on the success of companies unborn he must predict only the index they will appear in andrew g biggs washington feb 28 2000 the writer is an analyst at the cato institute

 as the nation reflects this week on the meaning of the vietnam war 25 years after the fall of saigon a few fateful words of lyndon johnson 's tumble across the decades to remind us that a senseless conflict might have been avoided on a may morning in 1964 as johnson was weighing whether to expand american military involvement in vietnam he confided in a conversation with senator richard russell that he did not really know why washington should go to war in southeast asia referring to sgt kenneth gaddis who was one of his valets johnson said he was troubled by the idea of sending this father of six children to war and what the hell are we going to get out of his doing it johnson asked himself and it just makes the chills run up my back even so many years later it is hard not to be saddened and angered by johnson 's failure to follow that simple impulse his comments recorded by the white house and published a few years ago by michael beschloss in a compendium of johnson tapes entitled taking charge captured a larger truth that still rests uneasily on the american soul no compelling national interest was served by waging war in vietnam and the men who directed the war including johnson and his secretary of defense robert mcnamara knew it at the time more than 58000 american servicemen lost their lives in a land of negligible political and economic importance to the welfare of the united states the idea that communism would advance inexorably across asia if ho chi minh was victorious in vietnam was the hallucination of men numbed and trapped by the liturgies of the cold war the same men also violated a cardinal principle of politics and warfare by drafting citizens for combat without first building strong public support for their cause the gulf of tonkin resolution approved by congress in 1964 after the pentagon reported that united states naval vessels had been attacked by north vietnam was a flimsy license for committing the country to a land war in asia as opposition grew and demonstrations against the fighting spread across the country johnson and his aides failed to recognize that a divided democracy can not sustain a foreign war without doing grievous damage to itself and its principles by the time johnson realized the harm he had done his political career was wrecked and the domestic achievements of his presidency had been overshadowed by his reckless spilling of american and vietnamese blood the physical wounds of those who fought bravely in vietnam healed long ago but the war will always loom large in their lives as it does in the political memory of the nation it changed america in innumerable ways for better and for worse it undermined a generation 's faith in the judgment and truthfulness of its military and diplomatic leaders but above all it taught us that the united states must not commit its soldiers to protracted combat in the absence of clear security interests and that future wars can not be fought without the support of the american people for these and many other reasons the vietnam war memorial in washington is different from the other monuments where america honors its fallen soldiers the starkness and simplicity of the memorial with the names of each soldier etched in polished black granite reminds visitors that no victory is celebrated on this spot no noble cause honored in memory of those who sacrificed their lives the monument instead commemorates the needless sacrifice of troops who were betrayed by a president who prosecuted a war he did not believe in for a goal that he could not define in public speeches or private conversation that more than anything is what the nation must remember this week and that is why the words of lyndon johnson still sting

 to the editor re for democrats economy 's surge poses challenge front page nov 2 perhaps the real challenge to democrats over the economic surge is to find courage to tell it as it is to explain believable ideas for solutions comprehensibly and to convince people who should be voting americans need to hear that surges affecting some measurements of the economy will not bring economic stability especially to the middle class so long as corporations are dropping workers in america and contracting the work abroad we must expect this to continue so long as corporations gain great tax benefits as well as old fashioned profits perhaps the most formidable of the challenges will be to citizens who do n't believe that their vote matters or who suppose it makes no difference who wins the elections that is those who no longer believe that america is a democracy jan guardiano fort myers fla nov 2 2003
 public diplomacy the current and gentler term for international propaganda has lately been the subject of task force reports and articles in foreign policy and foreign affairs and both houses of congress will be considering relevant legislation early in their next session one of the first applications of the new thinking on public diplomacy is state department mini documentaries about the lives of muslim americans currently broadcast as commercials on indonesian television the state department is trying to emphasize american values and their wide applicability as well as the accomplishments of americans i have been doing international broadcasting audience research for 25 years and i am not aware of any persons huddled by their radios to hear about the achievements and values of the united states or any other country people do listen to foreign broadcasts if they are in countries where information is controlled by the government they listen to the stations that best provide a credible substitute for the news they are not getting from their domestic media during most of the postwar years radio moscow was the behemoth of international radio yet its audience was normally a small fraction of that of the major western stations this is because radio moscow transmitted propaganda britain spent much less than the soviet union on international broadcasting and still spends less than the united states but its bbc world service has the largest audience and most prestige of any international radio station this is largely because the bbc world service has with rare exceptions remained independent of british government control the american radio stations voice of america radio free europe radio liberty and radio free asia have generally adhered to their news missions and have earned good reputations among their audiences there is nonetheless a persistent ambiguity to american international broadcasting the bbc is prohibited from broadcasting editorials voa by contrast is officially required to broadcast united states government editorials almost all of the recent reports articles bills and speeches about public diplomacy put international broadcasting in the same basket as public diplomacy public diplomacy however manages information to put the united states and its policies in the best light in my experience this is exactly the type of pro government reporting that audiences seek to escape by tuning to foreign broadcasts american decision makers may wonder why on earth they should provide money to a radio or television station that merely tells the truth for the answer let us consider the arab target audience arabs are largely opposed to american policies toward israel and palestine and to any possible american invasion of iraq no amount of spin will make a dent in the public opinion of the arab world however arabs will listen to a radio station or watch a television channel that provides news that is more comprehensive and reliable than what they get from their domestic media well informed they can make up their own minds about current events they will be grateful to the united states for providing such a service the independent journalism of such an american station would be an example of how democracy works arab audiences will hear debate in congress among pundits and in assembly halls sometimes it will be raucous but that 's part of its attraction they may wish for such open differences of opinion in their own countries sooner or later they will hear a viewpoint perhaps from a member of congress perhaps from an american newspaper editorial that is not so far from their own they will understand that such an opinion may not be the bush administration 's foreign policy but it is american and something that will help them relate to america then audiences in the arab world and elsewhere may understand america a bit more and dislike it a bit less all told it might be enough to make a difference kim andrew elliott is an analyst in the office of research of the united states international broadcasting bureau which includes the voice of america

 accountants are trained to make complicated corporate situations neat and easily comprehensible and that is just what representatives of arthur andersen tried to do at yesterday 's congressional hearings into the destruction of enron documents a panel of employees of the accounting giant testified that the fault for what now appears to be a truly huge document shredding project spread out over months and perhaps involving scores of workers lay entirely with a single man david duncan who has been fired as an andersen auditor dorsey baskin managing director of andersen 's professional standards group declared gravely that mr duncan the engagement partner responsible for the enron account had acted without any consultation with others in the firm or so far as we are aware with legal counsel c e andrews an andersen global managing partner also funneled the blame to mr duncan that is not andersen he said of the document destruction that is not what we encourage our employees to do nancy temple who was in charge of enron litigation for andersen appeared crestfallen that mr duncan had embarked on his document shredding spree without her knowledge i only wish she sighed that someone would have raised the question the only andersen employee who did not pick up the theme was not surprisingly mr duncan himself whose version of events remains unknown since he pleaded the fifth amendment to all the committee 's questions while the andersen team was testifying in the house a senate committee heard arthur levitt the former chairman of the securities and exchange commission repeat his calls for tougher conflict of interest rules for the accounting industry and take a swipe at reform proposals put forth by his successor harvey pitt it was the start of what promises to be a long season of enron hearings it would certainly make life easier for arthur andersen if the world accepted its story the accounting industry version of the lone gunman theory but yesterday no one on the house energy and commerce subcommittee appeared convinced as the lawyer on whose watch the document destruction occurred ms temple had the most explaining to do she was the one who sent an e mail to a top andersen executive in houston on oct 12 telling him to remind the enron team of the firm 's document retention and disposal policy was that a reminder to protect necessary papers or did it amount one congressional inquisitor asked pointedly to a shredding order just as troublesome was the timeline of events as presented by the andersen team ms temple eventually got around to telling mr duncan that all the enron documents had to be preserved but not until nov 9 more than two weeks after the sec began its inquiry into enron why the committee wanted to know did ms temple wait so long andersen insists that it was solely mr duncan 's decision whether or not to destroy documents up until november even though at that point the sec 's investigation of enron was well under way and andersen had retained a large new york law firm to help it defend against possible lawsuits with all those red flags flapping around would andersen still leave the decision about which documents to save and which to destroy entirely to mr duncan an accountant without any input from the firm 's lawyers the committee chairman billy tauzin for one was skeptical enough to warn any accounting firms that might be watching the hearings not to try to make this argument in the future another republican cliff stearns risked stating the obvious when he asked is mr duncan being made a scapegoat here this morning the ancient greeks believed that by beating a human outcast with rods and shouting out with hunger and in with health and wealth they could drive their troubles away if arthur andersen is trying to update the ritual it has gotten off to a bad start

 the success of shows like survivor has many wondering where reality television is headed this question has recently come up with our own program confessions which takes an unfiltered look at convicted murderers and other violent felons reality television actually comes in two forms the first which might be called manufactured reality includes shows like survivor and big brother in which real people as opposed to actors are taped in contrived environments often with hollywood production techniques the second unmanufactured reality allows the camera to record real events and presents them with little editing examples include widely applauded programming like katie couric 's colonoscopy on today as well as controversial programming like dr jack kevorkian 's lethal injection of a patient on 60 minutes court tv whose purpose is to cover the full spectrum of crime and justice issues has been in the business of unmanufactured television since 1991 when it first began providing live courtroom coverage recently however we have been criticized for our new series that plays the taped confessions of convicted murderers and other violent felons the issue is whether this format contributes to the public 's understanding of its criminal justice system or whether the show simply taps an audience that has a prurient interest in violent crimes court tv is judged by its ratings but we also carefully consider the benefits and the context of each show and we believe that it is fair to reveal a part of the criminal justice system the confession that has not been seen to this degree before the show provides insights into the criminal mind and it fuels legitimate debate about issues like capital punishment and the usefulness of confessions yes the confessions of criminals are by their nature unsettling but providing an unfiltered look into this part of the criminal justice system is both logical and appropriate transparency particularly as it applies to our government is an important ingredient of democracy moreover all cases on confessions have been fully adjudicated and are part of the public record they have been provided to us by police departments and prosecutors around the country at the same time we agree that some concerns about the show are legitimate as a result we have decided to air after the show 's premiere an additional half hour discussion of the issues that it raises additionally a web site will provide in depth interpretation and analysis shows like survivor make viewers relatively comfortable because they provide a hollywood produced version of life a show like confessions is more troubling because in fact it provides a true picture of the world in which we live the real world is both good and bad and there is value in seeing both henry schleiff is chairman and chief executive officer of court tv

 talk about mixed signals george w bush 's top economic adviser lawrence lindsey has been warning for some time that the stock market is dangerously overvalued that it 's a bubble that is bound to burst and more likely sooner than later mr lindsey who strongly favors mr bush 's proposed 13 trillion tax cut and argues that it would provide a needed economic stimulus has warned his private clients of a potential stock market tailspin that could lead to a recession he said he sold his own stocks about two years ago so he would be able to sleep at night that 's one signal the other signal came monday when mr bush told the nation that the key to saving social security retirement benefits was to allow working americans to invest a portion of their social security taxes in the very same stock market that mr lindsey at the moment wants no part of deciphering this can get confusing it 's as difficult in its way as picking winners in the market or figuring the odds at the craps table in atlantic city or vegas do you feel lucky what bush is doing is taking a guaranteed system that is indexed to inflation and shifting a portion of those benefits to a non guaranteed non indexed system that 's based on the luck of the stock market said roger hickey co director of the campaign for america 's future a progressive policy organization in washington even if mr bush 's bet is right that over the next several years the stock market will do better than most other investments there will still be many unfortunate wage earners finding themselves at retirement time on the wrong end of this big policy stick the stock market by definition has winners and losers even in the best of times you could have pretty good returns in the market on average said mr hickey but with a large number of individuals doing very poorly you could also have two people working side by side making the same money in a job and then one retires at a time the stock market is flush and the other retires a couple of years later when the stock market is crashing and people are losing their shirts there is however a group of guaranteed winners under mr bush 's plan the movers and shakers at the big brokerage houses who have been funneling many millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of mr bush and other politicians just begging them to steer some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in social security taxes their way everyone who sells stocks or mutual funds stands to benefit from this welfare scheme for the not so idle rich face it the republicans have had it in for social security since its inception the historian william manchester wrote about the gop 's desperate efforts in 1936 to block its creation on radio spots actors hired by the republican national committee revealed in shocked tones that each man would be given a number as though there were any other way to keep track of social security accounts and perpetrated the hoax that people would be fingerprinted when the republicans won control of congress in 1946 party leaders called for the repeal of social security and nearly four decades later governor bush 's fellow texan senator phil gramm could be quoted as follows on the question of eliminating minimum benefits for the elderly they are 80 year olds most people do n't have the luxury of living to be 80 years old so it 's hard for me to feel sorry for them governor bush is trying to be a new kind of republican a new kind of conservative a man who masks his party 's traditionally harsh policies with a winning smile oh he 's a charmer but look closely at what he is saying first we must not change social security for those now retired or nearing retirement let me put this plainly for those on social security or close to receiving it nothing will change government has made a commitment and you have made your plans these promises will be honored so those who are retired or close to being retired are safe the rest of you as far as i can tell should look out

 to the editor charles ogletree op ed aug 18 refers to the striking disparity in the speed of confirmations for female and minority versus white male nominees to the federal courts but as senator orrin hatch the judiciary committee chairman has documented during this congress the percentage of minority and female nominees confirmed by the senate 59 percent and 65 percent respectively is nearly identical to the overall confirmation rate of 64 percent the simple truth is that many republican senators want judges with a legal philosophy different from that held by some of the people whom president clinton has nominated there is nothing surprising or sinister in this roger clegg washington aug 18 2000 the writer is general counsel of the center for equal opportunity
 guess what was on the recent cover of the magazine published by campus crusade for christ a glowing young couple pledging themselves to sexual abstinence until their wedding night nope the cover was about poverty in rural cameroon and it reflected a broad new trend that is beginning to reshape american foreign policy america 's evangelicals have become the newest internationalists the old religious right led by jerry falwell and pat robertson trying to battle satan with school prayers and right to life amendments is on the ropes it is being succeeded by evangelicals who are using their growing clout to skewer china and north korea to support israel to fight sexual trafficking in eastern europe and slavery in sudan and increasingly to battle aids in africa evangelicals are usually regarded by snooty college educated bicoastal elitists not that any read this newspaper as dangerous neanderthals but while the old religious right was destructive when it launched the cultural wars the new internationalists are saving lives in some of the most forgotten parts of the world the american electorate was split right down the middle on these cultural wars and nobody was going to win them said richard cizik washington director of the national association of evangelicals explaining the shift to international issues the new international efforts he says are going gangbusters the evangelical movement encompasses one quarter of americans and is growing quickly one measure of its increasing influence is that a newsstand in the united nations has carried the left behind series of religious novels by tim lahaye these books which have sold 50 million copies so far describe the battles that precede the second coming and there is indeed a united nations connection in the novels the antichrist is the secretary general evangelicals have their quirks while many have been galvanized by 9 11 and the middle east conflict and are fervent supporters of israel the recent upheaval in israel has also quickened evangelical interest for more apocalyptic reasons as dwight gibson director of the secretariat of the world evangelical alliance notes the violence has people thinking 'is christ coming back and i have my doubts about the middle east peace plan proffered by the rev franklin graham billy 's son muslims and jews alike should try surrendering their lives to the lord jesus christ and having their hearts changed by the holy spirit yet the evangelicals have won important legislative victories they were behind the international religious freedom act of 1998 fighting religious persecution and the trafficking victims protection act of 2000 battling sex slavery and peonage both passed over objections of the clinton administration they are behind the bush administration 's freezing of money for the united nations population fund i disagree with evangelicals on many issues a simple minded moralistic streak often leads them toward sanctions that would hurt precisely the people they aim to help in sudan myanmar north korea and china the freeze on population funds is a catastrophe for poor women and children yet all in all we should welcome this new constituency for foreign affairs in middle america just look at aids funding with bleeding heart evangelicals like mr graham pressing hard congressional republicans are suddenly scrambling to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars in additional money to fight aids in africa even jesse helms is joining in and that 's pretty much proof of divine intervention evangelicals are among the most generous donors for many tithe evangelical cheapskates donate their 10 percent of incomes after tax the 15 biggest christian charities monitored by ministrywatch com collect more than 3 billion a year even small evangelical funds are booming world relief with 9000 employees says its 40 million budget has doubled in four years i 've lost my cynicism about evangelical groups partly because i 've seen them at work abroad earlier this year for example i visited the philippine island of basilan home base of the abu sayyaf rebel group aid groups have mostly pulled out because of killings and kidnappings but i found one still busy providing food and medicine even in the most dangerous areas it 's the christian children 's fund e mail nicholas nytimescom
 to the editor re a weakened irs editorial april 16 the curbs and budget cuts imposed by congress on the internal revenue service were a response to an abusive agency that was hated by most of the public today the irs is a pleasure to deal with agents are polite and try to be helpful it is a welcome change if too many audits of the lower income groups still go on then action should be taken to reduce the number of those audits more important our system of income taxation has perhaps outlived its usefulness it remains too complicated and expensive to comply with a value added tax or similar system with proper protection for lower income groups may be more in line with the nature of our economy today and would do more to curb tax cheats than going back to the old days of expensive and abusive audits bruce neuman bridgehampton ny april 16 2000

 by the ordinary logic of politics the vice president of an administration that has given us the greatest prosperity in history should be way ahead in this election that he is not is a tribute to the campaigning skill of george w bush no one can doubt any longer that mr bush is a formidable candidate one key to his success became clear in the three debates with al gore all politicians bob and weave around issues that are difficult for them governor bush is a master of the technique when they were debating a patients bill of rights for example and governor bush was asked the difference between the candidates he answered well the difference is that i can get it done that ducked the real issue of what the it was what such legislation should include and obscured the fact that he did not support the meaningful bill pending in congress he repeatedly argued that he could make things happen by putting partisanship aside saying that the clinton administration had had eight years and not achieved a patients bill of rights and other things with that rhetorical device he blanked out the rabid republican partisanship that has made congress a graveyard of legislation and judicial nominations over recent years asked whether he would support a law barring job discrimination against gays and lesbians governor bush replied i do n't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation that is no doubt true admirable and irrelevant to the question of legislation as to that he said gays and lesbians should not have special rights code words used by those who oppose equal rights legislation his reason for avoiding questions of that kind is plain governor bush 's slogan is that he is a compassionate conservative so he does not want to look unsympathetic to people who face discrimination or who are treated unfairly by medical insurance companies but he also does not want to offend the christian right or the insurance companies another facet of governor bush became evident in the debates once he has taken a position designed to fend off criticism he sticks to it no matter how thoroughly it has been exploded long before the debates he sought to stake out a distinct position on foreign and security policy by saying that the us had troops in too many places around the world i believe we 're overextended in too many places he said in the first debate in the second debate asked from which missions he would withdraw the only thing he came up with was that we should convince our european friends to put troops on the ground in the balkans he was apparently unaware that the europeans already have troops there more than we do there are about 10000 americans in a total of 66000 peacekeepers in the third debate he said again i 'm concerned that we 're over deployed around the world undaunted by the facts the reality that he would not bring home our large forces in japan korea or the nato countries he stuck with a line that he thought sounded good another example of that dogged avoidance of reality is capital punishment in the second debate he answered a question about hate crimes by saying with seeming pleasure that three texas killers of a black man were going to be put to death actually only two had been sentenced to death a questioner in the third debate said governor bush seemed to overly enjoy the fact that texas led the nation in executions mr bush said his job in the execution process was to ask two questions sir is the person guilty of the crime and did the person have full access to the courts of law and i can tell you looking at you right now in all cases those questions were answered in the affirmative that is the position that governor bush has consistently taken it just happens to be untrue the way texas provides lawyers for capital defendants is notoriously unfair people have been convicted and sentenced to death after trials in which their lawyers were drunk or asleep and the courts of texas have found no error in that outrage when faced in the debates with particular facts about problems like social security or taxes governor bush scorned them as washington fuzzy math but he is the master of fuzzy rhetoric
 to the editor your july 6 news article describing the apology issued by the hartford courant for publishing advertisements for slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries was interesting but ultimately perplexing and perhaps indicative of our current culture what it comes down to is an issue of moral responsibility but whose responsibility obviously the newspaper as an institution can make up for the errors of its predecessors by promoting freedom and equal rights but how can someone in the year 2000 apologize for the sins of another person how does anything said today absolve the actions of someone 200 years ago dave shaw grand rapids mich july 6 2000

 when the european commission indicated it was likely to block the proposed merger between general electric and honeywell american politicians from george w bush on down cried foul with some alleging that the decision was politically motivated they 're almost certainly wrong about that but it is true that the ec 's case against the merger is far from watertight mario monti europe 's competition referee may have made a bad call on this play nonetheless our politicians should lower their voices mr monti is one of the good guys in today 's global economy he should not be made the target of attempts at political intimidation to put the ge honeywell affair in context you need to realize that this case is a triple switcheroo it contradicts not one but three pieces of conventional wisdom first the conventional view is that globalization weakens governments because it forces them to compete for private investment broadly speaking this view is right conventional wisdom usually is there are however exceptions to the rule and antitrust policy is one of those exceptions in today 's world no company can compete effectively unless it can operate freely on both sides of the atlantic which it can do only with a green light from antitrust authorities in both the united states and europe the result is that instead of eroding the power of those authorities globalization has extended their reach american regulators can block european mergers and vice versa second this case inverts traditional roles until recently only the us seemed to take antitrust policy seriously europeans might have us style legislation on the books but they often seemed to feel that cartels like extramarital affairs were nothing to worry about as long as the participants were discreet and they were scornful toward puritanical americans who insisted on enforcing the letter of the law lately however europe has gotten serious about antitrust giving the competition commissioner broad powers to block mergers and investigate allegations of anticompetitive behavior mr monti an american trained university professor who assumed that office in 1999 has used those powers aggressively general electric and honeywell are by no means the first companies to find mr monti blocking what they thought was a done deal was mr monti right to block this particular deal it 's a complicated issue let 's just say that the case against this merger is similar to the case for breaking up microsoft though it seems a lot weaker on the other hand you do n't need as strong an argument to block a merger as you do to break up a going concern we 're in a gray area with the precise shade of gray a matter of opinion even if you disagree with mr monti 's opinion however his sincerity is not in doubt the best answer to those who claim that this is really a protectionist ploy is mr monti 's track record he has repeatedly shown himself willing to oppose the demands of powerful european interest groups why would he suddenly become a tool of protectionists and that leads us to the third switcheroo europeans are accustomed to cozy cohabitation between politicians and businessmen americans tend to insist on at least the appearance of an arms length relationship but just at the moment when the europeans have placed competition policy in the hands of a sternly upright professor the united states has acquired an administration that seems oblivious to normal concerns about conflict of interest it 's not yet clear whether the bush administration really is a government of by and for big corporations to an extent not seen since warren g harding was president or whether it just looks that way but the stories keep accumulating intel 's chief lobbyist says that his highly inappropriate meetings with karl rove were quite useful to its merger case and mr rove did n't even get a slap on the wrist according to the outgoing chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission the head of enron offered to support him at the white house if he changed his policy positions and it took three months and a sharp prod from jake tapper at salon before treasury secretary paul o'neill honored his promise to sell his alcoa stock as a consumer i 'm not sure i trust these people to protect me from the market power of giant corporations and so it 's nice to know that mr monti is out there looking after my interests

 to the editor as a former director of the fulbright program in greece i congratulate you on why they do n't know us week in review nov 11 about america 's declining interest in cultural diplomacy the article outlined the demise of libraries overseas the stagnant budget for fulbright programs and the dearth of money for programs to project america 's values and ideas while the article focused on the middle east similar dire predictions could be applied to every area in the world a steady focus on public diplomacy is badly needed in the current climate of hate and demonization i remember senator j william fulbright once saying that the cost of one supersonic airplane would fund the fulbright program at the level that is needed how paradoxical that the airplane would be the example chosen to illustrate the need to upgrade america 's premier educational exchange program and to reinstitute a public diplomacy program for the civil society that we all yearn for william r ammerman princeton nj nov 14 2001

 after a summer of record delays and frayed nerves the nation 's flying public is being told the situation is untenable and will be fixed it is a tale we have heard before as recently as a year ago flight delays are up 10 percent from last year this week transportation secretary rodney slater called in the key players in commercial aviation to talk about ways to improve what is increasingly looking like a broken system there are some heartening signs that airlines their unions and transportation regulators are genuinely ashamed of the endurance test flying has become some airlines have agreed to fly some of their short routes at lower altitudes to alleviate congestion in the skies and are cutting back on their schedules to enhance their performance in recent years unrealistic peak time scheduling by airlines at major airports has contributed greatly to delays but there are no quick fixes for a system strained to its limits by the estimated 178 million passengers who will have boarded an aircraft this summer in the united states that figure is up 37 percent from 1990 clearly the longest economic expansion in american history is as responsible for the clogged skies as any other culprit and thanks to the revolution in information technology airlines have become increasingly sophisticated at auctioning off seats to leisure travelers that would otherwise go empty planes are thus more packed than ever making travel all the less enjoyable real systemic relief for the nation 's strained aviation grid is still a few years away in the form of added runways at the busiest airports and a new satellite navigation system that will free pilots from having to stay within set flight lanes in the sky the federal aviation administration has already become a more savvy and efficient traffic cop though one bedeviled all summer by unusually bad weather this june saw 19 severe weather days compared with 5 in 1999 that helped make it the worst flying month ever with more than 50000 delayed flights or 205 percent more than a year earlier because of the hub and spoke architecture of today 's airline route systems when things go badly in one part of the nation 's air grid it tends to affect traffic elsewhere united airlines labor travails this summer did not help matters either pilots at united the nation 's largest airline turned down overtime and called in sick because of a continuing labor dispute forcing the airline to cancel as many as 600 flights over a recent weekend secretary slater has set up a task force to look at ways to enhance the notoriously sloppy quality of information shared by airlines regulators and consumers this is no small matter as anyone stuck at an airport and deprived of meaningful information will agree too often passengers are treated like children incapable of handling the truth or airlines massage facts to shift blame for delays if nothing else a passenger trapped in a hub and spoke nightmare is entitled to accurate information

 will tonight 's state of the union address restore george w bush 's political fortunes only a few weeks ago that would have seemed an extremely unlikely question fresh off the republican victory in the midterm elections president bush seemed invincible and it 's amazing how many stories you still read about his immense unshakeable popularity but anyone who takes the trouble to look at the numbers knows that the thrill is gone mr bush 's approval ratings have plunged over the last two months a year ago he was indeed immensely popular right now he 's not significantly more popular than he was before sept 11 other polls suggest that the public is particularly disenchanted with mr bush 's economic policy most voters no longer believe that his tax cuts are effective at creating jobs and many also believe that his policies favor the wealthy and large corporations rather than people like themselves class warfare still polls can shift as they did suddenly after sept 11 can tonight 's speech do the trick we can be sure that some pundits will acclaim the speech as bold and brilliant they would do that if he read from the very hungry caterpillar whether their praise and the theatrics of the occasion will turn things around is anyone 's guess a lot depends on whether mr bush is held accountable for the promises he made in his last state of the union address for there was more to that speech than the axis of evil a phrase by the way that has vanished from mr bush 's vocabulary along with the name of that guy he promised to bring in dead or alive he assured those who worried about red ink that our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short lived he offered comfort for those who remembered his father 's jobless recovery which felt like a continuing recession when america works america prospers so my economic security plan can be summed up in one word jobs fast forward a year we now know that the small budget deficit will rise above 300 billion and stay there even the administration 's own ever optimistic budget officials now concede that we face deficits as far as the eye can see meanwhile payrolls continue to decline since the working age population keeps rising it 's becoming ever harder for ordinary americans to get jobs or keep them and there 's a good chance things will get a lot worse with markets sliding consumers wilting businesses fearful about the effects of war and oil prices rising the pieces are in place for a full blown double dip recession and the second dip would take us much further down than the first so can mr bush convince us that his latest tax cut is just the tonic the economy needs there are several reasons to doubt whether he can pull it off for one thing economists outside the administration even those who always find ways to praise whatever he proposes ca n't see what this tax cut has to do with the economy 's immediate problems this has led to a striking dissonance between what administration officials say on tv where it 's still all about jobs and what they say when speaking to knowledgeable audiences in background briefings for reporters at the davos conference this past weekend and wherever else they encounter people who might actually know something about the numbers officials now pooh pooh concerns about the state of the job market never mind that they say our plan is all about increasing long run growth um but what about economic security the administration 's credibility problem is made worse by the high casualty rate among top economic officials and the uninspiring quality of their replacements today is the first day of hearings for john snow the administration 's choice for treasury secretary one official i spoke to was rueful i thought paul o'neill was n't suited to being treasury secretary he 'd have been better off running a railroad now they 've picked a man who ran a railroad but that 's not why he was chosen according to cbs market watch he was picked because he 's a lobbyist a schmoozer a master salesman and a member of no fewer than nine country clubs still nobody razzle dazzles 'em like mr bush tonight we 'll see if he 's good enough to make us forget last year 's promises e mail krugman nytimescom
 the economic expansion that began in 1991 will soon become the longest in our history yet last week americans may have been distracted by two reports reminding them of a widening gap between the rich and poor the center on budget and policy priorities and the economic policy institute two liberal research groups put out a state by state breakdown of census bureau data which found nine states led by new york in which the richest 20 percent of households now earn at least 11 times the income of the poorest 20 percent this indicated a much sharper disparity between the top and bottom than existed two decades ago then the federal reserve bank released its latest survey of consumer finances it showed that the average net worth of families earning less than 10000 a year had fallen by 6600 over the past three years while households earning more than 100000 a year had seen their wealth jump by more than 300000 our response is so what few of us should be surprised or threatened by statistics on inequality some americans believe the more equality the better but the fact is that the distribution of income and wealth is n't arbitrary it emerges from broad trends in the economy and is a byproduct of a decade that created 17 million jobs and added 20 percent to median household net worth the unstated implication of the state by state report was that the states where income disparities are lower are somehow fairer than the states with high disparities but the truth is that among communities states and regions income and wealth will vary for many reasons several of them unavoidable and laudable consider for example that income varies with education according to census data high school dropouts in the work force earn an average of 26207 while workers with a professional degree average 127499 census figures show that many of the states with the widest income gaps have greater diversity in education levels than states with smaller income gaps twenty six percent of those over the age of 24 in new york the state with the greatest income disparity have at least a bachelor 's degree whereas in indiana which was among the seven states with the lowest income disparity only 16 percent do should we be lamenting that so many new yorkers went to college another non nefarious cause of increasing income disparity may be our ever higher immigration rates immigrants tend to cluster in low  and high income groups thus it is no surprise that in the seven most unequal states new york arizona new mexico louisiana california rhode island and texas about 13 percent of the population is foreign born in california it 's 25 percent among the seven states with the smallest income disparities the immigrant population is only 38 percent the shift away from manufacturing is also a factor service workers span the gamut from hotel maids to brain surgeons while the pay range is generally narrower in the manufacturing sector states that are industrial tend to have more equal distributions of income data from the bureau of labor statistics show that about 10 percent of workers in arizona louisiana and new york have manufacturing jobs whereas in more equal states like indiana and wisconsin the figure is 23 percent also in the seven states with the greatest income inequality more than 80 percent of the population lives in or near metropolitan areas in states with the most equality only about half does if we were to turn back the clock 100 years and again become a largely rural nation we might not see such large income disparities but that 's because america 's cities are our engines of wealth and offer greater prospects for those who succeed and what of the poorest americans loss of ground compared to the richest as reported by the fed the apostles of equality consider the rising inequality kindling for social unrest but while that would be true if most workers on the bottom rungs were trapped there for generations america is n't a caste society and studies that track individuals incomes over time show that americans have a remarkable ability to propel themselves upward a 17 year study of lifetime earnings by the federal reserve bank of dallas found that only 5 percent of people in the economy 's lowest 20 percent failed to move to a higher income group in a similar study by the treasury department covering 1979 to 1988 86 percent of americans in the bottom fifth of income earners improved their status inequality is not inequity artificial efforts to try to curb wealth gaps invariably do more harm than good heavier taxation might narrow the division between rich and poor but it would be a hollow triumph if it stifled the economy what americans ought to care most about is maintaining our growth not the red herring of gaps in income and wealth w michael cox chief economist of the federal reserve bank of dallas and richard alm are co authors of myths of rich and poor

 the violent crime rate in the united states has fallen by about a third since 1993 but it could fall further if we took better control of the millions of criminals who are on probation rather than in prison or jail a growing body of evidence is showing that the broken windows strategy used effectively by police departments taking petty crimes seriously as a way to establish a low tolerance for lawbreaking at every level can be adapted to the treatment of people on probation if those who break the conditions of probation even with what seem like minor lapses are held accountable for it the public will be safer although our jails and prisons hold nearly two million people there are many more on probation and not just for misdemeanors marring otherwise clean records the bureau of justice statistics reports that in 1999 more than 37 million adults were under supervision of probation officers nationwide nearly two million of them had been convicted of one or more felony crimes but sentenced to probation for those crimes rather than to prison in many states about half the people on probation have histories of criminal violence probation is supposed to rehabilitate the offender and protect the public but about 40 percent of all felony probationers are rearrested for fresh felonies within three years of being placed under community supervision others walk away in 1990 with a probation population a third smaller than what we have now probation agencies had lost track of a quarter million absconders people still under sentence but not reporting in because record keeping has become so spotty no one knows how many absconders there are today few attempts are made to locate them or bring them to court half of all probationers violate the terms of their sentences but only a fifth go to jail as a result in 1998 some 255000 probationers were incarcerated for new felony crimes committed while under supervision and another 615000 violated one or more terms of their sentences but received no punishment and though courts routinely make drug treatment a condition of probation since an estimated 80 percent of probationers have serious substance abuse problems fewer than 40 percent of all probationers nationwide actually participate in drug treatment during their sentences we spend only about 200 a year per probationer and we get what we pay for strapped for time and overburdened by their caseloads probation officers too often resort to fortress probation shuffling paperwork and rarely leaving their offices or having face to face contact with the offenders they supposedly supervise one recent study found that in 1998 fewer than one in 20 people who worked for probation agencies ever actually spent time supervising felony probationers on the streets a lax attitude toward enforcement pervades the system and probationers have come to expect two or more free ones when it comes to drugs in urine samples electronic monitoring violations or failure to comply with a wide variety of conditions the manhattan institute recently released a report by the reinventing probation council a group of probation officials from across the country which argues that the response to violations should be graduated sanctions like curfews or house arrest more intensive supervision or monitoring mandatory drug treatment a brief period of confinement in jail or placement in a close watch residential facility as the report stresses firsthand knowledge of an offender 's family and neighborhood are critical elements of effective supervision probation supervision must cease to be a 9 to 5 occupation it must be delivered at nights on weekends and on holidays such reforms will not be easy adult probation caseloads have soared to more than 500 per officer in many cities some 60 percent of los angeles probationers for example are tracked solely by computer many probation agencies monitoring both adult and juvenile offenders lack even basic data like addresses and phone numbers where strict probation has been tried however the results are encouraging after williamson county tex probation officers decided to crack down on absconders they arrested over 1000 probation violators and collected more than 65000 in unpaid penalties in boston where probation officers formed partnerships with police and clergy to reduce juvenile violence more probationers than ever got face to face visits drug treatment family counseling and help finding jobs during the first year of the effort the number of people arrested for violating probation quadrupled shortly afterward the city went for more than two years without a single gun related juvenile homicide in philadelphia officials discovered that a quarter of the murders in the city 's most violent police district were committed by felons on probation police prosecutors clergy and outreach workers pooled information about young probationers in this district identified as being at extreme risk of killing or being killed the police carefully monitored the group and community leaders offered counseling a year later while youth violence remained high elsewhere in the city the homicide rate had plummeted in the district and none of the targeted young people had lost their lives or taken those of others after the public learned that a suspect in the murders of five people at a wendy 's restaurant in flushing queens last may had previously been convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to probation there were calls to abolish probation but that would be a profoundly unwise and unworkable response tantamount to doubling the prison population overnight we would do better to give probation departments across the country the administrative tools and financial support they need

 the right wingers who were beginning to feel like wallflowers at george w bush 's cabinet dance can stop complaining mr bush who made his earlier selections from his party 's ideological center threw a big bouquet to the ultraconservatives yesterday when he chose john ashcroft the recently deposed republican senator from missouri for the post of attorney general the nomination later in the day of christie whitman the moderate republican governor of new jersey to run the environmental protection agency tilted the overall composition of mr bush 's early choices back toward the center but that could not mute the widespread dismay over mr bush 's troubling choice of mr ashcroft mr bush is clearly hoping that mr ashcroft 's old colleagues will extend him the usual senatorial courtesies and confirm him with little dissent but mr ashcroft 's hard line ideology and extreme views and actions on issues like abortion and civil rights require a searching examination at his confirmation hearing he should not be given an automatic pass the senate is duty bound to determine whether he will be able to surmount his cramped social agenda to act as the guardian of the nation 's constitutional values the attorney general has great discretion in deciding how much energy to devote to protecting civil rights broadening civil liberties keeping society free of crime enforcing the antitrust laws and making sure that the president and his cabinet members are held to the same high standards an area in which the job 's present occupant janet reno has been deficient more than any other cabinet officer the attorney general sets the moral tone of an administration the position should clearly be filled with someone with a reputation for balance fairness and independence mr ashcroft is by all accounts honest and hard working yet he is also judging by the public record a man of cramped vision unyielding attitudes and limited tolerance for those who disagree with him his actions on racial matters alone are enough to give one pause as missouri 's attorney general he opposed even a voluntary school desegregation plan in metropolitan st louis he also conducted a mean spirited and dishonest campaign against ronnie white missouri 's first black state supreme court justice when justice white was nominated for a federal judgeship mr ashcroft claimed erroneously that justice white was soft on the death penalty as an added insult mr ashcroft also accepted an honorary degree last year from bob jones university a bastion of the christian right with a history of racial discrimination mr ashcroft has been one of the senate 's most adamant opponents of a woman 's right to choose an abortion during his political career in missouri he sought to criminalize abortion and he has consistently supported an extreme constitutional amendment that would ban abortion even in the case of rape or incest mr ashcroft has a poor record on church state issues and on gay rights and a dismal record on the environment there is thus reason to wonder how vigorously he will help mrs whitman enforce environmental laws with mrs whitman mr bush has offered a far more appealing nominee for high office his pledge to elevate the epa post to cabinet level is also commendable the epa is no less important than the interior department in providing responsible stewardship of the nation 's natural resources on the plus side mrs whitman seems genuine in caring about the environment and as a northeasterner she is intimately familiar with the problems of polluted air and water she joined with gov george pataki of new york in lawsuits aimed at curbing the pollution that drifts eastward from midwestern power plants and she has worked to protect the new jersey coastline by investing in sewage treatment and storm drainage projects although land conservation is mainly interior 's responsibility mrs whitman demonstrated a real appreciation for the importance of saving natural resources for future generations when she sponsored a 1 billion open space program the largest in new jersey 's history on the minus side she slashed the budget for environmental law enforcement and stopped levying meaningful fines against big polluters that pro business mind set will be disastrous if continued in her new job as will her oft repeated but naive faith in voluntary compliance with environmental laws as mrs whitman will discover there will be times when negotiating skills simply do n't suffice she must be willing to enforce the law in the face of relentless pressure not only from the big interest groups but from her superiors in the white house

 one hears lots of talk these days about the need to change the culture habits and attitudes of the national aeronautics and space administration to head off any repeat of the disaster that destroyed the space shuttle columbia the urgency of that task becomes inescapably clear when one ponders the trials of rodney rocha an obscure engineer who tried repeatedly and in vain to warn shuttle managers of a potential catastrophe only to be rebuffed and ultimately pounded into acquiescing with the prevailing view that all was well as recounted by james glanz and john schwartz on friday in the times some 30 space engineers became concerned about columbia 's safety after watching films that showed a piece of foam break away during liftoff and strike the left wing at a spot that could not be seen the engineers chose mr rocha known for his precision and integrity to convey their belief to shuttle managers that nasa should immediately request images of the impact area from spy satellites or telescopes on the ground at least half a dozen times mr rocha prodded the shuttle managers to take a look each time he got nowhere or earned a sharp rejection one manager called the need for more images a dead issue another said he refused to be a chicken little by raising alarms leading mr rocha to complain that nasa was acting more like an ostrich with its head in the sand faced with such resistance mr rocha lost steam he shrank from sending an e mail note accusing shuttle managers of borderline irresponsibility and accepted a boeing analysis later shown to be fatally flawed that the foam strike posed no risk to the shuttle to make sure that this sorry chain of events does not recur nasa has reached agreements with outside agencies to take images during every shuttle flight and is seeking ways to encourage or even insist upon the presentation of dissenting viewpoints whether this will profoundly change the mind set at nasa is uncertain virtually all analysts agree that reforming the culture of a large agency is far harder than fixing some flaws in its technology
 when vice president al gore chose senator joseph lieberman as his running mate even many jews wondered how an orthodox jew would reconcile his religious obligations with the demands of the job he was seeking would mr lieberman take an official phone call on the sabbath would he fly to washington for a tie breaking vote in the senate the senator explained in response that talmudic scholars had advised him that certain work by public servants on the sabbath was permissible but such rulings tell a fascinating story suggesting that mr lieberman 's candidacy already hailed as a historic event in the history of american jewry could also serve as an important moment in jewish religious law that history is worth thinking about in this season of the jewish new year beginning tonight and in an era of internal divisions for jews in the united states and israel sabbath observance is broadly respected among jews not simply the orthodox the blanket biblical prohibition against working on the sabbath has always allowed certain exceptions for example when a life is at stake still another exception applied historically to a personage known as the shtadlan the name for the jewish representative in old european courts the court jew because the shtadlan pleaded for the safety of jews his working on the sabbath was deemed necessary just as the talmudic doctrine known as pikuah nefesh commands a doctor to work to save a life but of course mr lieberman is not a court jew representing the interests of jews a concept that became abused and discredited anyway he is an observant jew serving a largely secular and non jewish constituency something that official jewish law has dealt with only informally rabbi norman lamm president of yeshiva university the leading orthodox seminary in the united states said that the court jew precedent was irrelevant but that a jewish requirement to respect what is known as tsorkhei rabbim the needs of the larger community could apply to mr lieberman if he does not take a call from russia 's president vladimir putin on shabbas the sabbath he may be jeopardizing an american interest said dr lamm but he added that if elected mr lieberman will have to decide these things ad hoc but under general guidelines of jewish law such fine distinctions are central to jewish law life and identity it will be interesting to see if rabbis and scholars agree that a larger american interest should become a factor in their interpretations of acceptable sabbath work in the future or whether some rabbis will insist on a more strict interpretation eventually mr lieberman 's conduct could lead to a significant evolution in jewish law and history you can use this as a barometer of how far the jewish community has come said rabbi ismar schorsch chancellor of the jewish theological seminary in new york which serves the conservative branch of judaism when jews lived on the margin they needed an advocate or defender now i would argue that the alleviation from sabbath laws given to the shtadlan should be transferred to jews who have moved into the public arena to serve the common good if senator lieberman leads the way on these questions he may not want to talk about it recently he stirred up a furor by saying on the don imus radio program that there was no ban whatsoever on intermarriage many leading jews criticized him do n't try to be a rabbi they said and the senator now acknowledges that he made a mistake but mr lieberman 's personal attitude was clear when mr imus asked him about the traditional prayer of many orthodox jews thanking god that they are not women there is a prayer like that he replied for a long time i 've skipped that one there 's a certain amount of latitude here with the jewish community as divided as it is between observant and non observant jews and between modern orthodox jews like mr lieberman and more insular orthodox jews known as the haredim such comments will probably continue to create a commotion strictly speaking orthodox jews are uncomfortable with the idea of change in jewish law though mr lieberman may be given dispensations by some rabbis for some acts in his official capacity jewish law itself can not be changed until a universally recognized authority actually rules citing reams of precedent and logical conclusions since late antiquity no such person or body has existed and as a result even among the orthodox what is permitted will inevitably be a matter of conflicting opinions among learned specialists but it is not unreasonable to think that the reality reflected by mr lieberman 's situation may eventually find its way into the pages of jewish legal writings rabbi irving greenberg president of the jewish life network an educational foundation and a friend and spiritual counselor of mr lieberman said jewish law needed to take account of the full integration of jews in american life when the arbiters of jewish law take responsibility for the revolutionary transformation of the jewish condition he said then jewish law will be able to guide those jews who must take responsibility for the larger society

 even the most ardent yankee fans were unsettled by the behavior of roger clemens in the opening moments of sunday 's world series game when the pitcher threw a large jagged piece of broken bat across the path of the mets mike piazza it skittered by without hitting piazza but even so the umpires would have been justified in ejecting clemens from the game they made a judgment call not to do so probably because they did not want to disrupt a championship game that was an understandable decision but major league baseball should make clear to clemens that it will not tolerate any further misconduct during the series umpires and referees usually give professional athletes a bit more latitude in championship contests to insure unfettered competition since clemens 's intent was unknowable to the umpiring crew and no one was hurt in the incident his ejection would have been a severe step that would have deprived the yankees of one of their most effective starting pitchers before the end of the first inning he went on to limit the mets to two hits and no runs over eight innings still throwing a sharp piece of lumber in the direction of another player could have had disastrous consequences none of clemens 's explanations seem satisfactory including the idea that he somehow mistook the bat for the ball clemens plays at a high level of intensity and has overpowered hitters for almost two decades earning a record five cy young awards his fastball often hurtles toward home plate at nearly 100 miles an hour but clemens also has a record of volcanic behavior and it is in that light that sunday 's incident seems more ominous it is important to distinguish between fair and foul forms of intimidation at the ballpark clemens is hardly the first fastball pitcher to direct a speeding baseball high and inside to brush batters back from the plate and plant fear in their minds that is how hardball is played in the major leagues but aiming to hit a batter especially to strike a player on the head crosses the line and under baseball rules can get a pitcher ejected throwing a broken bat in anger which seemed to be the case on sunday can fall into the same category clemens has always competed close to the line and this summer one of his fastballs collided with piazza 's head during an inter league game at yankee stadium he said it was unintentional and he was not ejected from the game but that incident may well have been piazza 's reward for hitting well against clemens over the years including several titanic home runs given that history bud selig the baseball commissioner would be wise to notify the yankees that clemens has no margin for misbehavior if the world series reaches game 6 when clemens would be likely to take the mound again

 the army inspector general 's office has substantiated the accusation by lt gen claudia kennedy the army 's highest ranking woman that she was sexually harassed by another army general according to defense officials the disturbing case shows that ending harassment of women is no easier in the top officer ranks than it is in the barracks general kennedy filed a complaint against maj gen larry smith last summer after general smith 's appointment as the army 's deputy inspector general whose duties would include investigating sexual misconduct complaints she charged that general smith had touched her inappropriately and tried to kiss her in her pentagon office in 1996 army officials have said that she did not complain even informally to her superiors at the time of the incident but investigators were able to interview friends and colleagues who were told of the incident soon after it occurred and they came to believe general kennedy 's account if the findings are upheld by higher authority general smith may be forced to retire and given only a reprimand because officials say the incident does not merit prosecution under the military code of justice by stepping forward to oppose general smith 's appointment to a sensitive position general kennedy has done the army a great service but she was criticized both inside and outside the military after her complaint became public she was even accused of personal misconduct by a retired army officer whose charges were found to be baseless such attempts to undermine her credibility show how much more work needs to be done to eliminate retrograde attitudes toward women in the military

 on tuesday president bush signed an executive order allowing the government to try accused terrorists before military commissions rather than in federal court no matter how tempting or expedient trials by military commission will prove disastrous to the war against terrorism to the constitution and to the rule of law the administration favors such trials because they will allow sensitive evidence to be presented in secret the rules governing the conduct of military commissions would be drawn up by the pentagon without regard to the safeguards and guarantees provided by the constitution and because they are likely to be held abroad the trials would present no domestic security risk and would undoubtedly elicit less coverage from the american media but if the public relations war is as important as the military war as our allies and the administration insist such trials would give the enemy a victory of enormous proportions president mohammad khatami of iran denounced the sept 11 attacks but said he needed evidence that osama bin laden was responsible presenting evidence in secret will convince no one and will only fortify mr bin laden 's propaganda and military executions of convicted terrorists after such trials will create a new generation of martyrs imagine how this looks to the rest of the world timothy mcveigh killed 168 of his fellow citizens yet he was entitled to all the constitutional protections and safeguards of a federal criminal trial held in the united states in public now when the defendants are foreigners most likely muslims the administration of justice is left to an ad hoc military commission acting in secret in a legal sense too such trials will hand the terrorists an important symbolic victory although the united states will claim that they are nonprivileged combatants that is soldiers who have violated the laws of war it would still be acknowledging them as combatants rather than common criminals the trials will thus dignify terrorists as soldiers in islam 's war against america this is exactly the wrong message to send al qaeda members are international outlaws like pirates slave traders or torturers at a deeper level such trials challenge our identity as a people military commissions have been used rarely in the past principally to try spies caught behind enemy lines now we are proposing them as a long term mechanism to achieve one of our principal war aims finding and trying terrorists but we are also according to president bush fighting for the values embodied in our constitution against an enemy that would destroy our way of life how then can we violate those values in the process if we must depart from constitutional practices then the united states should prosecute accused terrorists before an international tribunal the united nations war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia for example tries cases before a panel of three judges not a jury it has developed numerous procedures for presenting key evidence in secret and protecting the identities of crucial witnesses and when slobodan milosevic attempted to exploit the process and grandstand for a television audience the chief judge shut him down in addition it would be easier politically for countries like pakistan egypt or jordan to extradite defendants to an international tribunal than to a secret court run by the united states military the difference between military commissions and an international tribunal is the sanction and legitimacy of the global community an international tribunal would demonstrate the depth of international solidarity against terrorism today we have the opportunity to devise common procedures among nations around the world far beyond the west president bush has said repeatedly that we must bring terrorists to justice trial by military commission is not justice at least not justice as we understand it and preach it to the world justice is on our side we should not forsake it anne marie slaughter is professor of international law at harvard law school

 to the editor re medical fees are often higher for patients without insurance front page april 2 one way to eliminate the problem of higher fees for uninsured patients would be to do away with insurance that covers office visits this would permit doctors to charge the uninsured an affordable price because of the money saved by not having to do insurance billing doctors incomes might come down a bit but if they could get rid of the cost of doing insurance billing they might be willing to make the trade in addition without office insurance patients would be less likely to ask for costly and unnecessary tests and consultations just because they have insurance to pay for it for catastrophic illness medicare could be used to cover everyone edward j volpintesta md bethel conn april 2 2001

 a minor mystery in the current presidential campaign involves the people who turn out to listen to steve forbes 's speeches the mystery would be why as a candidate mr forbes is a guy in a suit who works a room as if he were proctoring a test thanks to his extraordinarily immobile features he always looks precisely the same from nose upward no matter what his mood offstage he hardly seems to exist his staff sort of carts him away when the speeches are over and there are no steve forbes anecdotes either charming or chilling he has spent more than 60 million over the last four years trying to buy his way into the presidential race but he does n't even seem to dabble in conspicuous consumption during his most recent iowa swing he and his wife were spending their rest times at the neighborhood econo lodge but no matter how remote the town or treacherous the weather there 's a roomful of people waiting patiently to hear him speak it 's hard to explain what brings them out since i have finally and reluctantly accepted the fact that he is not hiring them none of his issues seem to have much pull the polls show voters are apathetic about tax cuts of any size let alone one as complicated and controversial as mr forbes 's pet proposal he 's trying to appeal to the christian right this week he said george w bush was a timid abortion opponent while he was bold bold appears to be the adjective of choice this year perhaps this race lacking any other focus will be remembered for recycling old laundry detergent names let 's call the bush tax cuts fab but dissatisfied social conservatives seem to yearn for a candidate with fire in the belly and they can get more passion than mr forbes is offering in alan keyes or gary bauer or the telephone book still the sight of all those upturned faces has energized the candidate sort of i 'm pumped up mr forbes keeps saying with exactly the same expression he uses when vowing to drive a stake through the tax code or inquiring whether everybody liked the free chili the newly peppy speeches sound like an infomercial in which mr forbes explains how we can all become winners in the game of life by instituting a flat tax and privatizing social security you take someone on minimum wage their whole lives they 'll have upwards of 200000 when they retire the serious presidential candidates generally ignore the forbes campaign but in iowa the republican establishment has been attempting to demonize him as an archfiend of negative advertising senator charles grassley is on the radio warning the public to beware of possible anti bush ads as if they were radioactive at the first sign of negativity he urges hang up the phone throw the mail out and change the station while mr bush was busy hammering on john mccain in new hampshire his staff in iowa was complaining that a forbes pamphlet had been rigged to make mr bush 's ears look big if this keeps up mr forbes may actually qualify for the sympathy vote his organization which is the best money can buy may compensate for his lack of pizazz but americans still prefer presidential candidates who seem to have at least a modicum of an idea what they 're getting into and the forbes people want the nation to entrust its security to a guy whose chief claim to fame is that he once ran a business his father gave him you ca n't spend your way around that problem the campaign however is selling his lack of credentials as his big strength and his supporters seem to agree almost invariably they say they are in his corner because he 's not tainted or he does n't run with the ones in washington maybe the mysterious forbes audiences are made up of voters who believed the gingrich revolution would refashion america in their own image when things sort of fizzled out perhaps they gave up on politicians completely and decided to place their bets on someone so uncharismatic he could be trusted not to trick them the way politicians did or on the other hand it could just be that people who live in iowa in the winter have a lot of time on their hands it was either come here or go to exercise class one elderly woman said
 the world health organization has issued a report detailing an ambitious often covert effort by the tobacco industry to curb global anti smoking initiatives dating back to the late 1980 's the campaign 's strategy consisted of having ostensibly independent surrogates attack the credibility of international health organizations and spin the concern with smoking as a first world issue not worthy of the developing world 's attention the who report written partly by dr david kessler the former federal food and drug commissioner relies on tobacco company documents that surfaced in recent lawsuits it accuses the companies of creating bogus front groups misrepresenting research pitting other international organizations against the who and lobbying to cut the organization 's funding perhaps most alarming the report alleges that some consultants served both the who and the tobacco industry it exhorts international health organizations and their member states to develop strong safeguards against such conflicts of interest dr kessler and the three international experts who also contributed to the report were unable to ascertain the extent to which this industry campaign is still being waged but philip morris one of the companies cited said that the tactics depicted in the report were the product of a polarized environment in the past and did not reflect an approach that the company would adopt today even so the who report should be read as a cautionary tale as the health organization starts negotiations in october to frame an international tobacco control treaty negotiators must remain alert lest the beleaguered industry under assault in the american market seek treaty language that would leave consumers unprotected in less sophisticated markets overseas

 because al gore stands an even chance of becoming our next president i thought it would be a good idea to nail down his position on a sleeper issue in this campaign the abuse of computer technology to invade personal privacy the opportunity arose to put the privacy question to the vice president this week at an on the record session with times editors in new york to show that entrapment with a trick question on a complex issue was not my intent i prefaced my query with a brief explanation of the two key words used by both sides in the controversy the word choice is used by banks hospitals and internet companies to conceal their intrusions into the personal lives of their customers they offer us a choice to tell them not to share our most intimate secrets with others but the burden of that decision is on the customer who can be manipulated by a bribe of a gift or a threat of refusal of business the intruders know that most people ca n't be bothered to choose to opt out to take the initiative to defend themselves the word consent is used by those opposed to the placement of cookies spying bugs to track your every online movement in your computer we want to place the burden of seeking your express informed consent on the marketers this means you must first be made aware of who will get what information about you and be told explicitly whether it will be sold or given to some other company or division for a different purpose only if you affirmatively opt in give your permission can they then track your tastes and habits the difference is day and night choice is the misleading word used to cover a phony pass at a privacy policy which retailers insurers and banks are now touting while consent is your valuable power to say yes that they are desperate to deny customers in the sellout engineered last year by the clinton treasury secretary larry summers and the gop senate banking chairman phil gramm the banking lobby won your consent is not required so mr vice president how come you spoke of providing choice in your speech about privacy would you support legislation requiring companies to first obtain the consumer 's consent along with 270 million other americans he replied i use words more carelessly than bill safire and in choosing the word 'choose i did not inform myself of the deeper more subtle meanings which i now see clearly then gore got serious i do n't think an unfair burden should be placed on the users of the internet to affirmatively go out and protect their own privacy he added i think there should be procedures commonly accepted which protect them more or less automatically unless they the internet users take affirmative steps to surrender their privacy that spells consent but i pressed him on legislation to protect financial privacy where his administration has been weak i can tell you what the ideas are that i believe in he said i think that we should have absolute protection of financial privacy as well as medical privacy i do not think that your bank account and the history of what checks you write and to whom ought to be marketable gore warmed to the subject i think that people ought to have a right to expect that will remain private unless they affirmatively give up that right for whatever reason and i do n't think the current law goes far enough in protecting them does that answer your question sure does he also touched my button with it should be illegal to trade in social security numbers that 's the single key fact that is most useful in compiling dossiers at that very moment senator john mccain was holding commerce committee hearings to expose online profiling the turning of net users into ripe selling targets industry snoops are suddenly promising self policing anything to avoid asking consent gore 's stand on the right to privacy is forceful next is for one of us to pin down george w bush bob herbert is on vacation

 to the editor an aug 24 letter writer 's comparison of the federal government and mcdonald 's is too simplistic a better comparison is the government as a landlord of an apartment building the current tax cut situation is akin to a landlord who decides to return some of the rent money to tenants but mostly wealthy ones instead of using rent money for improvements to make the building more livable for everyone with say central air conditioning if so much is returned that central air conditioning becomes unaffordable the poorer tenants suffer and the wealthy ones ca n't see what 's wrong because they can afford their own air conditioning units what happens when critical improvements that affect all tenants become unaffordable robert irie cambridge mass aug 24 2001

 president bush 's secretary of commerce donald evans told more than 1000 scientists economists and other experts attending a conference on global warming last week that their task was to jump start president bush 's new five year program of research into the causes of global warming and possible responses the secretary is just a bit behind the times there is already an enormous body of research on the subject perhaps 20 years worth nearly all of it pointing to the need to adopt exactly the kind of remedial steps that the bush administration has so far refused to take what needs jump starting is not research but policy obviously we could all benefit from research sophisticated modeling can tell us more about global climate change and instruct us in how best to adapt but the world does not need another excuse from mr bush to delay the political steps necessary to begin slowing emissions right away the window is closing fast even now nations are making energy investments that will be with us for years to come the international energy agency predicted recently that 42 trillion would be spent on new electric generating plants over the next 30 years worldwide an average investment of 140 billion a year and that most of these would be using outdated highly polluting technologies every year of delay locks in more outmoded investment adds to the carbon emissions already in the atmosphere and increases the ultimate costs of protecting the environment the need for swift collective action was the premise of the kyoto protocol on global climate change which sought to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 mr bush summarily rejected the kyoto pact shortly after taking office even so the rest of the world still looks to the united states for guidance and technology this leaves it to a divided congress to make the tough calls that mr bush has avoided the immediate remedies are plain enough cleaner cars and cleaner power plants mr bush opposes any mandatory limits on carbon dioxide pollution from either source preferring a voluntary approach but voluntary steps have not worked with industry in the past and will not now while some companies are eager to do something about global warming on their own using available technologies the private sector as a whole will not make serious investments in cleaner plants or more efficient automobiles as long as the rules favor dirtier and more profitable alternatives aging coal fired power plants and gas guzzling suv 's the rules have to change there will undoubtedly be another effort in congress to increase fuel economy standards and there are two bills moving through the senate that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by combining mandatory caps with substantial market based financial rewards for operating more efficiently the prospects for such legislation have not been improved of course by the election results and the ascendancy to key committee chairmanships of conservatives who like mr bush worry about asking for any real sacrifice from industry even so mr bush knows that his own clean air legislation which seeks new controls on every major air pollutant except the gas that causes global warming stands little chance of success unless he also addresses the issue of carbon dioxide in other words if he wants progress on any air pollutant he may finally be forced to deal with the most frightening one of all unless he does all the research in the world wo n't help a bit
 former president bill clinton will never look out at us from behind bars he will 1 escape indictment by the new grand jury 2 be acquitted at trial or 3 be pardoned in advance with jail to the chief not an option we can begin to weigh the arguments about prosecution the record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence decided federal judge susan webber wright in the paula jones suit that the president responded to plaintiff 's questions by giving false misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the judicial process judge wright fined clinton 90000 for civil contempt leaving it to the independent counsel to pursue the criminal charge with no risk of double jeopardy wisely clinton did not appeal but the president had repeated his false testimony under oath to a federal grand jury if any other citizen lies both in court and before a grand jury prosecution follows after the house impeachment the senate voted largely on party lines not to remove him because his wrongdoing did not amount to high crimes many senators voting to acquit explained that the wrongdoer could be prosecuted after he left office for these lower crimes of perjury and obstruction the general feeling was that he had been lying about extramarital sex which so many do what needed correcting was the privacy invasive sexual harassment law that lets a plaintiff demand that a defendant reveal experience with others it 's a bad law but it is a law that clinton signed and when the oath is broken in plain view by the national leader sworn to uphold it its enforcement becomes unavoidable if a president is allowed to testify falsely with impunity then so could everybody else and without equal compulsion to tell the truth equal justice becomes a mockery how do we uphold the law when most of the country wants to move on it 's not enough to say the possible perjurer has been punished enough or that prosecution is expensive the way to preserve the power of the oath to coerce truthful testimony is to apply the equal justice standard but then to follow the constitution 's willingness to make it unequal asked in april by newspaper editors about a presidential pardon by clinton 's successor al gore said president clinton is way ahead of you on this he said publicly some time ago that he would neither request or accept a pardon before the same group a day later clinton left out the accept part the answer is i have no interest in it i would n't ask for it gore treats the question of pardon as mooted by clinton 's dismissal of the idea and too many have bought the notion that a pardon must be sought or accepted that 's not so controlling legal authority is in biddle v perovich 1927 a case in which a convict objected to the method of a presidential commutation of his sentence just as the original punishment would be imposed without regard to the prisoner 's consent and in the teeth of his will wrote justice holmes for the supreme court whether he liked it or not the public welfare not his consent determines what shall be done nowhere is it written that a pardon must be requested it can come on the president 's initiative as when ford pardoned nixon the pardoned person can refuse but the merciful deed is done in the teeth of his will prosecution stops the accused or convicted is free martyrdom denied like it or not see margaret colgate love 's analysis in the june 2000 fordham urban law journal this means gore will have to stop dancing away from the question as if the pardon decision were somehow shared with the pardonee it 's time he chose the hard right over the easy wrong answer for bush it would be an opportunity to demonstrate nonpartisan compassion on a grand scale let the independent counsel and grand jury lay out detailed charges if the evidence calls for it with no political consideration or fear of retribution as the law demands that 's the punishment of humiliation then if need be with no folderol about request or acceptance let the new president intervene with a pardon as article ii section 2 of the constitution gives him exclusive power to do that 's constitutional justice that 's the system working

 the bush administration might as well have sent charlton heston president of the national rifle association to deliver its opening address to a united nations conference on small arms earlier this week in a shameless subordination of diplomacy to domestic political pandering john r bolton the under secretary of state for arms control and international security told the gathering that washington would not support an agreement to curb the international flow of illicit small arms if it infringed on the right of americans to bear arms the united nations estimates that there are more than 500 million small arms in the world assault rifles machine guns grenade launchers and such and that they are used to kill at least half a million people each year mostly in third world war zones like sierra leone congo angola sri lanka and colombia the great majority of casualties are civilians the aim of the un conference is to produce a modest set of global standards and tracing methods that could help curtail the illicit flow of weapons that magnify civil wars arm child soldiers and militia gangs and expand the power of organized crime the clinton administration was at the forefront of international efforts to curtail small arms trafficking and american laws restricting the export of these weapons are models for international standards but the nra and other groups have claimed that international curbs on small arms trafficking represent an attempt by the united nations to interfere with american domestic firearms policy mr bolton 's address faithfully followed the nra script the draft documents before the conference would not infringe on gun ownership in the united states and in any case the conference 's plan of action will not be legally binding on any nation the conference is not about taking guns away from americans but about preventing guns from reaching the world 's dictators and warlords the substantive impact of mr bolton 's words on an already watered down agreement may be limited but by signaling its skepticism about small arms curbs washington may have stalled what little momentum there was toward broader international cooperation against the small arms trade his speech affords political cover for other major weapons producers like russia and china that have been recalcitrant about effective international curbs not to mention the cash poor governments in africa asia and latin america that have been their faithful customers

 the contempt trial of charles bakaly iii is something of a curiosity in washington in a town where leaks flow like a powerful torrent down every avenue the prosecution of a spokesman based on an innocuous disclosure seems almost comically misplaced nevertheless mr bakaly who was the spokesman for the independent counsel kenneth starr is facing a criminal conviction for denying that he was the source for a new york times reporter in january 1999 for defense attorneys the prosecution of a government lawyer would have been welcome if it were for leaking information that could not legally be made public government lawyers routinely leak facts from grand jury proceedings and commit other ethical violations with no response from most federal judges but mr bakaly is not in the dock on such a charge he is accused of criminal contempt under a rule that punishes false statements that delay or obstruct a court the statements and the delay however came after a legal error of the court itself which misinterpreted a federal law the decision to initiate an inquiry into confidential communications raised serious concerns for lawyers who handle high profile cases the decision to pursue a criminal case against mr bakaly only magnifies those concerns mr bakaly 's problem began with a times article citing unnamed associates in the office of the independent counsel in explaining options for the investigation the article said that the office was still considering indicting the president and that his impeachment would not affect the ultimate decision of whether to prosecute these options had been widely discussed by various legal commentators and it was already well known that as the article also said some on mr starr 's staff favored prosecution unlike a typical grand jury case where a target 's identity is confidential the independent counsel 's investigation was aimed quite publicly at the president the preference by some lawyers in mr starr 's office for prosecution is hardly surprising the problem was not the content of the article but its timing it appeared at a critical stage in the impeachment of president clinton for most judges the article would have justified no more than a tongue lashing in chambers but in a critical error chief judge norma holloway johnson decided the article contained secret grand jury information though nothing in it remotely resembled such information she wanted a prosecution under the federal grand jury law which could have brought a lengthy prison sentence the court of appeals however disagreed and found that the article did not contain any secret grand jury information judge johnson then proceeded to fashion a criminal contempt violation against mr bakaly a charge that gives her enormous discretion and allows her to sit in judgment without a jury mr bakaly was now charged with lying to the court in denying that he was a source of the information and then having his office file false papers denying that it was the origin of the information mr bakaly insists that he truthfully denied releasing nonpublic information and admitted he had spoken with the reporter more is at stake here than the future of an accused leaker with a penchant for mismatched outfits most judges are uncomfortable with statements in the press about pending cases and would like lawyers to keep monastic silence lawyers however need to defend their clients both in court and in public all parties even the government are allowed to speak to reporters so long as their comments do not influence or prejudice a case or release information under seal judge johnson says she will convict mr bakaly if the government can show that his statements required the court to hold two in chambers conferences with outside counsel or imposed unnecessary work or costs hardly grievous injuries none of this completely exonerates mr bakaly who should have been more forthcoming at the outset of the inquiry moreover the use of leaks by all sides in the clinton crisis was itself a scandal in a city of habitual leakers however the prosecution of mr bakaly offers no more justice than a random execution for collective guilt jonathan turley a criminal defense lawyer is a law professor at george washington university
 to the editor re swearing fealty to ethanol editorial dec 3 the use and expansion of ethanol america 's major home grown renewable liquid fuel address both oil dependency and global warming and as you admit ethanol is cleaner than some other additives currently used in gasoline so why criticize those who see the efficacy of increased ethanol production for its economic energy and environmental benefits you should recognize the importance to farmers and rural communities of expanding the production of ethanol the greatest growth in ethanol production is coming from new farmer owned co ops given the benefits to rural economies reducing oil import dependency and pollution it is not surprising that presidential candidates promote ethanol development what is surprising is your antipathy bob dinneen president renewable fuels assn washington dec 3 2003

 officials at the college board are planning to change the sat again they might add some tougher math questions drop the section on analogies even include an essay they are scheduled to consider the changes in june one month later the board of regents of the university of california is scheduled to vote on a plan to drop the test altogether in favor of an exam more closely related to what students learn in high school but i 'm not sure you can design a test that fairly assesses what students learn in high school college bound students will tell you that they do n't go to school to learn math vocabulary or any other subject for them the main purpose of high school is to get into college and this is the time of year when they find out whether their high school careers have been worthwhile some learn to do whatever it takes to reach this goal even if it means scheming and cheating they feel compelled to copy answers cut corners and kiss up to teachers to achieve the high grades and test scores they need for college they are not proud of these tactics many would actually prefer to get good grades honestly but they have too much work in their honors level courses and too many extracurricular activities they know they must compete with the two million or so students who take the sat each year and therefore feel the need to compromise their values sacrifice their sleep and give up the conventional notion of a high school social life just as high achieving students learn to do school they learn to do tests like the sat as early as the fifth or sixth grade students take practice sat 's test prep courses teach students routine tricks to maximize their scores eliminate unlikely answers respond to the most common vocabulary and math questions first leave the longer questions for later the sat experience not unlike the college admissions process has become a time consuming distraction so what can be done revising the sat is not likely to have much of an effect nearly 300 colleges have eliminated the requirement for applicants to take the sat or other standardized tests they know that the use of such tests is limited many of these colleges rely more heavily on teacher recommendations student interviews essays and transcripts their admissions officers travel the country visiting high schools assessing the quality of their curriculums and comparing their grading standards a few universities allow students to submit portfolios of their work and narrative assessments from teachers in lieu of grades this approach to admissions of course takes more time but by devaluing test scores and by emphasizing more qualitative review methods colleges may be able to assess more effectively the traits that help students succeed in college especially traits that are difficult to measure on standardized tests problem solving skills creativity and motivation for some large universities this kind of personal attention may seem impossible perhaps colleges and high schools can work together to devise ways to minimize the increased workload and the college board itself is a potential source of expertise and resources to help improve the process it might take on the difficult task of developing strategies to review student portfolios and creating other qualitative assessments we should n't delude ourselves into thinking that revising the sat will transform the high school experience in any meaningful way instead of discussing ways to revise the sat the college board and universities should be asking how to reform the entire college admissions process denise clark pope is a lecturer in the school of education at stanford and author of doing school how we are creating a generation of stressed out materialistic and miseducated students

 to the editor it is troubling to see politicians threatening the entertainment industry with government intervention if it does n't make attempts to curb violence front page sept 14 perhaps these mostly middle aged men have forgotten that in their childhood they probably enjoyed countless westerns gangster dramas or war movies it would be ludicrous to assume that any of these men assumed a life of crime as a result of watching the carnage depicted in those movies one can only hope that those who threaten intrusive legislation recognize that the gratuitous violence one finds in hollywood films is no more capable of desensitizing a child today than it was 40 years ago cody lyon new york sept 14 2000
 if anyone ever needed to measure the dedication of the new york times 's employees to this newspaper the level of anguish generated by the jayson blair incident is a pretty good standard the discovery that one young reporter had faked or plagiarized a large number of articles drew extensive news coverage but the publicity outside the paper paled next to the anger and soul searching within this week howell raines the executive editor and gerald boyd the managing editor decided that the backwash from the blair affair was keeping them from providing the effective leadership the times needs yesterday they resigned mr raines had been in charge of the newsroom for less than two years a period when the paper won eight pulitzer prizes only days after he became editor terrorists destroyed the world trade center and under his direction the paper provided coverage of the aftermath that marked one of the proudest periods in the times 's 152 year history yesterday when the times 's publisher arthur sulzberger jr recounted both men 's extraordinary accomplishments over their careers he said this is a day that breaks my heart and he was not alone before he became executive editor mr raines was in charge of this page under his tenure and perhaps under the tenure of every times editorial page editor in history there were occasions when the editorial board called for a public or corporate official to resign sometimes the officials were men and women of distinguished prior achievements and sometimes the storms that came down on their heads were not primarily of their own making but a leader 's fight to reclaim control of a job gone sour can sap energy away from the institution he or she is trying to lead the welfare of a great institution is always more important than the careers of the people who run it mr raines and mr boyd understood that and that was the reason they chose to leave joseph lelyveld who retired as executive editor in 2001 has returned for a short period to provide continuity until a new leadership team is appointed the good of any particular institution depends on its people but this one depends equally on the confidence that readers place in it a confidence based on the belief that every day the paper struggles mightily to get things right journalism is an imperfect business the work of reporting understanding and writing about the complexity of human affairs like all human enterprises journalism is not perfectible but it should always be heading in that direction the forced introspection the times has been going through since the jayson blair story surfaced will in the long run be healthy a string of rather spectacular successes might have made us too cocky too sure that the future would simply bring more of the same now we are re examining some of our internal rules and structures the recent weeks have not been particularly enjoyable for those of us on the inside but even in the moments of greatest internal stress the reporters and editors have done their jobs that comes from the strength of the institution mr raines and mr boyd quit to protect that strength and their sacrifice simply gives the rest of us one more reason to work toward that perpetual goal of the perfect report

 to the editor i was disappointed if not surprised by richard bernstein 's selection of ulysses as one of the great hits headed for the attic the millennium section jan 1 the profound influence ulysses has had on the great writers of the 20th century should belie on its own such a bold assertion vladimir nabokov counted joyce 's novel among his four favorite works of 20th century literature and as the only one of the four written in english to dismiss ulysses is not merely to question the product of a modernist movement but to disregard the inspiration for a century 's worth of great fiction alexander rubens new york jan 1 2000

 to the editor re adjusting drug policy editorial feb 27 the great majority of american drug users are occasional adult smokers of cannabis they use marijuana grown in the united states do not need treatment and are educated about the risks of cannabis use they hold jobs they raise children they pay taxes they are indistinguishable from their friends colleagues and neighbors except that they occasionally smoke cannabis it is unlikely that we can or should interdict treat or educate ourselves out of the demand problem created by these users nor can we arrest our way out of the problem we must accept that recreational drug users are here to stay that they do not belong in jail and that if merchants do not supply them criminals will gregory y porter washington feb 27 2001
 to the editor the political debate about american military force readiness front page sept 4 is really about the readiness of the army neither the air force nor the navy sends planes or ships into harm 's way unless they have full crews and arsenals historically an army unit is deployed if needed whether it is ready or not since no unit is ever 100 percent ready readiness status should be measured by the time that it will take a unit to become ready some advocate a change in accounting readiness for example requiring units to be prepared to fight only one regional conflict instead of two but by lowering our strategic objectives we tempt would be aggressors to take advantage of our inability to fight on two fronts simultaneously a better solution would be a strategy that could support a continuing war and deter a wider war as advocated by president harry s truman at the beginning of the korean war joe muckerman alexandria va sept 4 2000 the writer was director of emergency planning for the pentagon from 1986 to 1992
 the white house has thrown its weight behind an effort to save the nomination of charles pickering to a federal appeals court senator orrin hatch denounced opposition to judge pickering as a lynching last week and he forced the postponement of a judiciary committee decision when the nomination appeared doomed to go down on a party line vote perhaps mr hatch and other conservative republicans worry that if judge pickering is rejected president bush will be forced to reconsider his strategy of using seats on federal courts as a sop to the right wing we can only hope that would be so unfortunately there are a lot of other disappointing nominees where judge pickering came from the bush administration has 53 judicial nominations pending in the senate some even more troubling than this one there is a danger that despite the republicans record of blockading well qualified moderate judicial nominees during the clinton administration democrats in the senate will become tired of being called obstructionist and give way there is too much at stake for that to happen while attention to judicial nominations usually focuses on the supreme court few who go to the courts seeking justice get that far the supreme court docket has been shrinking and is now roughly 85 cases a year lately the justices have stayed on the sidelines in many of the most contentious legal battles like california 's ban on affirmative action by state agencies and the microsoft antitrust litigation as a result the federal appellate courts one step below the supreme court have never been more influential judges on the 13 circuit courts of appeal are continually issuing decisions in cases involving everything from employment discrimination to the environment and abortion that often become the last word on our rights as americans as the struggle over federal court nominees goes on it is critical that rather than focusing on personalities senators define what qualifies someone to be a federal judge and what minimum standards they will apply to the president 's choices first and foremost the senate should make clear that it will accept only nominees for federal judgeships who are well qualified by education and experience the federal bench especially at the appellate level is no place for on the job training second there should be no significant question about a nominee 's ethics particularly as they affect performance on the bench senators also have an obligation to consider a nominee 's judicial philosophy and ideology the president has a right within reasonable bounds to name individuals whose philosophy he finds compatible but the senate has a duty to reject anyone whose views are outside the modern mainstream judgeships are lifetime appointments every nominee should be devoted to freedom of speech and the guarantees in the bill of rights sensitive to the civil rights of women and minorities and respectful of congress 's constitutional power to safeguard those rights and the environment if the senators adhere honestly to those criteria it is likely that they will find a number of the bush administration 's current crop of nominees unacceptable senators must then find the courage and the energy to reject the nominations if anyone becomes defensive about the president 's inability to get his judicial picks confirmed it should be mr bush
 to the editor in your june 20 news article about the failed transaction between the connecticut resources recovery administration and enron you quote representative michael p lawlor 's assertion that no prosecutor appears to be willing to investigate political corruption in connecticut in fact the opposite is the case as recent convictions prove legislators need not issue subpoenas to compel sworn testimony because they already held a hearing that all of the major figures attended voluntarily answering all questions on the record the fbi the united states attorney the attorney general the state ethics commission and the chief state 's attorney have been investigating the authority for months perhaps their failure to bring an indictment is due not to their alleged lethargy but to the absence of credible evidence that the authority committed a crime william h nickerson state senator 36th district hartford june 24 2002
 to the editor ellen willis op ed may 28 paints a chillingly accurate portrait of american campuses with corporate ideology seeping like swamp gas through the cracks of our shared governance process as a professor in a public university organized by the american association of university professors i see an unexpected consequence our need to hold the administration to the rules of bargaining over salary workload and research support produces a culture in which these vital issues are discussed only at the table in formal negotiations this makes sense when a contract is about to expire but between negotiations a self imposed gag order precludes the faculty senate from initiating campuswide debate on the central issue of governance how the faculty does its work strikes are a last resort the first preventive step is for the faculty senate to discuss policy alternatives before union spokesmen get to the table joanna vecchiarelli scott ann arbor mich may 30 2001 the writer is a professor of political science eastern michigan university
 the president tells us the economy is accelerating and the statistics seem to bear him out but do n't hold your breath waiting for your standard of living to improve bush country is not a good environment for working families in the real world which is the world of families trying to pay their mortgages and get their children off to college the economy remains troubled while the analysts and commentators of the comfortable class are assuring us that the president 's tax cuts and the billions being spent on iraq have been good for the gross domestic product the workaday folks are locked in a less sanguine reality it 's a reality in which the number of americans living in poverty has increased by three million in the past two years the median household income has fallen for the past two years the number of dual income families particularly those with children under 18 has declined sharply the administration can spin its recovery any way it wants but working families ca n't pay their bills with data about the gross domestic product they need the income from steady employment and when it comes to employment the bush administration has compiled the worst record since the great depression the jobs picture is far more harrowing than it is usually presented by the media despite modest wage increases for those who are working the unemployment rate is 61 percent which represents almost nine million people millions more have become discouraged and left the labor market and there are millions of men and women who are employed but working significantly fewer hours than they 'd like jared bernstein a senior economist at the economic policy institute has taken a look at the hours being worked by families rather than individuals it 's a calculation that gets to the heart of a family 's standard of living the declines he found were of a magnitude that 's historically been commensurate with double digit unemployment rates he said it was not just that there were fewer family members working the ones who were employed were working fewer hours according to government statistics there are nearly 45 million people working part time because they have been unable to find full time work in many cases as the outplacement firm challenger gray christmas noted in a recent report the part time worker is earning far less money than his or her background and experience warrant ie a computer programmer working at a coffee shop economists expect some modest job creation to occur over the next several months but there 's a just in time for the election quality to the current economic surge and even republicans are worried that the momentum may not last the president has played his tax cut card the spending on iraq most americans fervently hope will not go on indefinitely and president bush 's own treasury secretary is talking about an inevitable return to higher interest rates where 's the jobs creation miracle in this dismal mix meanwhile these are some of the things working and jobless americans continue to face sharply increasing local taxes including property taxes steep annual increases in health care costs soaring tuition costs at public and private universities families are living very close to the edge economically and this situation is compounded made even more precarious by the mountains of debt american families are carrying mortgages overloaded credit cards college loans etc the bush administration has made absolutely no secret of the fact that it is committed to the interests of the very wealthy leona helmsley is supposed to have said that only the little people pay taxes the bush crowd has turned that into a national fiat a cornerstone of post depression policy in this country has been a commitment to policies aimed at raising the standard of living of the poor and the middle class that 's over when it comes to jobs taxes education and middle class entitlement programs like social security the message from the bush administration could n't be clearer you 're on your own op ed columnist e mail bobherb nytimescom

 to the editor re decisions on death cases raise questions of race news article feb 14 attorney general john ashcroft 's decision to require local prosecutors to seek the death penalty not only disregards the judgments of those most familiar with the case it also makes little law enforcement sense under the local prosecutors strategy they can gain valuable information from a well placed source about the violent activities of other dangerous criminals the source would still face significant punishment others could be successfully prosecuted and incapacitated and the lives of their other potential victims would be saved as a result of mr ashcroft 's decision prosecutors will now be forced to pursue execution of the source thereby depriving the government of his testimony weakening its ability to convict other dangerous criminals and jeopardizing the lives of their future victims alan vinegrad new york feb 15 2003 the writer was a united states attorney for the eastern district of new york
 at a time when there seemed to be more than enough bad news to go around we woke up on saturday morning to tv bulletins about a missing space shuttle and then pictures of a disintegrating burning spacecraft streaking across the sky there was no way of knowing and there may be no way of knowing for days or months what went wrong with the space shuttle columbia there was only the realization that we were watching the death of seven astronauts and the scattering of their shuttle over the texas countryside the columbia is lost president bush told the nation there are no survivors it is difficult to conceive of these deaths which occurred in the boundary between space and the outer atmosphere in a moment in which normal flight shifted into catastrophe there had been joking about the seamlessness of the 16 day mission after a brief moment of concern at the start when a piece of insulation broke off the fuel tank and hit the left wing one of the many questions nasa will now have to examine is whether that incident did more damage to the shuttle than agency technicians initially suspected the fact that several sensors in that area of the shuttle shut down moments before the disaster could be an indication that yesterday 's fatal problems originated there the families who had gathered to celebrate columbia 's return to florida were gathered up and whisked away to be confronted with the terrible news there is something particularly awful about the vision of people waiting for a moment of joy and proud achievement suddenly smashing up against pain and loss instead no one who watched over and over as tv replayed the pictures of the explosion of the challenger in 1986 can forget that terrible picture the glowing expectations of mothers and fathers and wives and children torn away in a second and replaced by a kind of gaping numbness once again we were jolted out of a sustained period of success and safety in exploring the world outside our planet a run of good work and good luck that ran so long we had the luxury of taking it all for granted most americans were probably cheerfully unaware over the past 16 days that seven men and women were circling the planet conducting scientific experiments and then yesterday setting course for home it is amazing to realize as president bush said in his brief address that it has become easy to overlook the dangers of travel by rocket now once again we read the biographies of men and women who will not return we will admire their achievements for the first time as we are grieving their lives were cut short rick husband the mission commander william mccool the shuttle pilot david brown michael anderson laurel clark kalpana chawla and ilan ramon we will note over and over that despite the presence of colonel ramon an israeli pilot this was a very american crew men and women black and white immigrant and native born colonel ramon was already a hero in his country for his military exploits but with this flight he represented the desperate desire of his tortured nation to be part of peaceful progress to achieve great things in endeavors apart from the perpetual crisis that israel endures colonel ramon 's presence led nasa officials to order additional security measures for this flight but there was no early indication that terrorism or sabotage had anything to do with the tragedy in this particular moment of mourning our feelings were pure not tinged with vengeance or retribution or anger just unmitigated sadness
 to the editor bill mckibben op ed march 27 suggests that fear of leaving the natural world behind is spurring an alliance between environmental groups and conservatives to oppose human cloning even for medical research but in taking advantage of science to combat disease genetic defects infertility and the risks of childbirth we have long since left behind what 's natural instead of rejecting therapeutic cloning as the first step on a slippery slope to eugenics mr mckibben and other concerned progressives should draw the line where it really belongs to prohibit applications of biotechnology that serve no curative purpose to let the fear of the unnatural dictate policy on cloning would be to let irrationalism triumph over the ethical pursuit of our desire to reduce suffering and improve the quality of life for millions thomas w clark somerville mass march 29 2002

 marching across the south in 1865 union soldiers seized up to 900000 acres of abandoned property some radical northerners hoped to use this land to provide freed slaves with the now legendary 40 acres and a mule as restitution for slavery their hopes were obviously dashed but the argument for reparations lives on nearly 140 years later while few doubt that slavery was a great wrong the challenge before us is how to make things right through financial restitution but just how would we devise a practical formula to determine who gets what most assessments start with the notion of payment for lost wages one researcher took 1860 's prices for slaves as an estimate of their labor value and applied compound interest the result 2 trillion to 4 trillion six generations after slavery 's demise such approaches present serious difficulties there are issues of what to do with whites and blacks who immigrated here after slavery ended what about descendants of blacks who lived freely during the antebellum period does someone who is born to a white parent and a black parent cancel out it would take solomon to solve this perhaps the issue needs to be looked at differently one way is to recognize slavery as an institution upon which america 's wealth was built if we take this view it is not important whether a white family arrived in 1700 or in 1965 if you wear cotton blue jeans if you take out an insurance policy if you buy from anyone who has a connection to the industries that were built on chattel labor then you have benefited from slavery likewise if you are black regardless of when your ancestors arrived you live with slavery 's stigma extending the reparations argument this broadly frees one to move beyond the issue of lost wages and seek out other factors on which to base a formula if there were one statistic that captured the persistence of racial inequality it would be net worth the typical white family enjoys a net worth that is more than eight times that of its black counterpart according to the economist edward wolff even at equivalent income levels gaps remain large among families earning less than 15000 a year the median african american family has a net worth of zero while the corresponding white family has 10000 in equity the typical white family earning 40000 annually has a nest egg of around 80000 its black counterpart has about half that amount this equity inequity is partly the result of the head start whites enjoy in accumulating and passing on assets some economists estimate that up to 80 percent of lifetime wealth accumulation results from gifts from earlier generations ranging from the down payment on a home to a bequest by a parent if the government used such net worth inequality as a basis and then factored in measures like population size it could address reparations by transferring about 13 percent of white household wealth to blacks a two adult black family would receive an average reparation of about 35000 what would be the effect of wealth redistribution on such a vast scale my own research using national data to follow black and white adolescents into adulthood shows that when we compare families with the same net worth blacks are more likely to finish high school than whites and are equally likely to complete a bachelor 's degree racial differences in welfare rates disappear thus one generation after reparations were paid racial gaps in education should close eliminating the need for affirmative action the unpopularity of this radical plan would no doubt be unprecedented there are also no guarantees that reparations would be a magic bullet for lingering racial problems that said it remains vital especially during black history month to explore formulas and keep the reparations debate alive it is important because each resulting dollar amount implies a theory of race history and equal opportunity that includes the figure implicit in our current policy zero which rests on the most absurd assumption of all that slavery did n't matter dalton conley associate professor of sociology and director of the center for advanced social science research at new york university is author of being black living in the red race wealth and social policy in america and honky
 to the editor re bush leans toward new agency to control who and what enters front page march 20 although i believe that tom daschle the senate majority leader is justified in demanding that tom ridge the director of homeland security testify before congress the bigger issue is the failure of washington to accept consolidation of the agencies that exert control over who and what enters our country the feeble replies from the agencies that recoiled at the prospect of losing major parts of their departments exhibit their lack of understanding of the threat to our national security the private sector frequently shifts priorities and merges companies and jobs are lost the most ambitious plan advocated by mr ridge should be adopted if we are to maintain confidence in our safety steven a ludsin new york march 20 2002

 every ramadan i learn something new when i attended catholic grade school in colorado i usually sat out of religion class and read textbooks about islam that my mom had bought for me the books said that muslims must fast when they are old enough once a year to remember god to experience suffering and to learn self control the last reason always perplexed me every year my mother would tell stories about ramadan when she was little and growing up in pakistan how the table at sunset would be full of delicacies how she and her siblings would hold handfuls of food in front of their mouths waiting for the cue from my grandfather to eat at the end of the month of fasting he would sacrifice a lamb in the name of god and feed it to the poor the first time i fasted was when i was 14 and attending school away from home marching up to the man in charge of the cafeteria i fully expected to be rebuffed when i asked for food to take back to my dorm for a predawn breakfast but he just looked me in the eyes and asked what i would like to eat had i not been so stunned by his acceptance i might have asked for a table full of pakistani treats later that night nibbling on the turkey sandwich he gave me i proudly told another girl in my dorm i 'm fasting for ramadan for the first time i was doing something that was n't primarily for my parents or for good grades by fasting i was doing something for god in college on saturday nights other muslim students and i would take the school van to a pancake house at 4 am i told my non muslim friends who always accompanied me to dinner in the dining hall at sunset how the entire holy month of ramadan to me was about feeling suffering and deprivation this impression was reinforced by the fancy brochures my family and other muslims i know received in the mail around ramadan they came from islamic charities and described how with only a small donation one could feed a muslim family in bosnia for a month giving to charity is a central tenet of islam and a tradition during ramadan ramadan begins tonight but this year i do n't have much enthusiasm for telling people i 'm fasting with the rev jerry falwell referring to muhammad as a terrorist and the rev franklin graham calling islam a very evil and wicked religion i ca n't help but feel that anything that sounds islamic will be perceived as anti american if you had told me at ramadan two years ago that i would swallow hard before entering airport security or before logging onto my e mail account for fear of receiving another nasty anti muslim message i would have laughed i have a hard time believing many things this ramadan that my mother 's donation to feed a muslim family in bosnia probably landed her name on a list at the justice department that my grandmother ca n't ask a relative to take money to the shrines of sufi saints in pakistan and india like she always does for fear of coming under suspicion for laundering money for terrorist causes that i ca n't attend a mosque gathering to open the holiday without worrying that my license plate number will be put in a file of mosque goers if self control means resolving my frustration at not feeling free to practice my faith as i did as a little girl if self control means not being able to give to charity at the precise time my god has asked me to help others then i now know why god wanted muslims to learn self control every ramadan i learn something new asma gull hasan is author of american muslims the new generation

 to the editor we must hope that robert wright 's analysis of the deep contradictions and perils within our new national security strategy gets a broad and thorough hearing contradictions of a superpower op ed sept 29 from mr wright 's conclusions it seems that the parallels that many are drawing between these days and the time of the gulf of tonkin resolution of 1964 are not nearly strong enough we have to look back 50 years earlier to 1914 when the world was plunged into its first global blood bath let us not forget that the disaster of world war i was needlessly brought about by leaders who emphasized national resolution and by all those who mindlessly followed them without thoroughly examining the possible consequences of choosing above all else to appear strong and unified bruce novak chicago sept 29 2002

 to the editor the debate over stem cell research has led us back to the discussion about when life begins news article aug 15 i submit that this is not the right question human life is a continuous process the sperm and egg are living cells its impossible to decide when life begins the real question is at what point is it appropriate for the state to intervene and protect human life arguments about the soul entering the body have no place in a discussion about public policy since they fall into the realm of theology and can not be proved the decision about when the state should begin jurisdiction over life must consider a number of factors including to the best of our ability the degree of harm involved in working with and discarding embryos and the practicality and costs of enforcement art cohen boston aug 15 2001
 to the editor your april 11 editorial in which you assert that the supreme court 's proceedings should be televised neglects the fact that the court was designed to be insulated from public opinion preventing its proceedings from being televised is an important protection because the effectiveness of the court relies on the justices insulation from public pressure other branches of the government must worry about public opinion but the supreme court is the one that follows only the law it should not have to worry about anything else clay davis springfield ohio april 11 2000
 to the editor senator evan bayh 's suggestion that the democratic party is in danger of being taken over by the far left front page july 29 completely disregards the importance of democratic voters in shaping party ideology the popularity of howard dean is not a coup but proof of how overwhelmingly his positions resonate with democratic voters should the democratic leadership continue to misinterpret the concerns of so many of its members the party will continue to flounder senator bayh and the democratic leadership council should recognize that listening not blazing trails blindly shows true leadership sarah gevlin stuyvesant ny july 29 2003

 supporters of a manned mission to mars have been out in force since nasa 's announcement last week that there are recent perhaps even current sources of liquid water on the planet they argue that water will enable human colonies to thrive but it would be foolhardy to bend the findings to justify a manned mission the quest for life has become the focus of nasa 's mars program and without question the discovery of persuasive evidence for it there is none yet would have profound implications for our perception of our place in the universe if life is not even unique to earth within our solar system it may be common in the cosmos at large finding life or the fossilized signs of it means following the water for without liquid water life can not exist by this reasoning we should perhaps be looking instead to jupiter 's moon europa which seems to have a global ocean of salty water beneath its icy crust but mars is nearer and in many respects more earth like besides it has sentimental attractions dating from the astronomer percival lowell 's claims in the 1890 's to have seen canals built by a dying civilization to the later fantasies of h g wells and edgar rice burroughs the evidence that water once flowed on mars is all but incontrovertible the planet is covered with sinuous channels that can not easily be interpreted as anything other than dried up river valleys these features are at least a billion years old but the new findings reveal that at least some of this water went underground the gullies now seen by the orbiting mars global surveyor appear to be young in geological terms which means they might be anywhere from a million years to a week old the discovery another triumph for the global surveyor demonstrates just how effective unmanned missions can be and at 165 million it is something of a bargain but nasa knows too well that cheap missions can be false economies in september last year the mars climate orbiter was lost followed in december by the mars polar lander the victim of human calculation errors these experiences have forced nasa to rethink its strategy it was trying to do too much with too little to answer a barrage of scientific questions with budget spacecraft that in the end cut too many corners yet the impulse to use unmanned craft was the right one simple focused missions can pay rich dividends as the 1997 pathfinder mission demonstrated by successfully landing on mars and returning new images of the planet 's environment there is much more science to be reaped from unmanned orbiter and lander missions than from the hubristic endeavor at many times the cost to put people on martian soil nasa would do well to resist the temptation to act upon the invitation inherent in the words of dr michael malin who heads the global surveyor imaging team one of the most interesting and significant aspects of this discovery is what it could mean if human explorers ever go to mars he said explaining how useful water would be for drinking or splitting into hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel while cathedral science huge projects that are more inspirational than useful has its place we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the supposed glamour of manned space flight the unmanned mars missions are themselves cathedrals of which nasa can be proud and they needed no passengers to make that so philip ball a consulting editor at nature is the author of life 's matrix a biography of water

 to the editor an overhaul of the federal tax code could be a tremendous boon to the country but not as the administration is contemplating it front page july 16 like the president 's recent tax cut a flat income tax or national sales tax would tend to be regressive and could sap revenues other tools like value added taxes and payroll taxes penalize desirable things like productivity and employment but there is an alternative that would enhance efficiency ecology and fairness a tax on resource consumption with nonrenewable resources taxed at a higher rate than renewable ones such a tax along with a simple revenue neutral income tax for redistributive purposes would be a sound basis for a simplified and sensible tax code howard slatkin new york july 16 2001 the writer is an urban planner
 in the 1976 election campaign jimmy carter vowed to withdraw us troops from south korea when mr carter won the first words he had to eat were his vow to withdraw us troops from south korea as congress and the allies revolted against him should george w bush win it is useful to consider how different a world he and his foreign policy advisers would confront from the last time colin powell dick cheney condi rice and paul wolfowitz were in office with president bush eight years ago the book on governor bush is that while he does n't know much about the world his advisers who were all his father 's advisers are experts that is true but many are experts in a world that does n't exist anymore we do not have a cold war global system anymore we do n't have a cold war military and we do n't have a cold war public in short this ai n't your father 's foreign policy the players may be the same but the world is n't here are five things president bush could never have taught his son about the world 1 while america was certainly a superpower when president bush left office its economy was just coming out of stagnation and the soviet union had just collapsed today america is not just a superpower it 's a hyperpower with both unrivaled military might and an information economy that is the envy of the world what 's new in all this is that while other countries still call for us leadership they envy and resent america more than ever no one wants to be america 's enemy but few want to be perceived as its friend and what that means is that if mr bush tries out some of the more macho unilateralist policies talked about by his advisers such as abrogating the abm treaty or sponsoring an uprising in iraq he will face a ferocious reaction from us rivals and allies alike for instance because of us economic sanctions on iraq saddam hussein is now more popular than ever on the arab street indeed i am sorry to report a huge cheer would go up from the arab street today if iraq were to acquire nuclear weapons to counterbalance the us and israel 2 president bush had to manage the waxing military power of china the waning military power of the soviet union and the soaring economic power of japan what us foreign policy is about today is managing the weakness of china the weakness of russia and the weakness of japan as all three go through the wrenching internal adjustments to globalization that have made their possible collapse more threatening to us than their strength in the bush years us officials liked to say we lead japan pays now we must lead and pay 3 the internet did not exist as a foreign policy tool when president bush left office today it 's huge jody williams won the nobel peace prize for organizing a global ban on land mines against the wishes of the major powers using e mail if governor bush really did try to abrogate the abm treaty unilaterally and cram it down the throats of the russians and europeans i believe it could trigger a seattle like internet driven mass based anti nuclear protest against the us identical to the popular movement in europe today against america 's genetically modified foods this could make it impossible for any nato ally to cooperate with the us on missile defenses 4 america was a deficit country when president bush left office and now it is a surplus country that means that the republican ethos of steadily cutting back government and the foreign affairs budget is not only unnecessary it 's reckless and it will be perceived by the world as increasingly selfish indeed it 's easy for the bushies to sneer that they wo n't be the world 's 911 or global cops but such aloofness is much harder in practice now that america is so dominant as the clintonites discovered we are now held responsible for everything but americans do n't want to die for virtually anything so finding ways to make a sustainable difference in places such as kosovo or rwanda is a lot harder than uttering a sound bite 5 globalization the speed interconnectivity and economic impact of global markets today is much greater than eight years ago if mr bush does try a deep tax cut that the markets perceive as reckless their judgment on him will be nasty brutish and swift swifter than he may ever imagine other than that nothing 's changed
 the scandal over the sexual abuse of children by priests in boston and other american communities is a heartbreaking tragedy short of incest there is probably no sexual predator so damaging as a member of the clergy who chooses to betray young people 's trust instances of men of the cloth taking sexual advantage of children are by no means limited to massachusetts or to the roman catholic church but the current scandal in boston is exceptional both because of its scope and because of the determination with which the archdiocese 's authorities turned a blind eye a single priest john geoghan now defrocked has been accused of molesting more than 130 children over 30 years of service and was convicted recently in one case although the archdiocese was aware of numerous allegations against mr geoghan the priest continued to be transferred from parish to parish for decades often into jobs that put him in contact with children cardinal bernard law the venerable head of the boston archdiocese and the most senior leader of the catholic church in the united states has now moved to put in place a rigorous system for the identification evaluation and disposition of charges of sexual abuse by priests but cardinal law was far from proactive in dealing with the problem and he has rejected any suggestions that he step down noting that a bishop is not a corporate executive is not a politician catholics and non catholics alike have an interest in making sure that the church is watching for any illegal behavior among the priests it trains and employs they deserve some indication that the entire church power structure is responding with the utmost gravity to this issue cardinal law 's future is a matter for the cardinal and his superiors to handle but the voluntary retirement of so prominent a figure might be an appropriate way to demonstrate how seriously the church is taking this matter

 the supreme court brought relief to newsrooms across the country yesterday when it handed down an important first amendment decision in favor of freedom of the press the 6 to 3 ruling came in a tricky case that required the justices to weigh legitimate personal privacy concerns as addressed by an excessively broad federal wiretap law against the public 's right to know the case involved a tape recording of an illegally intercepted cell phone conversation between two teachers union officials the officials were discussing heated contract negotiations and there was a reference to blowing up the front porches of school board members the tape whose source is unknown made its way to local radio stations and newspapers which broadcast and published its contents there was no dispute that the tape was lawfully obtained by the media and that its contents were of public significance but its dissemination ran afoul of a 1968 wiretap law that prohibits the disclosure of illegally intercepted communications the union officials then sued but the court correctly saw that holding the press liable in this instance for the illegal conduct of its sources would have established a dangerous precedent and exercised a chilling effect on the media 's ability to report truthfully on significant matters of public concern a stranger 's illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the first amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern concluded justice john paul stevens while acknowledging the harm to people illegally taped however as it has in the past the court declined to bar all restrictions on publishing truthful information in addition a concurring opinion written by justice stephen breyer and joined by justice sandra day o'connor warned that privacy protections will generally prevail when illegally intercepted information passed on to a paper or broadcaster is purely personal and lacks high interest and importance to the public this cautionary language while potentially worrisome does not diminish the value of the decision faced with a choice between privacy claims and the media 's right to disseminate legally obtained information on matters of public importance the court sided with freedom of the press
 during the 2000 election many journalists deluded themselves and their audience into believing that there were n't many policy differences between the major candidates and focused on personalities or rather perceptions of personalities instead this time there can be no illusions president bush has turned this country sharply to the right and this election will determine whether the right 's takeover is complete but will the coverage of the election reflect its seriousness toward that end i hereby propose some rules for 2004 political reporting do n't talk about clothes al gore 's endorsement of howard dean was a momentous event the man who won the popular vote in 2000 threw his support to a candidate who accuses the president of wrongfully taking the nation to war so what did some prominent commentators write about why the fact that both men wore blue suits this was not alas unusual i do n't know why some journalists seem so concerned about politicians clothes as opposed to say their policy proposals but unless you 're a fashion reporter obsessing about clothes is an insult to your readers intelligence actually look at the candidates policy proposals one key proposal in the state of the union address will we hear be the creation of new types of tax exempt savings accounts the proposal will come wrapped in fine phrases about an ownership society but serious journalists should tell us how the plan would work who would benefit and who would lose an early version of the plan was floated almost a year ago and carefully analyzed in the journal tax notes so there 's no excuse for failing to report that the plan would probably reduce not increase national savings that it would have large long run budget costs and that its benefits would go mainly to the wealthiest few percent of the population beware of personal anecdotes anecdotes that supposedly reveal a candidate 's character are a staple of political reporting but they should carry warning labels for one thing there are lots of anecdotes and it 's much too easy to report only those that reinforce the reporter 's prejudices the approved story line about mr bush is that he 's a bluff honest plain spoken guy and anecdotes that fit that story get reported but if the conventional wisdom were instead that he 's a phony a silver spoon baby who pretends to be a cowboy journalists would have plenty of material to work with if a reporter must use anecdotes they 'd better be true after the dean endorsement innumerable reporters cracked jokes about al gore 's inventing the internet guys he never said that it 's a malicious distortion of a true statement and no self respecting journalist would repeat it look at the candidates records a close look at mr bush 's record as governor would have revealed that the approved story line notwithstanding he was no moderate a close look at mr dean 's record in vermont reveals that the emerging story line notwithstanding he is no radical he was a fiscally conservative leader whose biggest policy achievement nearly universal health insurance for children was the result of incremental steps do n't fall for political histrionics i could n't believe how much ink was spilled after the gore dean event over joe lieberman 's hurt feelings folks we 're talking about war peace and the future of us democracy not about who takes whom to the prom political operatives have become experts at manufacturing the appearance of outrage in the last few weeks the usual suspects have been trying to paint howard dean 's obviously heartfelt comments about his brother 's death in laos as some sort of insult to the military we owe it to our readers not to fall for these tricks it 's not about you we learn from the washington post that reporters covering mr dean are surprised and it 's implied miffed that he never asks a single question about them the mind reels i do n't really expect my journalistic colleagues to follow these rules no doubt i myself in moments of weakness will break one or more of them but history will not forgive us if we allow laziness and personal pettiness to shape this crucial election e mail krugman nytimescom

 to the editor dr jerome groopman op ed april 21 rightly says that people should be encouraged to get past the unhelpful and painful idea that they have caused their own disease the very fact that this type of idea is so common shows there is a reason for people 's thinking this way often the reason is to give a sense of being in control in a helpless situation feeling helpless is intolerable for most of us it is as if the sick person is saying at least i have some control in this situation even if it was only in the genesis of it simply saying to such people that is not a realistic way to think will not allow them to give up the faulty sense of control as a substitute they must be helped to come to terms with the real helplessness of the situation and helped to find more realistic ways to feel in charge of their lives philip herschenfeld md new york april 22 2000 the writer is a psychoanalyst

 dr martin luther king jr received the nobel peace prize at the age of 35 when most people are still struggling to find out who they are by the time of his assassination four years later he had played the starring role in a movement for racial justice that transformed the country and caused him to be spoken of in the same breath as figures like abraham lincoln thomas jefferson and mohandas gandhi what might dr king have done with 40 more years he might have returned to his church and lived out his days as a minister he might have taken a professorship at his beloved boston university where he earned a doctoral degree and deposited many of his personal papers he might even have run for congress to continue the civil rights campaign in which he had played a crucial role since his first days as a preacher during the montgomery bus boycott in 1955 one thing seems certain dr king would not have lent his name to a disney style amusement park like the one his son dexter once proposed building in the area surrounding the king center for nonviolent social change in atlanta that plan was shelved after the civil rights establishment cried foul but the king family has continued along a distressing path that has made it increasingly difficult for historians teachers and journalists to circulate dr king 's words and ideas while making his name image and voice readily available to commercial enterprises americans grieved with the kings when the great civil rights leader was slain the country continues to feel sympathy for a wife who lost a husband and children who grew up fatherless but dr king 's admirers were understandably shocked upon hearing a piece of his immortal i have a dream speech free at last free at last sandwiched between the voices of homer simpson and kermit the frog in a tv commercial for a cellular phone company another advertisement by the french communications business alcatel manipulates footage of the 1963 march on washington so that the crowd that had gathered to listen to the i have a dream speech disappears from the scene leaving dr king preaching to a vacant washington mall the king estate started down this road 20 years ago in what seemed like a reasonable attempt to control martin luther king jr 's image so that it would be used only in authorized and appropriately dignified ways somewhere along the way the family became more interested in profit than dignity instead of protecting dr king against commercialization it began suing or dunning people who use his best known words and ideas in scholarly or journalistic enterprises one of the first targets was the distinguished documentarian henry hampton who featured dr king to noble effect in his landmark film eyes on the prize the family wanted money and the right to dictate how dr king 's likeness was used eventually mr hampton filed a lawsuit arguing that the family 's threats and demands for exorbitant payments had a chilling effect on free speech the suit was settled out of court the family has been relentless in its attempts to corner the market on dr king 's words historians all over the country were frightened when the king family sued boston university in an attempt to get it to return 85000 documents that he had deposited in the university archives during the 1960 's the most depressing example of misplaced values occurred recently when the king national memorial project foundation a not for profit organization began raising money for a 100 million memorial that is planned for the mall in washington its backers hope to place a memorial to dr king between those of lincoln and jefferson celebrating the role the civil rights leader played in realizing the democratic ideals that were first enunciated by the founding fathers and moved forward by lincoln in the emancipation proclamation the plans for this memorial which would be the first to honor a black american on the mall have been complicated by the king family 's failure to grant what it is calling a permissions agreement to the memorial foundation the king center in atlanta has issued a statement expressing concern that corporate sponsors of the memorial drive might try to connect their products with dr king in some untasteful way but the possibility that a corporate sponsor might degrade the march on washington and dr king 's i have a dream speech as much as his family has seems remote indeed money seems to be a more central concern the king center 's managing director tricia harris suggested to the washington post that the center was seeking a fee from the memorial foundation in order to offset money that the center might lose as a result of the memorial foundation 's fund raising the news of the dispute between the kings and the memorial foundation has already spawned hesitation among potential donors americans who love dr king and value his contribution to the national history have been appalled for years at the way the king center has placed profits above the national good with respect to martin luther king 's legacy dr king did not live long enough to provide as well for the family he left behind as he would have wished but his words his voice and his story belong to history not only to his family the possibility that the family might regard this heritage in terms of dollars and cents alone is just heartbreaking it cuts against everything that dr king tried to teach us

 with the blitzlike speed of his generals president bush has come out fighting for his disastrous plan for more upper bracket tax cuts which will only stoke the nation 's record levels of deficit spending and deepening debt well beyond his incumbency in a rose garden plea for his economic growth package yesterday mr bush artfully adapted his war room posture to link applause lines for the iraqi success thus far with fresh appeals to rally behind a new battle against the dividends tax the president made a political couplet of the two themes of patriotism and tax cuts in trumpeting his resolve to cash in his personally high poll ratings from the war for a tax cut that most americans are wary of unlike mr bush they seem to be aware that continuous tax reductions at a time of heavy wartime expenses are going to reduce the chances of creating much desired programs like prescription drug coverage for the elderly or financing for the education initiatives that the president once seemed to think were so important now mr bush is asking for more please including at least the 550 billion 10 year cut pending in congress it is incredible to see a wartime president demanding a tax cut that would in an instant require a record 984 billion increase in the national debt to 7384 trillion with annual deficits of 400 billion and more under a republican party that once bragged of budgetary rectitude the president 's new full court press for tax cuts is scheduled to include dozens of bush surrogates fanning out across the country while congress is in recess to argue his case their main target is a few principled senate republicans who have joined with democrats to demand that the tax cut be limited to 350 billion that is hardly a bargain for taxpayers who will still be saddled with bigger deficits debt and program shrinkage as future bills and borrowing come due still the resistance of the gop dissenters is not acceptable in mr bush 's renewed detaxation mania and those republicans must stand fast against selling out as the white house sends a platoon of emissaries to the states to lobby for the maximum cut unlike his father president bush is leaving no gap in turning back to the troubled economy a day after the pentagon began pronouncing the war over political attention is one thing fiscal wisdom another the rose garden was filled with small business executives but not mainline economists like alan greenspan they are warning that the republicans doctrine of extended deficit spending and tax cuts will crimp the economy and interest rates in a grim future in which the government must borrow more and more to stay afloat

 lies arrogance betrayal so reads fortune 's current cover under the headline the enron disaster sounds good to me but fortune may have overlooked one force for evil trendy management theories in part this was a case of death by guru enron sold lots of things but above all it sold itself it crafted a self portrait that business gurus loved like a schematic diagram from the mckinsey quarterly or the harvard business review enron 's business plan made a perfect powerpoint presentation other companies hired business gurus as consultants enron in effect put the gurus in charge jeff skilling who made enron what it is today is a former mckinsey consultant what they created was a company so trendy that investors were dazzled and that let executives get away with financial murder are trendy management theories really that important a look at the business best seller lists might suggest not it might even suggest that the management guru business is not what it was five or six years ago in a bull market readers wanted advice on investment not on how to re engineer the search for excellence in the total quality chaos it has been a while since that giddy moment when both jesus ceo and make it so management lessons from star trek the next generation were riding high in the charts but the real impact of the guru business and the real money has always come via consulting rather than book sales while consultants may not have sold as many books in the late 1990 's as they did in earlier years the influence of trendy business doctrines probably increased as the millennium approached why because in a bubble economy investors were n't interested in hard facts they flocked to the companies that told the best stories and this created tremendous pressure on managers to conform with the latest trend corporations became intellectual fashion victims which brings us back to enron from 1997 to 2000 the years when enron stock rose from 20 to 90 business gurus disdained old fashioned companies whose valuation had something to do with hard assets the usefulness of asset based strategies is waning declared one article in the mckinsey quarterly the future belonged to companies with no visible means of support i 'm not just talking about dot coms gurus also celebrated such new age business heroes as petropreneurs who owned neither oil wells nor refineries and fabless chip companies that owned no factories flexibility and vision were what counted not bricks mortar and tubular steel and enron was absolutely fabless it prided itself on being an asset light company ok it owned some pipelines but what it really offered was the vision thing it would create markets in everything and make money by trading in those markets and if you could n't understand why enron 's trading operation was as profitable as it seemed to be that was because you just did n't get it this sort of circular logic if you do n't believe that 's because there 's something wrong with you is typical of extreme religious and political sects well what 's a guru without a cult admittedly there is a chicken or enron question was enron so admired because it embodied faddish management ideas so perfectly or did those ideas become so faddish because of enron 's apparent success probably both the point is that the stock market rewarded enron for following such a fashionable business strategy and few analysts were willing to fly in the face of fashion by questioning enron 's numbers enron executives had every incentive to turn the company into a caricature of itself a giant hedge fund sitting on top of a pipeline as one critic said and the power that came with fashionability shielded the company from awkward questions about its accounts in the end of course reality bit enron is in bankruptcy its stock closed yesterday at 57 cents you can say this for the business world because there is a bottom line ultimately the truth will out no matter how plausible a business leader sounds if his numbers do n't add up if he promises more than he can possibly deliver the facts will eventually catch up with him it 's just too bad that the false business prophets who ran enron will probably get off lightly while the people who trusted them especially the ordinary employees will pay a heavy price

 the supreme court performs a valuable if sometimes under appreciated public service when it rises above politics and popular opinion to prevent harmful erosion of the first amendment 's wall between church and state yesterday the court admirably fulfilled that mission in refusing to permit organized student led prayers before public high school football games the 6 to 3 ruling the court 's most important school prayer decision in almost a decade came in a closely watched case from texas it arose when a mormon family and a catholic family brought a lawsuit objecting to the christian prayers offered by chaplains at school events trying to get around the constitutional bar on officially organized prayers the district shifted it policies to have a student selected by a schoolwide election deliver a pregame message or invocation of his or her own choosing for the majority this resort to a student surrogate could not hide the school 's role in organizing the religious worship nor could it overcome the intrinsic risk of coercion in holding prayer exercises in elementary and secondary schools whether during regular class hours or at after school events the 'degree of school involvement makes it clear that the pregame prayers bear 'the imprint of the state and thus put school age children who objected in an untenable position wrote justice john paul stevens quoting language the court used eight years ago in its ruling outlawing clergy led prayer at graduation gov george w bush who filed a brief supporting the pregame prayers expressed disappointment yesterday with the decision so did three members of the court chief justice william rehnquist and justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas whose dissent described the majority opinion as bristling with hostility to all things religious in public life chief justice rehnquist should know better than to confuse the majority 's attempt to protect against state establishment of religion with opposition to religion generally the court as justice stevens wrote recognizes the important role that public worship plays in many communities the new ruling merely upholds the principle that religious activity in public schools as elsewhere must comport with the first amendment

 to the editor re strain of fourth grade tests drives off veteran teachers front page june 14 i became a teacher to inspire the creativity in my students and promote the development of lifelong learners i also encourage my students to be individual thinkers and focus on process over product there may be only one answer sometimes but it is the process of getting to a goal whether correct or not that is the most important i feel that these tests are damaging to the theme of process over product it seems that the product or test scores are now more important than the way children use their thinking skills or creativity good teachers can not follow a script the only script in the classroom is what energizes students and turns them on to learning the more pressure placed on a teacher to produce a perfect product or test score the fewer creative process oriented teachers you will have and the even fewer creative thinkers as students what will become of lifelong learners tova markowitz lynbrook ny june 14 2001
 to the editor michael s mcpherson and morton owen schapiro a sensible tax on fortunes op ed march 22 paint with too broad a brush when they say too little is said about the potential discouragement to enterprise and ambition for those who start life with the assurance of great wealth does that address the many rockefellers and kennedys who entered public service and there are thousands of children of the millionaire next door who go off and do their own thing it may be true that wealth in fact encourages enterprise because a safety net exists the writers also propose that to avoid breaking up family farms or businesses the owner could divide ownership among family members this is naive to introduce family dynamics rivalries and pressures into a business can put that business out of business quickly eric mihan oxford md march 22 2001

 why do n't people vote their own self interest every few years the republicans propose a tax cut and every few years the democrats pull out their income distribution charts to show that much of the benefits of the republican plan go to the richest 1 percent of americans or thereabouts and yet every few years a republican plan wends its way through the legislative process and with some trims and amendments passes the democrats could n't even persuade people to oppose the repeal of the estate tax which is explicitly for the mega upper class al gore who ran a populist campaign could n't even win the votes of white males who did n't go to college whose incomes have stagnated over the past decades and who were the explicit targets of his campaign why do n't more americans want to distribute more wealth down to people like themselves well as the academics would say it 's overdetermined there are several reasons people vote their aspirations the most telling polling result from the 2000 election was from a time magazine survey that asked people if they are in the top 1 percent of earners nineteen percent of americans say they are in the richest 1 percent and a further 20 percent expect to be someday so right away you have 39 percent of americans who thought that when mr gore savaged a plan that favored the top 1 percent he was taking a direct shot at them it 's not hard to see why they think this way americans live in a culture of abundance they have always had a sense that great opportunities lie just over the horizon in the next valley with the next job or the next big thing none of us is really poor we 're just pre rich americans read magazines for people more affluent than they are w cigar aficionado the new yorker robb report town and country because they think that someday they could be that guy with the tastefully appointed horse farm democratic politicians proposing to take from the rich are just bashing the dreams of our imminent selves income resentment is not a strong emotion in much of america if you earn 125000 a year and live in manhattan certainly you are surrounded by things you can not afford you have to walk by those buildings on central park west with the 2500 square foot apartments that are empty three quarters of the year because their evil owners are mostly living at their other houses in la but if you are a middle class person in most of america you are not brought into incessant contact with things you ca n't afford there are n't lexus dealerships on every corner there are no snooty restaurants with water sommeliers to help you sort though the bottled eau selections you can afford most of the things at wal mart or kohl 's and the occasional meal at the macaroni grill moreover it would be socially unacceptable for you to pull up to church in a jaguar or to hire a caterer for your dinner party anyway so you are not plagued by a nagging feeling of doing without many americans admire the rich they do n't see society as a conflict zone between the rich and poor it 's taboo to say in a democratic culture but do you think a nation that watches katie couric in the morning tom hanks in the evening and michael jordan on weekends harbors deep animosity toward the affluent on the contrary i 'm writing this from nashville where one of the richest families the frists is hugely admired for its entrepreneurial skill and community service people do n't want to tax the frists they want to elect them to the senate and they did nor are americans suffering from false consciousness you go to a town where the factories have closed and people who once earned 14 an hour now work for 8 an hour they 've taken their hits but odds are you will find their faith in hard work and self reliance undiminished and their suspicion of washington unchanged americans resent social inequality more than income inequality as the sociologist jennifer lopez has observed do n't be fooled by the rocks that i got i 'm just i 'm just jenny from the block as long as rich people stay real in ms lopez 's formulation they are admired meanwhile middle class journalists and academics who seem to look down on megachurches suburbia and hunters are resented if americans see the tax debate as being waged between the economic elite led by president bush and the cultural elite led by barbra streisand they are going to side with mr bush who could come to any suburban barbershop and fit right in most americans do not have marxian categories in their heads this is the most important reason americans resist wealth redistribution the reason that subsumes all others americans do not see society as a layer cake with the rich on top the middle class beneath them and the working class and underclass at the bottom they see society as a high school cafeteria with their community at one table and other communities at other tables they are pretty sure that their community is the nicest and filled with the best people and they have a vague pity for all those poor souls who live in new york city or california and have a lot of money but no true neighbors and no free time all of this adds up to a terrain incredibly inhospitable to class based politics every few years a group of millionaire democratic presidential aspirants pretends to be the people 's warriors against the overclass they look inauthentic combative rather than unifying worst of all their basic message is not optimistic they have n't learned what franklin and teddy roosevelt and even bill clinton knew that you can run against rich people but only those who have betrayed the ideal of fair competition you have to be more hopeful and growth oriented than your opponent and you can not imply that we are a nation tragically and permanently divided by income in the gospel of america there are no permanent conflicts david brooks a senior editor at the weekly standard is author of bobos in paradise the new upper

 in august 1962 the national observer newspaper carried a report from south america with the headline democracy dies in peru but few seem to mourn its passing the story described the indifference of peruvians to a military coup that had just installed a junta in power the young reporter was hunter thompson who later became famous for a different style of journalism as for peru much the same article could be published today democracy swells and recedes in latin america in recent decades the trend was favorable military rulers fell leaving cuba as the only outright dictatorship but as in the 1960 's and early 1970 's democratic rule is now being nibbled away in several countries among them peru the threat today is not from classic military dictatorship but more subtle forms of autocracy often endorsed by a public angry at the corruption and ineptitude of its democratic political system in peru president alberto fujimori will stand for a third term in april he could do so only after sacking judges who ruled that a third term was unconstitutional and he has rigged the campaign in his favor in ecuador last month soldiers claiming to represent ordinary citizens against the political elite toppled the president and installed the vice president in venezuela voters have granted sweeping powers to president hugo chavez an army colonel who in 1992 attempted a military coup the history of democracy in latin america is one of advances and setbacks in 1960 for example virtually every nation in south america had an elected civilian leader by 1976 all but a few countries in central and south america were dictatorships the climate for democracy in latin america today is in many ways the best it has ever been largely due to the end of the cold war washington is no longer helping to overthrow elected left wing governments the end of the cold war has also led to the abandonment of armed struggle by marxist guerrillas in el salvador guatemala and other nations peace is good for democracy in those two countries it has allowed civilians to assert greater control over the military and peace agreements have helped make shallow democracies deeper and more inclusive latin american nations are under political and economic pressure including from one another to keep the dictators out in chile for example when the nation 's civilian leaders have attempted to prosecute military officers for pinochet era offenses soldiers have responded with shows of insubordination but this has not led chile 's upper class the military 's traditional backer to call for a coup in part because chile 's wealthy fear a reaction from the country 's trading partners but the world is not as willing to focus critical attention on political systems that fall short of outright dictatorship more important voters will grant their leaders autocratic powers when they do not believe democracy has helped them democratic governments are currently unable to contain a crime wave in several nations that is persuading some latin americans to support undemocratic measures or strongman rule as has often been the case people in venezuela ecuador and peru have turned against the traditional party system because they see it as protecting the privileged globalization has increased inequality in much of latin america and made the poor feel more neglected dictatorship is no solution alongside their brutality the continent 's strongmen have brought even more theft and mismanagement which is usually why they have fallen although gen augusto pinochet gained worldwide praise for his economic reforms in chile he is an exception among latin dictators once in office autocratic presidents can use their powers to grab far more than the usual advantages of incumbency peru used to have relatively clean elections but few believe that mr fujimori 's electoral test in april will be a fair one he has shut down virtually all critical television news and effectively controls the agencies that will oversee the election opposition politicians have been harassed their campaign events are often sabotaged and their paid commercials have been rejected by lima 's television networks elected autocrats like mr fujimori deserve scrutiny just as outright dictators do while the clinton administration has been a consistent critic of rights violations in peru it must speak out more forcefully on flaws in the upcoming election the most important lesson from the past however is for latin america 's democrats if they can not control corruption and make government work for the poor they risk not only their hold on power but democracy itself
 any mention of the new international criminal court in washington these days seems to guarantee an ugly overreaction the bush administration and congress have rushed to outdo each other in bullying the 77 countries that have already agreed to take part in the court including some of america 's closest allies forgotten in this frenzy is the court 's desirable goal of bringing international war criminals to justice and its substantial protections against abusive prosecutions ignoring these realities washington prefers to brandish its military and economic power to coerce other countries into exempting all americans in advance from the court 's jurisdiction in the latest gambit the state department last week warned countries participating in the court that they could be denied united states military assistance unless they sign agreements shielding american personnel from the court 's authority this threat written into the latest big antiterrorism spending bill by tom delay the house majority whip does not apply to nato members and several other close allies and mr bush has the power to waive it entirely regrettably he has n't the same legislation grants the white house permission to use all means including military force to free americans held under the court 's authority this page shares washington 's desire that no innocent american peacekeeper aid worker or diplomat get caught up in a politically motivated international prosecution but that is already assured by treaty provisions that limit the court 's jurisdiction to war crimes genocide and crimes against humanity and let it proceed only when national courts fail to prosecute the court is designed to ensure that a future slobodan milosevic saddam hussein or muammar el qaddafi can not evade justice by manipulating his country 's legal system it is not designed to frame americans on trumped up charges washington gains nothing by antagonizing longstanding allies the reasonable american policy would be to join the court and help it achieve its purposes which square with longstanding american goals as well though that will not happen soon at the very least the administration and congress should respect the sovereign right of other countries to join the court without being subjected to american pressure

 the editorial board of the new york times has the same problem i do the candidate whose domestic policy we favor is not the one with the worldview we prefer what troubles the times about al gore 's tough minded weltanschauung is just what draws me to the democrat with perverse consistency what appeals to the times about george bush 's reluctance to intervene worries me about the republican take the balkans as henny youngman would have added please gore frowned the times yesterday argued for a more muscular projection of american influence including military intervention in overseas trouble spots he described himself as a 'hard liner in favor of action during debates over the balkans as the house hawk i see that as the vice president 's finest hour mr gore in trying to draw distinctions between himself and the less experienced governor continued my distressed confreres about the second debate outlined a more aggressive response to america 's role as the sole superpower though crediting him for being on the right track for trying to deal with genocidal conflict the times complained that he offered no assurances on what limits he might place on such involvements defining such limits is the essence of presidential leadership that 's what i like most about gore he confidently asserts his assumption of superpower responsibility he offers no self defeating promises about exit strategies and makes no apologies for taking action to save lives protect human values and turn back totalitarians marshaling public support for needed sacrifice is in my book the job of a leader and what of george w whose tax plan decentralization approach and retirement reforms i embrace as a page that has generally been reluctant to endorse military intervention says the editorial of the newspaper i revere especially for inventing the op ed page we like mr bush 's cautious attitude it likes his position that any foreign involvement must be based on a strict definition of vital national interest those qualifiers strict and vital strike me as words used often to excuse or justify inaction bush 's most impressive moment in the campaign came when he parted company from impatient republicans in congress who using such severe sounding weasel words wanted to exit strategize our troops out of the balkans before our intervention helped the serbian people free themselves it 's undeniable though that bush whose foreign experience is second hand is using the language of caution this is designed to persuade voters that his inexperience would not lead him to reckless action bush 's rhetoric of restraint is supposed to insulate him from the charges of that damned cowboy leveled first by mark hanna against teddy roosevelt and by others at ronald reagan he knows that humility in hegemony becomes a leader of a superpower respect for local opinion beats arrogance and bombast but in the face of genocide as in the balkans or against germ warheads on missiles from iraq a president should construe vital interest not strictly but broadly like recklessness misplaced caution can cost a lot of lives having pushed the presidential campaign aside in the headlines the worry of war will intrude itself into tomorrow 's debate suddenly we are made to realize that it 's the world stupid that we are to choose not only among rival prescription drug entitlements but also between differing approaches to the use of force should clinton his diplomacy too soon made glad junket to north korea for a legacy photo op should we expand nato to include democratic baltic nations vulnerable to putin 's russia should we affirm our tilt toward israel now that our broker posture is treated with arab contempt were general intelligence warnings that spooked the white house into acquiescing in the un excoriation of israel not transmitted to our naval vessel in yemen awakened voters want to know when do national interests become vital what action would you take to defend them does a defense against missiles now seem more urgent on this i 'm rooting for bush to be more like gore unless of course gore tries to be more like bush
 the clinton administration released projections last week showing that the estimated federal surplus will hit 5 trillion over the next 10 years almost 1 trillion more than previously expected supporters of president elect george w bush say that the bigger surplus now expected will provide the wherewithal to pass mr bush 's proposed 19 trillion tax cut which the bush team believes is needed to spur an economy that is slowing down but a careful look at the numbers shows that the bush plan remains a bad fiscal idea start with the fact that 25 trillion of the projected surplus comes from social security and another 500 billion or so comes from medicare both pots of money are essentially off limits congress appears committed to using the extra money from these programs to pay down the federal debt a use that does not affect the solvency of either program but does improve the overall health of the future economy so that leaves only about 2 trillion of the projected 5 trillion surplus for tax cuts and new government spending but fiscal matters are not nearly as rosy as the new estimates suggest the white house projections assume that federal programs other than social security medicare and medicaid will not expand over the next decade that is unrealistic the cost of making likely additions to defense capabilities and to some domestic programs and of preserving popular tax credits that are scheduled to expire would eat up an additional 600 billion or more out of the surplus that would leave only 14 trillion available for tax cuts and all other spending increases mr bush 's overly generous tax cut plan would wipe out virtually the entire remaining surplus that would leave him no money to help as he has promised low income families buy health insurance which could cost 600 billion over 10 years or to add prescription drugs to medicare which could cost 200 billion over 10 years beyond fiscal feasibility supporters of mr bush argue that a big tax cut is needed to spur an economy that they say may be flirting with recession this argument too is weak tax policy is rarely used to offset the ups and downs of a modern economy because it is too hard to time the impact of a tax cut congress would probably not pass a major tax cut bill until the fall and consumers would likely not respond for many months thereafter it could be well more than a year before any significant increase in consumer spending kicked in and by that time the economic slowdown the tax cut sought to reverse might already be long past most economists look to monetary policy which can be changed rapidly and often by the federal reserve to keep the economy on an even keel the bush plan is the wrong economic elixir but a smaller targeted tax cut could indeed make sense rather than awarding the bulk of tax cuts to the wealthy as the bush plan would do the better idea is to focus tax cuts on low income families those whose earnings have slipped during most of the last 30 years congress could provide a tax credit to offset the cost of health insurance for example it could use tax credits to offset the impact of payroll taxes which hit poor families proportionately harder than wealthy families modest tax cuts targeted in this way would make a fine use of any unclaimed federal revenues

 with its heated rhetoric and threats of retaliation the trans atlantic fight over president bush 's decision to raise tariffs against imported steel may look like just another trade dispute but pascal lamy trade commissioner for the european union is using the steel spat to make the eu the new rule maker for international trade his effort marks a role reversal of historic proportions in world politics fifty years ago there was a country that when it came to international trade put the welfare of the world economy ahead of its own that country was the leading economic power of its day and its ideas about economics and finance determined the direction global policy would take it was of course the united states the united states is still the world 's leading economic power but what happens when the hegemon 's chief loses sight of the global picture and becomes distracted by internal matters like securing the votes of steel states someone else with different ideas on how the global economy should be organized might fill the vacuum mr lamy one of europe 's most strategy minded politicians is hoping to do just that the europeans are taking great care to play by the rules in the steel dispute the eu is keen to ensure that even stiff european retaliation is fully justified under world trade organization rules it hopes that american action by contrast looks as much as possible like a temper tantrum not that the europeans are above street level politics the eu has already prepared an attack plan in the form of a carefully chosen set of countervailing tariffs covering 316 products from motorcycles to orange juice worth more than 2 billion designed with the american electoral map in mind if as many people believe president bush adopted the steel tariff in large part to secure steel state votes in 2004 the europeans are ready to try to show that the steel tariff can also result in lost votes in states where people are hurt by europe 's targeted retaliation the eu plan will not go into effect until other tactics have failed in particular anti tariff cases brought before the wto by the eu and others against the united states but mr lamy has his plan ready just in case clearly mr lamy is hoping that one way or another the administration will find that the steel tariffs are all pain and no gain if it does so he will be ready with an ingenious and very european proposal that would go far beyond safeguarding metal working jobs mr lamy well knows that trade discussions can rapidly get bogged down in detailed discussions that while they may provide arcane entertainment for industry experts leave little room for sweeping strategy he is interested however in leveraging the steel quarrel into a different kind of opportunity as can be glimpsed in a letter he sent to his american counterpart robert zoellick in mid february as mr lamy notes in his letter the root problem is the global overcapacity of steel production and resulting stiff competition president bush is raising tariffs to shield the american industry temporarily from competitive pressures so that it can restructure the big steel companies face heavy legacy costs promises of pension and health care payments in his letter to mr zoellick mr lamy proposes a fund that could meet legacy costs associated with the definitive closure of production facilities help steel workers retrain and promote economic development in regions where steel plants were cutting capacity or closing this fund mr lamy noted could be financed by a 2 percent levy on steel sold in the united states whether domestic or imported mr lamy emphasized that europe wants to assist the american steel industry in restructuring to avoid collapse but at the same time europe wants the steel tariff removed american acceptance of this approach would show that there are other ways for government to affect industrial policy beyond throwing up occasional tariffs most experts agree that the american steel tariff probably violated wto rules the bush administration is already facing a high profile loss in the wto 's decision that corporate tax breaks for american exporters were against the rules it is now up to congress to adjust the tax code to pass muster with the wto and thereby avoid sanctions another loss would be embarrassing for a country that has placed the doha round of trade negotiations at the center of its international economic policy more important american actions seem to betray america 's free trade legacy in the formative years of the general agreement on tariffs and trade precursor to the wto the united states was willing to make significant sacrifices to strengthen the free trade system but the united states was also the rule maker because the system was after all its creation the europeans on the other hand were the source of major violations and tensions in the system now the tables are turned europe is far from being the poster boy of international trade as witnessed by its attempts to keep out latin american bananas a few years ago but what is different now is that the united states is willing to be a violator of trade rules and that europe is willing to seize the opportunity to become rule maker itself how europe by the way it frames its complaints to the wto will get to structure the nature of the case that in turn will play a huge role in determining the nature of the implementing rules in an area like world trade where much of the case law remains to be determined this amounts to substantial power in the weeks to come it is important to remember that the bottom line for mr lamy and the eu is not steel it is nothing less than wresting the leadership of world economic regulation from the united states american violations of wto rules are the route by which europeans can assert their interpretation of those rules by playing the good global citizen europe aims to become the world 's pacesetter that is one goal that all the 15 eu countries can agree on stephan richter is publisher of the globalist a daily online magazine about the global economy

 george w bush is advocating radical change in social security which he himself calls the single most successful government program in american history he would take a part of the payroll tax that now flows to the social security trust fund and divert it to personal savings accounts but doing so would seriously undermine the finances of the present social security system it would subject americans especially financially unsophisticated ones to large additional risks and it would abandon the noble commitment to social insurance that this country made in 1935 while social security is a great success its current large surplus masks a serious long term financing problem simply put we have promised far more in future benefits than future payroll tax receipts are likely to finance about 14 percent more on average over the next 75 years according to the social security trustees estimates this is a huge hole that must be filled by some combination of raising payroll taxes cutting benefits and infusing general revenue into the trust fund with the system in need of more revenue not less diverting part of the payroll tax into private accounts as mr bush proposes appears irresponsible unless of course you make up the difference by cutting benefits without such cuts privatization would dig the financing hole even deeper which is why thoughtful privatization proposals generally include significant tax increases to make good on promises that have already been made but mr bush has not proposed any this is no minor omission diverting 2 percentage points of the payroll tax into individual accounts would drain trillions of dollars from social security over the next quarter century and that 's just the beginning the bush plan not only would imperil social security 's finances but would add new elements of cost and risk to the retirement security of millions of americans privatization is superficially attractive for two main reasons the higher returns that can presumably be earned say in the stock market and the virtues of individual choice that 's all well and good for financially sophisticated americans who happen by no coincidence also to enjoy every other advantage in our society and who by the way do not rely heavily on social security for their retirement income but what about the less fortunate citizens the ones who will need to live on their social security checks but who may not know the difference between a stock and a bond is freedom of choice such a blessing for them will they understand the risks to which they may be exposed when funds are invested in stocks and held to retirement the accumulated balance at retirement is as volatile as the stock market which not so infrequently moves up or down by 50 percent or more within a few years it is a cruel illusion to pretend that small individual accounts will enjoy the full returns that people see in the stock market there are commissions and even more important management fees that can easily exceed 1 percent of assets per year then when they retire people will discover that buying an individual as opposed to a group annuity eats up another chunk of the money whereas social security offers annuities automatically and at zero cost furthermore social security 's annuities are protected from inflation whereas private ones are not finally let 's remember the central idea behind the social security system to provide social insurance both words matter high wage earners like me would undoubtedly be better off under the bush proposal and even better off under full privatization after all universal social insurance forces us to remain in the same pool with and partially subsidize those who are less fortunate social security 's benefit formula offers a better rate of return to lower wage individuals from a self interested point of view that 's a bad deal for us high income people were vanguard or fidelity to offer me a mutual fund like that i would n't buy any but people like me can not opt out of social security and frankly i do n't want to universal social insurance is one of those precious ties that bind our society together privatization whether partial or total would weaken that tie alan s blinder a professor of economics at princeton and visiting fellow at the brookings institution is an adviser to the gore campaign

 president bush tried to fix the economy before lunch yesterday he managed to last for 20 minutes each in four economic seminars at baylor university he dutifully scribbled some notes as participants talked looking as happy as a high school kid in trig class and bounded out of his chair when treasury secretary paul o'neill told him he could be excused yes well a visibly relieved mr bush said jumping up after an exhausting 18 minutes in economic recovery and job creation that 's the life of the president always has to go or as the radical economist groucho marx once observed hello i must be going the seminars lasted only an hour and a half but mr bush and dick cheney divided the eight so as not to overly tax themselves by the final session mr bush was staring into space finding the talk of stimulus unstimulating as the president told one group i can assure that even though i wo n't be sitting through every single moment of the seminars nor will the vice president we will look at the summaries the cliffsnotes presidency before wrapping up with chicken salad key lime pie and stars and stripes forever the president did some cheerleading even though times are kind of tough right now mr bush drawled we 're america as usual when the president talks up the economy the dow dived under the bed dropping 206 points he thanked all the good folks for putting on a great show like his dad w reads his stage directions it was a message i care pr pageant so why not just say so his father accused of being out of touch on the economy got in trouble for checking his watch twice during a debate with bill clinton that 's why w did n't even wear a watch while debating al gore but perhaps because of his short attention span the younger bush always gives the impression of checking his watch although it seemed that mr bush wanted to go deeper into his job after 9 11 he 's still riding the surface treating photo ops like real events and passing off fortune cookie comments as policy pronouncements this president 's speed dial economic summit was an interesting contrast with the last president 's preening cult of personality economic summit a decade ago mr bush as always seemed to be trying to get through the morning without saying anything that would expose him as empty headed he has a pathological fear of talking bill clinton has a pathological fear of not talking he held a talkathon in little rock before he started his presidency also for self serving pr reasons while mr clinton wanted to convey concern about the economy he inherited from bush pere he mostly wanted to show off his wonkishness putting on the glasses he had rarely worn during the campaign the smartest kid in the class dominated the room for two long days without yawning once the vice president dragged back from fishing in wyoming to scurry around the waco sessions with mr bush was caught on camera stifling yawns twice while mr clinton designed his summit to show that democrats could be cozy with big business mr bush designed his summit to show that he is not too cozy with big business at one of his drop bys yesterday mr bush admitted to longing to see a few corporate malefactors in handcuffs and white house planners were careful to scatter token blue collar folks among the customary blue chip folks the bush family used to sit outside the clinton white house stewing that bill had besmirched the honor of the oval office that they held dear now the clinton family sits outside the bush white house stewing that w has besmirched the spectacular but somewhat artificial boom they held dear the clintons would love to see president bush lately of harken energy endure his own equivalent of kenneth starr the scandalous condition of american capitalism has even provided hillary clinton with the political opening she needed by insisting that the average american 's financial well being was better in clinton times than bush times she is breaking ground for her presidential campaign in 2008 if she can wait that long e mail liberties nytimescom

 gasoline prices hover around 2 a gallon in parts of the united states and threaten to rise to similar levels in many other regions consumers are upset and there is no easy solution to the problem congressional republicans thought for a time that they had a deft answer in going after what they called the gore tax the 43 cents per gallon that a democrat controlled congress tacked onto the federal gas tax in 1993 but this week republican leaders abandoned that frivolous idea if it were effective reducing taxes on gasoline would only encourage americans to buy more foreign oil at the same time that saudi arabia and other oil producers have tripled their price but the tax cut would mostly benefit oil companies which could raise prices to offset it rather than consumers congress does have a partial remedy at hand lying in salt domes in louisiana and texas are about 600 million barrels of oil this strategic petroleum reserve was created to handle genuine oil crises not the run up in home heating oil prices in new england last month and in gasoline prices this month but there is a policy called swaps that would provide some relief without compromising the use of the reserve for a future crisis the idea is to invite oil companies to remove oil today from the reserve expanding the supply and easing prices somewhat in exchange for returning an even larger amount of oil in the future swaps would knock only about a nickel off the price of gasoline according to one estimate the simple fact is that americans will gain substantially lower prices for gasoline only if oil exporters decide to increase production by a substantial amount the exporters will meet later this month and discuss raising production by about one to two million barrels a day that could cut gas prices by up to 75 cents a gallon americans can also weaken the impact of high oil prices no matter what the future levels by cutting back consumption yet foreign oil exports will continue to dominate america 's energy picture and will operate largely independent of what americans do

 since the vietnam war the american defense debate could be characterized as republicans wanting more of the same tanks ships and planes and democrats wanting less there were some important differences between the parties over questions of intervention and strategy peacekeeping and war fighting but when it came to military programs and hardware the political divide was simply a matter of scale george w bush when he was still texas governor tried to change all that in a september 1999 speech calling for a revolution at the pentagon it was a speech that said quite simply we do n't need more or less of the same defense we need a very different defense but now george w bush 's plan to transform the military is coming back to haunt the pentagon and in particular defense secretary donald rumsfeld as a candidate mr bush proposed the biggest changes in our military forces since the 1930 's strategic and bureaucratic initiatives meant to move the pentagon away from an industrial age outgrowth of our world war ii and cold war forces those magnificent tanks ships and planes and toward a leaner longer range and more precise force intended to deter and combat the threats of the future this transformed military would use advances in computing and information technology to pack more punch than today 's forces do but in very different form large and slow moving aircraft carriers would give way to submarines and other stealthier ships that would deliver much more than a carrier 's worth of precision guided munitions f 22 aircraft meant for dogfights would give way to long range bombers and to unmanned aircraft not limited by a human being in the cockpit large and cumbersome army divisions full of tanks and artillery would give way to smaller lighter more lethal and more agile formations all this force would be stitched together by real time space based information systems and applied in new ways the military knows this change is coming its own planning documents and vision statements all refer explicitly to these changes in warfare but putting the vision into action means short term pain and wrenching change neither of which the pentagon handles well moreover the congressional budget office estimates that even with dramatically increased defense spending the pentagon will over the next decade still be unable to afford sustaining and improving the cold war force now mr rumsfeld is backed into a corner the political and economic bill for trying to bring this agenda to fruition has come due if mr rumsfeld legitimizes the pentagon 's status quo responses more tanks ships and planes slightly improved to his proposals he undermines mr bush and keeps the pentagon in a spiral of steadily deteriorating readiness rapidly rising equipment replacement costs and increasing strategic irrelevance if he pushes the president 's agenda forward he faces the iron triangle of congress the uniformed chiefs of the armed services and the defense industry which to little notice roundly criticized mr bush 's defense platform during the campaign judging from his recent remarks on the very small percentage of the military that he would change mr rumsfeld has decided to move slowly to those who doubt that one can have a revolution in slow motion with cautious bureaucrats managing the change it looks as if he 's throwing in the towel but the pentagon can still be transformed along the lines president bush laid out in his campaign like any radical shift in a big institution this change would have to be accomplished with a mixture of cunning compromise and ruthlessness the first step would be to fire some generals and admirals no group in washington resists change more effectively than the uniformed services which control more than 85 percent of the pentagon 's budget with little effective civilian oversight so far mr rumsfeld has seemed to expect the military leaders who grew up in the old system to be his agents of change that would not happen in any organization and certainly not in the military mr rumsfeld needs to reach down into the ranks and bring up leaders who can help make the transformation in his first year as chief of staff george c marshall retired 55 generals and over 400 colonels from the army as he attempted to remake the force just before world war ii marshall knew he had to change the army of world war i to one that could take on hitler 's military innovations and he knew he could n't do it with leaders who grew up in the horse cavalry mr rumsfeld should also work hard to encourage experimentation not only with new weapons but also with new war fighting concepts and new forms of organization the military has been bemoaning its risk averse culture for a decade but has done nothing to correct it few officers will take unusual assignments or publish controversial ideas there is a bland corporateness about military culture these days and no one will risk failure yet our military history shows that experimentation despite the unavoidable failures that will occur leads to dramatic change and success mr rumsfeld should thrust some mavericks into the limelight the old saw is that the military prepares to fight the last war under current doctrine the united states is prepared to fight two the korean war and desert storm almost all of the pentagon 's energies are directed at refighting those wars in basically the same way with the same if updated systems while there is no doubt that america should retain the capability to triumph in such conflicts it should not shoehorn its efforts into outdated war plans the pressing military need of the next 25 years will be to get to the future of warfare before the other guy mr rumsfeld 's biggest mistake so far has been to let others emphasize the costs of losing the cold war force before he articulated the security benefits and other advantages of military reform for both the defense industry and congress he should demonstrate the likely industrial and technological byproducts from creating new kinds of forces and weapons systems in the era of the cold war military for example research for defense purposes developed the use of satellites for communication and created the internet why did the pentagon start with the bad news finally mr rumsfeld needs solid white house support he can not operate in isolation from politics after all we do n't have a military for its own sake it is simply the means to ensure american security president bush needs to lay out a national security plan that describes what we hope to accomplish in the world against what obstacles in concert with which friends and with what kind of military and because this military transformation will happen over a 20

 to the editor paul krugman column feb 20 asks since the technologies that have been driving productivity have been around for a while why is it only now that productivity has taken off the answer is the combination of total quality and just in time two new ways of thinking about manufacturing that changed the way products are made and distributed from the late 1970 's to the early 1990 's they provided both the philosophy and the tools that turned traditional american manufacturing practice on its head the companies that used them like ge learned how to manufacture with speed quality and efficiency while also embracing learning and teamwork it is no accident that these same companies have gotten the most from new technologies dan ciampa wellesley mass feb 23 2000
 hockey is at once an elegant and punishing sport where a crushing but legal body check is as much a part of the game 's tactical ebb and flow as a crisply executed pass the game 's furious pace and frequent collisions also lead to fistfights relished by some spectators condemned by others as an unnecessary intrusion but everyone agrees that deliberate violence inflicted on an unprotected opponent should be severely sanctioned the national hockey league was therefore right to throw the book at the boston bruins marty mcsorley wielding his stick with both hands mcsorley struck vancouver 's donald brashear from behind sending brashear to the hospital with a concussion mcsorley was suspended for the rest of the season and will forfeit 72000 in salary the suspension was the longest in league history for an on ice infraction the vancouver police are also investigating to see whether mcsorley should be charged with assault the culture of professional hockey at least in north america has long tolerated a certain level of thuggery which means that it has also tolerated players like mcsorley mcsorley has made a good living as an enforcer protecting star players like wayne gretzky against opposing roughnecks but the line between controlled aggressiveness and gratuitous violence is very thin and mcsorley has crossed it before this was his seventh career suspension and his fifth for a stick related foul even mcsorley seemed astounded by his behavior saying i 'm still in shock at what i did which is another way of saying that even by the nhl 's permissive standards some things including assault with a potentially deadly weapon require both league sanctions and a police inquiry

 to the editor the sons also rise by paul krugman column nov 22 raises the question of why society acquiesces in policies that favor some of its members more than others for example when people with little to gain from republican economic proposals nevertheless vote republican the simple answer may be that the allure and promise of expanding capital no matter how unobtainable for many americans are enough to override concerns about the inequality it invariably creates many people like to think they could become rich and indeed may identify with the rich in some way even if wealth will probably never come in their lifetimes the gop has taken advantage of this phenomenon david narum arcata calif nov 22 2002

 the republicans controlling congress return this week to anguish over how much more of a tax cut the nation 's wealthiest citizens have coming the leaders and president bush would be wise to focus instead on the needs of the growing army of unemployed americans a total of 26 million private sector jobs have been lost across the past two years a record for any modern presidency mr bush should be jawboning on behalf of benefits for the jobless as heartily as he now tours the land for still more relief for the affluent in lobbying for at least 550 billion more in tax reductions mr bush is deriding the few resistant senate republicans for holding out for no more than what he terms a little bitty package of 350 billion in cuts over the decade this sounds like a debate over whether to let the rich eat cake or brioche but 350 billion is the only option in play for opponents meanwhile the president firmly angles to cram in his beloved dividend tax cut congressional leaders hope to settle the tax issue by memorial day and move on to health care and appropriation debates talking about budgetary losers is deemed impolitic while people are still debating how many hundred billions to forgo via the tax cuts but it 's already clear that domestic programs are facing a 168 billion cut across 10 years in such vital areas as education homeland security veterans care and transportation house republicans have already tried to sidestep culpability by installing a legislative gimmick to automatically authorize deficit borrowing instead of standing up and voting as they were elected to do lawmakers will have the 900 billion bill added on to the current 64 trillion debt ceiling neat as an after dinner drink on the people 's credit card some lawmakers at least try to remind us of creative might have beens representative richard gephardt a democrat obviously even egregiously running for the presidency has dared to suggest another go at the issue of universal health care if nothing else we can salute his sense of irony in proposing to pay for this much needed but costly social program by flatly rolling back the bush tax cuts remember those days when governments did more than cut taxes and shrink government

 my daughter mary is a peace corps volunteer in a village in mali each day she gets a small amount of drinking water which she must purify plus two buckets of water for bathing we are far more fortunate here in the united states a relatively water rich nation yet even here water restrictions have become the norm in some parts of the country in the east where supplies once seemed inexhaustible and in the arid west where a number of states along with mexico routinely fight over the trickle from what is now the parched colorado river given such realities i am puzzled that water rarely enters the debate as the bush administration and interest groups argue about roadless areas logging and forest fire management for water is perhaps the most important forest product forests generate most of the water in the country providing two thirds of all the precipitation runoff the water that comes from the sky in the 48 contiguous states some 14 percent of all runoff comes from the roughly 190 million acres of our national forests which take up only 8 percent of the land according to the environmental protection agency more than 60 million people in 3400 communities in 33 states rely on national forests for their drinking water millions more depend on state and private forests to facilitate the refilling of aquifers from which they draw their water a century ago president theodore roosevelt recognized the vital connection between forests and water when roosevelt and gifford pinchot the first united states forest service chief set up the national forest system they talked about managing for the greatest good for the greatest number for the long run this was in response to the cut and run era of timber harvests that left the united states with 80 million acres of denuded forests known as clear cuts mostly in the east and upper midwest roosevelt pinchot and other federal policymakers were most concerned about preserving the long term timber supply and the watershed function of the forests yet in modern times this connection has been lost when i was in the clinton administration i participated in more than 100 congressional and public hearings and fielded thousands of questions about forest policy then as now water rarely surfaced as a forest management issue yet water from our national forests has an economic value of more than 37 billion a year according to a forest service report issued in 2000 how do forests produce and preserve water the complex array of trees shrubs ground covers and roots slows runoff from rain and snow and water is purified as it percolates through the soil and into aquifers by slowing runoff forests also reduce floods and erosion minimizing the sediment entering streams and rivers mature forests do this work best they have the best soil and their mixed canopy a mosaic of open and closed spots among the treetops allows for snowfall accumulation and eventual runoff old trees also use less water for growth than young trees do and as intact forests better regulate water chemistry and temperatures they enhance habitats for aquatic species in many streams this means better recreational opportunities such as trout fishing new york city has some of the best water in the world because it maintains healthy forests in its catskill delaware and croton watershed system the epa recently warned that new york would have to spend more than 6 billion on a purification plant if it failed to protect those watersheds it comes as no surprise that the bush administration is proposing new forest management policies new administrations always bring new policies what 's unfortunate however is that some of these policies effectively abandon theodore roosevelt 's long term goals roosevelt valued open space preservation and resource conservation that 's why i support the recent ruling by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit which upheld the ban on building roads in roughly 60 million acres of national forest maintaining these areas is both prudent and conservative especially given the explosive rate of urban expansion and the rapid decline of open space new national forest planning regulations should now specify that the remaining old growth public forests should not be harvested since these wild lands provide the cleanest water in the country rather than wasting energy on the rancorous tired debates about road building in the wilderness and old growth forest management the focus should be on how to let our forests do their job of producing high quality water given our water supply problems this should be the highest priority of forest management mike dombeck a professor of environmental management at the university of wisconsin stevens point was chief of the united states forest service from 1997 to 2001

 to the editor frank rich 's characterization of historically black colleges and universities as a politically correct form of de facto segregation bonfire of the vanities column dec 21 is disturbing in its implications in at least two ways first it suggests that these institutions are segregated when in fact they have faculty and enroll students from all racial and ethnic backgrounds second it implies that they are worthy of support only for partisan political reasons not in their own right a great strength of american higher education is the diversity of types of institutions including those whose origins were based on serving particular groups like catholic university notre dame and brandeis historically black colleges and universities are part of this wonderfully diverse fabric i would recommend that mr rich reread another tom wolfe classic radical chic and be reminded that it is not only conservatives who can be racially insensitive walter e massey president morehouse college atlanta dec 23 2002
 to the editor i agree with your sept 5 editorial that requiring instant background checks for all gun purchases is not sufficient instant checks are not extensive enough to prevent every felon or mentally ill person from procuring firearms the mandatory five day waiting period enacted under the brady law allows for a much more thorough background check furthermore the waiting period can also help prevent violent crimes of passion that are carried out by people who are enraged and unable to make a rational decision since waiting periods force people to consider their actions and the possible repercussions of an act committed in a fit of rage manny miranda new york sept 5 2000

 the bush administration 's mishandling of education policy is shaping up into a missed opportunity of epic proportions the no child left behind act passed by congress with blaring trumpets two years ago was supposed to remake public education by closing the performance gap between rich and poor children its most important provision requires that states and districts place a qualified teacher in every classroom by 2006 in exchange for federal dollars that means ending the indefensible practice of dumping uncertified and unqualified teachers into the poorest and neediest schools unfortunately the bush administration has failed to have the program fully financed and its education department has neglected the all important issue of teacher quality while fixating on peripheral matters like making sure that the public schools permit constitutionally protected prayer a new report by the education trust a washington foundation devoted to education reform asserts that the education department is not enforcing the teacher quality provision at all but has placed the states on an honor system that preserves the disastrous status quo the report entitled in need of improvement notes that people who ask the education department for information on the teacher qualification plan are given incomplete information and in some cases information that conflicts with the statute passed by congress the president 's vow to ensure that poor and minority children who will soon make up a majority of the work force get a decent education was the most noble domestic goal of the bush administration and it is being betrayed by halfhearted follow through on the part of both the white house and congress there is still time to turn things around but right now a historic opportunity to improve public education seems to be slipping away

 the world trade organization meeting in cancun mexico has highlighted a surprising new cause promoted by a surprising new alliance the new cause is the campaign to reduce or eliminate agricultural subsidies in the united states europe and japan to make room for agricultural exports from poor nations the alliance between idealists of the left third world producers and traditional conservative promoters of free trade is equally unprecedented but the cancun coalition is unlikely to last it is bound to fray when it becomes clear that while the free traders are getting what they want out of the partnership lower taxes and expanded markets the populism and environmentalism of the left will be thwarted agricultural subsidies in the advanced industrial nations ought to be reduced but for reasons that have little to do with their impact on developing countries created to promote a rural middle class when much of the population still worked in the farm sector most subsidies are anachronistic now that agribusiness in the advanced countries employs only a tiny percentage of the population farm subsidy programs exploit consumers and taxpayers so yes the abolition of most farm subsidies by the advanced nations is an overdue reform but the result is unlikely to be the one hoped for by the left wing of the cancun coalition the enrichment of peasant farmers in fact ending subsidies if it leads to the modernization of agriculture in the developing world is likely to destroy the very sorts of communities the pro trade left seeks to support the high tech farming of the global north uses machinery instead of human labor along with huge quantities of fossil fuels and artificial fertilizers and pesticides if the third world becomes as attractive to agribusiness as the first then machines will replace family farmers who will become as rare in thailand as they are in the united states technological displacement has the potential to produce social disasters many of the inner city poor of the united states descend from farm laborers and tenant farmers displaced by the mechanization of agriculture in the south a few generations ago those who joined the middle class did so because they were able to find work in the expanding industrial and service sectors but such opportunities are scarce in the developing world for better or worse the anti subsidy movement if it succeeds is more likely to eliminate developing world farmers than to enrich them the desire of many on the left to preserve traditional small scale agriculture in the third world is also on a collision course with the goal of preserving the last remnants of global wilderness high tech agriculture wastes fossil fuels but it spares land by growing more food on less acreage genetically modified crops promise to do the same premodern third world agriculture does n't rely on chemicals or genetically modified crops but it takes far more land to grow the same crop by traditional methods than it does by means of industrial farming the earth 's remaining wilderness would be in even greater danger if the opening of northern markets were to create a financial incentive for developing nations to replace forests savannas and wetlands with land wasting peasant farms these are the alternatives then if third world agriculture is industrialized then much third world wilderness will be saved from the plow but most farmers will be forced off the farm and therefore may not profit from the access of southern agricultural exporters to northern markets if on the other hand third world agriculture is not industrialized then the effort to enrich developing countries by means of exports from labor intensive farms will inspire a vast expansion of peasant farm acreage at the expense of the environment what looked like a sweet deal that could satisfy everybody except for subsidized special interests then seems destined to fall apart on inspection first world consumers and third world agribusiness much of it foreign owned may profit from the opening of the agricultural markets of the united states and other rich nations but the activist left is unlikely to get what it wants an arcadia of prosperous village farmers living in harmony with the land michael lind is a senior fellow at the new america foundation
 to the editor you report that large law firms will pay first year associates up to 160000 to dissuade them from defecting to internet start ups law firms pay soars to stem dot com defections front page feb 2 the public should not be led to believe that lawyers generally earn such amounts large firm lawyers make up a very small percentage of american lawyers retained primarily by large companies and wealthy people they can afford to pay their lawyers huge sums most lawyers in this country do not practice in such firms and will never make 160000 a year special mention should be made of the thousands of lawyers who work for government agencies and as prosecutors and public defenders they serve the public interest while earning a small fraction of what the largest firms pay their lawyers jonathan j margolis wellesley mass feb 2 2000

 to the editor re ashcroft limiting prosecutors use of plea bargains front page sept 23 attorney general john ashcroft 's directive to federal prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges in nearly all cases and to avoid using negotiated pleas is another example of his simplistic approach to justice which overlooks the individual nature of criminal cases and their legal circumstances as experienced prosecutors know all too well treating all offenders as if their criminal acts and the roles they played in the crime were identical can be counterproductive someone should remind the attorney general that overcharging cases in which the prosecutorial evidence for a variety of reasons may be less than firm is not only inappropriate but may also be unjust even more telling it often enables guilty offenders to escape conviction because it offends jurors notion of justice cy shain san francisco sept 23 2003
 in 1993 when the supreme court demanded real scientific standards for expert evidence in federal courts some critics correctly anticipated that several criminal identification techniques would be attacked in the courts with some success microscopic hair comparison bite mark analysis handwriting comparison few if any predicted what is happening now the bedrock forensic identifier of the 20th century fingerprinting has started to wobble in a pretrial hearing in a philadelphia federal court in january judge louis h pollak sharply limited the use of fingerprint evidence in a drug related murder case he found that there is no persuasive proof that the methods used by fingerprint analysts have been adequately tested in objective controlled experiments the problem is that though fingerprints do seem to be unique identifiers any print must be read and matched the question one that can only be answered by rigorous scientific inquiry is how much of a match is required to say that a particular fingerprint is from a particular person fingerprint experts had conceded that the process they use matching large evenly pressured prints taken from suspects at the police station to smaller unevenly pressured prints from crime scenes is ultimately subjective and bedeviled by inconsistent standards the french for example require that two fingerprints match at 16 points before they can be accepted as coming from the same person the australians 12 and the swedes 7 the fbi refuses to state a number at all relying instead on case by case judgments judge pollak who is a former dean of the law schools at yale and the university of pennsylvania also noted alarmingly high error rates when fingerprint examiners took proficiency tests in 1995 only 44 percent of 156 law enforcement examiners could correctly identify all five prints in the test and in a 1998 study the number improved to only 58 percent in the coming murder trial judge pollak ruled fingerprint experts will not be allowed to express an opinion about whether fingerprints match but will only be allowed to testify as to the points they see as similar as prosecutors quickly recognized the judge 's ruling calls into question the overall acceptance of fingerprint evidence in our courts in a motion last month for reconsideration of the ruling the united states attorney cautioned that the implications of the court 's opinion undermine not only the admission of fingerprint evidence but all manner of forensic opinion testimony no one doubts that fingerprints can and do serve as a highly discriminating identifier and digital photographic enhancement and computer databases now promise to make fingerprint identification more useful than ever before but to what degree incomplete and imperfect fingerprints can be reliably used to identify individuals requires more scientific examination and the criminal system needs forensic examiners who can pass rigorous proficiency tests forensic science has rarely been subjected to the kind of scrutiny and independent verification applied to other fields of applied and medical science instead analysts testifying in courts about fingerprint analysis bite marks handwriting comparisons and the like have often argued that in their field the courtroom itself provided the test new york is the only state that regulates crime laboratories with standards even approaching those routinely used for clinical medicine as the national institutes of health finance basic scientific research the national institute of justice should put money into verification and validation before a technique of identification is admitted in court academic centers should be established for research into these questions under the aegis of medical and law schools independence and scientific rigor should be the norm for forensic science crime victims the wrongly accused and the public will all have more confidence in the system if forensic scientists and their laboratories are completely independent not beholden to prosecutors or defense attorneys peter neufeld and barry scheck are directors of the innocence project at the benjamin n cardozo school of law at yeshiva university

 to the editor still lagging on warming editorial dec 8 does n't make the vital connection between global warming terrorism and our dependency on middle east oil to reduce all three we should impose a pollution tax on petroleum based fuels this would accelerate the shift of usage toward alternate sources of energy more fuel efficient cars and homes and mass transit gradually raising the pollution tax over a period of years would give users time to update tax credits for expenditures on energy efficient cars homes and appliances would create additional incentives in so doing not only would terrorism global warming and oil imports be reduced but both the federal budget and foreign trade deficits would also be lowered and an economic stimulus would result from the race for improved fuel efficiency as well as alternate energy forms and increased mass transportation victor g lipshutz tarrytown ny dec 8 2002

 to the editor women taking active role to study orthodox judaism front page dec 21 might lead some to believe that feminism is the impetus for the increased public roles that orthodox women are assuming in fact a substantial number of orthodox women and men who discount or reject feminism are pursuing the increased involvement of women in ceremonial activities and educational opportunities out of a deep commitment to jewish law and a desire to raise religious involvement as jews to the highest level possible a case in point is the orthodox caucus an organization of rabbis community leaders and lay people which has established a special task force to promote and enhance the roles and the sensitivity accorded women in the dual context of modern life and the immutability of jewish law judith r feder brooklyn dec 21 2000

 beleaguered citizens trapped in the war zone of an endless presidential election may find it hard to believe but come jan 20 either george w bush or al gore will take office we thought it might be useful to leap ahead and take a look at what awaits a new president and congress any speculation must start with the reality that two candidates with very different personalities and visions produced an evenly divided electorate similarly democratic and republican legislative candidates offering very different approaches to domestic issues led to a house and senate with only a slight edge for the gop one question that hovers over all this is what kind of washington the public really wants another is whether all this conflict and division will set the stage for ceaseless partisan conflict or inspire a new search from moderates on both sides for a bipartisan balance point many worry that the bitterness of the presidential contest will hang over whichever candidate wins the electoral vote one hopeful sign a bare one was the gore campaign 's decision friday to dial back its threats of litigation over the florida results the bush campaign blustered unattractively about retaliatory ballot challenges in other close states and yesterday sought a federal court injunction to prevent a manual recount in some florida counties we have declared our strong preference for a prompt dignified non litigious resolution to the presidential election but however or whenever the end comes the questions remain about what kind of political world we will all inhabit to state the obvious this would be a good time for all sides including the leadership of congress to step back and think about delivering something that even those voters caught up in the heat of the moment would probably welcome an easing of the recrimination and warfare in american politics the harbingers are admittedly not great in congress under the senate majority leader trent lott republicans have been willing to tolerate shrinkage of their senate majority as the price of maintaining a reflexive ideological ferocity even now faced with the possibility of a tie in the senate mr lott has stuck to his old ways by joking tastelessly about the possibility of lightning striking hillary rodham clinton before she joins him in the capitol as tom daschle the minority leader said the senate rules are such that nothing can be done in that body without cooperation across the aisles that is doubly true if this turns out to be a senate that has 50 democrats and 50 republicans and the vice president has to be called in to break ties these factors plus mr lott 's bellicosity make it unlikely that the senate could spark a new comity prospects may be better in the house where the gop clings to the thinnest majority since the 1950 's the speaker dennis hastert has leadership potential if he can break free of fire eaters like tom delay last session he worked with president clinton and the democrats on issues including trade with china but the best chance for real progress will be the white house notwithstanding that half of the voters will be unhappy with whoever moves in mr gore or mr bush would have to try to govern from the center on some issues it will be difficult to find a middle ground but the precarious equilibrium created by voters in congress has also created an opportunity mr bush may have seen this possibility before the election when he said he would be the kind of president who would work with democrats to bring about medicare reform a prescription drug benefit and an overhaul of social security mr gore was more combative but as a senator from tennessee he reached out to republicans on foreign policy issues and he has the experience to practice the almost forgotten presidential skill of charming the opposition the next president will face a mandate problem that will force him toward tactics different from those of recent winners president reagan used his 1980 landslide to push an ambitious program of tax cuts and he picked up the support of democrats who either agreed with him or were scared to defy him although receiving only 43 percent of the popular vote in 1992 president clinton was perceived as having a mandate on health care until his legislative effort hit the skids for lack of consultation with congress one test for the next president will be to consult with key members no matter what obstacles mr lott and like minded battlers may erect our guess is that whoever wins the white house the public will let him try to lead despite lingering unhappiness over the election from woodrow wilson to john f kennedy to mr clinton american presidents have won pluralities and gone on to lead effectively if they communicated with the public and worked with congress after the spectacle of events in florida last week americans should be ready for a respite from the fratricidal politics of the last several years

 it 's only a month into the bush administration and i 'm already tired of listening to its foreign policy because it seems to be focused on only one idea which so far does n't work building a star wars missile shield against an enemy that so far does n't exist while a day does n't go by without the bush team 's reiterating its plan to build this sci fi missile shield the cia director george tenet has been highlighting some of the more immediate threats to america to which we have no policy responses mr tenet laid out his views most succinctly in senate testimony last week entitled worldwide threats to national security and they could be summarized as follows we are increasingly threatened today by a combustible combination of two new forces the failure of many nations to master modernity particularly in the middle east which is producing a lot of unemployed and angry young people in those countries combined with the spread of new information technologies which are super empowering these angry people in ways that not only threaten the stability of the states they live in but also enable them as individuals to threaten america they do n't need a missile to hit us they can fire a nuclear mortar from a rowboat off manhattan as i reflect on the threats to american national security the cia director told the senate what strikes me most forcefully is the accelerating pace of change in so many arenas that affect our national security new communications technology that enables the efforts of terrorists and narco traffickers as surely as it aids law enforcement and intelligence rapid global population growth that will create new strains in parts of the world least able to cope the weakening internal bonds in a number of states whose cohesion can no longer be taken for granted and the accelerating growth in missile capabilities in so many parts of the world maybe the best way to understand this new threat environment is to first go see the movie thirteen days about the cuban missile crisis and then reflect on last year 's love bug computer virus which after it was unleashed on the world by two filipino techies melted down roughly 10 million computers and 10 billion in data on 7 continents in 24 hours the cuban missile crisis was to the cold war system what the love bug virus is to today 's globalization system it was the event that illustrated our most dangerous vulnerability the cuban missile crisis illustrated the dangers of a world divided between two nuclear armed superpowers both of which were in charge and the love bug virus illustrated the dangers of a world connected in which no one is in charge the cold war era was a two player game with rational actors the love bug era is a multi player game with many angry non rational actors a missile shield if it can work may be necessary to protect us in this new world but it 's hardly sufficient the only way to even begin to manage this new world is by focusing on precisely the area of foreign policy that the bush team has the most contempt for nation building helping others restructure their economies and put in place decent non corrupt government listen to mr tenet on the arab world while everyone is focused on the israeli palestinian conflict he said population pressures growing public access to information and the limited prospects for economic development will have a profound impact on the future of the middle east in many places in the arab world average citizens are becoming increasingly restive and getting louder through access to the internet and other communication a restive public is increasingly capable of taking action without any identifiable leadership or organizational structure our ability to promote nation building is limited and should be approached with great humility but that does n't mean we have nothing to offer or ca n't galvanize others we will be affected by failed states with super empowered angry people a lot sooner than we 're going to face a rogue missile from north korea mr bush is speaking about foreign policy this week this is a good time for him to demonstrate that while he has his father 's foreign policy advisers he does n't have his father 's foreign policy because he certainly does n't have his father 's world

 carol browner who has made air pollution her signature issue during eight years as administrator of the environmental protection agency is ending her tenure with a ruling that will make the air in cities like new york much cleaner and healthier than it is today under a timetable announced last week by ms browner and approved by president clinton big diesel powered vehicles like trucks and buses will be subject to new rules that are intended to reduce emissions of soot and smog producing pollutants by 90 percent over time environmentalists described the plan as the biggest step forward for cleaner air since the removal of lead from gasoline in the 1970 's the linchpin of the strategy is a rule requiring refiners to reduce the sulfur content in diesel fuel by 97 percent that is crucial because sulfur not only produces soot but clogs up a vehicle 's catalytic converter the device that removes other pollutants with nearly sulfur free fuel manufacturers of diesel engines will be able to incorporate the sophisticated pollution control devices that are now standard equipment in ordinary cars the cleaner fuel will also allow the retrofitting of existing diesel engines resulting in some short term benefits even as the trucks and buses now on the road are phased out over time the benefits should be substantial buses and heavy duty trucks ranging in size from delivery vehicles to 18 wheelers account for just 6 percent of all miles driven in the united states but they produce one fourth of the smog producing chemicals in the nation and up to half the soot in cities like new york where the health benefits will be greatest last spring after years of pressure from health groups and environmental advocates new york city announced that it would begin to convert its bus fleet to natural gas or hybrid electric vehicles that conversion will continue because it offers immediate benefits whereas the national program will take time to implement fully during intense negotiations with ms browner industry representatives warned that the costs of producing the cleaner fuel would be so onerous that some refiners might stop producing diesel fuel altogether but administration officials and even some big producers including british petroleum reject this gloomy assessment in part because the rules give refiners ample lead time about 80 percent of all diesel fuel must be virtually sulfur free by 2006 the rest by 2010 the administration also argued that the public health benefits including reduced rates of cancer asthma and other diseases would outweigh the projected costs the epa has pegged this extra expense at only 1200 to 1900 apiece for cleaner engines in big vehicles that can cost up to 250000 cleaner diesel fuel would cost an extra four to six cents a gallon the epa estimates industry sources put the extra fuel costs at three times that amount but it is worth noting that ever since the original clean air act was written into law in 1970 industry in general has regularly overestimated the costs of environmental rules while underestimating the ability of its own engineers to satisfy those rules in a timely cost effective way ms browner is betting that improved technology can deliver cleaner fuels and cleaner vehicles at affordable prices historically that has been a safe bet of course president elect george w bush could order his new epa administrator gov christie whitman to overturn the new regulations some of mr bush 's friends in the oil industry may well ask him to do so but that would require him to begin the laborious process of drafting regulations all over again it would also demonstrate an amazing indifference to the public 's demonstrated desire for cleaner air

 the current crisis in american capitalism is n't just about the specific details about tricky accounting stock options loans to executives and so on it 's about the way the game has been rigged on behalf of insiders and the bush administration is full of such insiders that 's why president bush can not get away with merely rhetorical opposition to executive wrongdoers to give the most extreme example so far how can we take his moralizing seriously when thomas white whose division of enron generated 500 million in phony profits and who sold 12 million in stock just before the company collapsed is still secretary of the army yet everything mr bush has said and done lately shows that he does n't get it asked about the aloha petroleum deal at his former company harken energy in which big profits were recorded on a sale that was paid for by the company itself a transaction that obviously had no meaning except as a way to inflate reported earnings he responded there was an honest difference of opinion sometimes things are n't exactly black and white when it comes to accounting procedures and he still opposes both reforms that would reduce the incentives for corporate scams such as requiring companies to count executive stock options against profits and reforms that would make it harder to carry out such scams such as not allowing accountants to take consulting fees from the same firms they audit the closest thing to a substantive proposal in mr bush 's tough talking nearly content free speech on tuesday was his call for extra punishment for executives convicted of fraud but that 's an empty threat in reality top executives rarely get charged with crimes not a single indictment has yet been brought in the enron affair and even chainsaw al dunlap a serial book cooker faces only a civil suit and they almost never get convicted accounting issues are technical enough to confuse many juries expensive lawyers make the most of that confusion and if all else fails big name executives have friends in high places who protect them in this as in so much of the corporate governance issue the current wave of scandal is prefigured by president bush 's own history an aside some pundits have tried to dismiss questions about mr bush 's business career as unfair it was long ago and hence irrelevant yet many of these same pundits thought it was perfectly appropriate to spend seven years and 70 million investigating a failed land deal that was even further in bill clinton 's past and if they want something more recent how about reporting on the story of mr bush 's extraordinarily lucrative investment in the texas rangers which became so profitable because of a highly incestuous web of public policy and private deals as in the case of harken no hard work is necessary joe conason laid it all out in harper 's almost two years ago but the harken story still has more to teach us because the sec investigation into mr bush 's stock sale is a perfect illustration of why his tough talk wo n't scare well connected malefactors mr bush claims that he was vetted by the sec in fact the agency 's investigation was peculiarly perfunctory it somehow decided that mr bush 's perfectly timed stock sale did not reflect inside information without interviewing him or any other members of harken 's board maybe top officials at the sec felt they already knew enough about mr bush his father the president had appointed a good friend as sec chairman and the general counsel who would normally make decisions about legal action had previously been george w bush 's personal lawyer he negotiated the purchase of the texas rangers i am not making this up most corporate wrongdoers wo n't be quite as well connected as the young mr bush but like him they will expect and probably receive kid glove treatment in an interesting parallel today 's sec which claims to be investigating the highly questionable accounting at halliburton that turned a loss into a reported profit has yet to interview the ceo at the time dick cheney the bottom line is that in the last week any hopes you might have had that mr bush would make a break from his past and champion desperately needed corporate reform have been dashed mr bush is not a real reformer he just plays one on tv e mail krugman nytimescom

 more than 3000 years ago from his compound on the banks of the nile ramses ii issued an order that modern day governors and mayors will find depressingly familiar ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore the pharaoh commanded let them go and gather straw for themselves but they still had to produce the same number of bricks ramses ii had invented the unfunded mandate in the short run it was not a success the hebrew people against whom the mandate was directed thought it so unfair that they left egypt altogether over the ensuing centuries however countless government officials at all levels have played it pharaoh 's way they have seized upon the idea that if you are in a position of power you can tell underlings to do anything you want them to do you do n't have to explain the reasoning you do n't have to provide the equipment and while some will complain of the injustice of it all most will comply unlike the ancient hebrews they have no miracles to call on and no promised land to flee to this is the flaw in any experiment with federalism including america 's congress can demand that states institute elaborate new testing programs for schoolchildren offering no money to pay for them a federal agency can impose billions of dollars in security costs on local law enforcement officials and postpone the question of how to pay them until another day states can cut back drastically on their support for public health at the local level while insisting that local authorities keep the service going just as before nobody is innocent here the feds stiff the states the states stiff the cities and counties whenever one layer of government can push an unpleasant or costly responsibility down to the level below it nearly always does so the cities and counties would do it too except they are on the bottom rung yet we are astonishingly earnest about pretending to worship an entirely different set of principles for hundreds of years philosophers across the ideological spectrum have preached the virtue of devolution higher levels of political power and authority should grant as much freedom as possible to lower ones on the grounds that greater wisdom really does reside at the grass roots in the roman catholic church devolution goes by the name of subsidiarity the principle that as pope john paul ii once put it a community of a higher order should not interfere in the internal life of a community of a lower order to the radical students for a democratic society in the 1960 's devolution was a new kind of participatory democracy through which our monster cities might now be humanized broken into smaller communities arranged according to community decision for most conservative republicans in the years since the reagan administration it has been an article of faith that the best government is government closest to the people that the states are closer to the people than washington is and the localities closer still the fact that most of us find these principles congenial and sensible however does not deter governments from blithely ignoring them it was a devolution preaching republican congress that passed a bill in 1999 forbidding states to collect sales tax on transactions over the internet without a fig leaf of an explanation why this was their business and it was a devolution professing democratic president a former governor himself who signed it into law one might have expected something different from george w bush who as governor of texas spent six years in austin bristling at the intrusions of washington in his state 's affairs but no such outburst of intellectual consistency was forthcoming not only is there the administration 's school testing mandate which could cost state and local governments up to 8 billion but there is the huge problem of medicaid costs the most serious culprit in the states financial troubles medicaid is officially a joint state federal responsibility yet the president has shown little interest in helping the states meet their obligations earlier this year the governors descended on washington to plead for help with their worsening budget crisis we 've got an issue with our own budget the president told them in other words you 're on your own deal with it but keep those bricks coming here 's an idea if the bush administration wants to avoid paying too much for the reconstruction of iraq all it has to do is grant iraq statehood then it could just refuse to give it any money the federal government would save tens of billions of dollars it 's enough to make you feel sorry for the states until you see them treating their own cities and counties the same way to take just one example of about 50 mike easley governor of north carolina last year closed a hole in the state budget by simply seizing more than 200 million in tax money that was supposed to have paid for local health care education and criminal justice one might portray this as yet another example of the strong picking on the weak but in a federal system unreasonable demands from above are n't a sign of strength they 're a sign of weakness when the system actually works as it occasionally does the leaders at the top of the pyramid do one of two things they take up a problem conceive a solution and figure out a way to pay for it as the federal government did with social security in the 1930 's or they withdraw completely and allow lower level governments to do the experiments and make the rules this is essentially what happened with welfare reform arguably the most successful public policy initiative of the last decade when neither of these things happens when one level of government simply dumps a problem on the level below it 's usually because underneath the bluster those at the top are clueless about what to do if federal officials had any clear idea how to improve the performance of american education they 'd be promoting it they would n't be telling state and local school systems to spend billions of dollars on standardized tests and then to punish the slackers and when governors and legislatures boast about holding the line on taxes but the truth is they are merely forcing higher taxes on those below that 's a form of weakness as well any mandate from above unaccompanied by the resources to help comply with it is a scary experience for those on the receiving end but it can also be an opportunity to experiment innovate and discover that there might be a way to get the job done more efficiently after all sometimes the forces at the top are n't quite as powerful as they had presumed that 's a lesson in federalism straight out of the old testament op ed contributor alan ehrenhalt is executive editor of governing magazine

 to the editor president clinton 's initiative to increase staffing ratios and improve care for nursing home residents is a welcome one news article sept 17 unfortunately it comes at a time of increasing labor shortages in addition a recent ruling by the federal health care financing administration mandates that only certified nurse 's assistants can feed residents in nursing homes historically specially trained volunteers have successfully assisted in feeding residents allowing certified assistants to spend time assisting residents with functions requiring more skilled training this recent ruling prohibits an enriching volunteer experience and makes president clinton 's goal of improved staffing ratios even harder to achieve daniel reingold bronx sept 17 2000 the writer is executive vice president of the hebrew home for the aged at riverdale
 so harvey pitt decided not to tell other members of the securities and exchange commission a small detail about the man he had chosen to head a crucial new accounting oversight board after turning his back on a far more qualified candidate william webster reports stephen labaton of the times headed the audit committee at us technologies now that company is being sued by investors who claim that management defrauded them of millions and what did mr webster 's committee do after an outside auditor raised concerns about the company 's financial controls that 's right it fired the auditor mr pitt 's response when this story broke beats anything a satirist could have imagined pitt seeks probe of himself read one headline honest mr pitt 's own agency will investigate how he chose mr webster meanwhile what was mr webster thinking nobody thinks he 's corrupt but having failed so spectacularly to police executives at a single small company how could he imagine himself qualified to enforce honest accounting for all of corporate america yet it 's no accident that mr pitt picked the wrong man mr webster was chosen over better candidates precisely because accounting industry lobbyists a group that clearly still includes mr pitt believed he would be ineffectual let 's call it the pitt principle the famous peter principle said that managers fail because they rise to their level of incompetence the pitt principle tells us that sometimes incompetence is exactly what the people in charge want in this particular case ordinary investors demanded a crackdown on corporate malfeasance and mr pitt pretended to comply but this administration is run by and for people who have profited handsomely from their insider connections remember harken and halliburton and why wo n't the administration come clean about that energy task force so he picked someone with an impressive but irrelevant background whom he could count on not to get the job done this principle explains a lot for example the treasury secretary 's job is to pursue sound fiscal and economic policies so if you do n't want that job done you appoint a prominent manufacturing executive with little understanding either of federal budgets or of macroeconomics he 'll be just the man to preside over a lightning fast transition from record budget surpluses to huge deficits he 'll even cheerily declare that the latest indicators look good just days before consumer confidence plunges to a nine year low the attorney general 's job is to uphold the constitution and enforce the rule of law so if you do n't want that job done you pick a former senator who does n't have much respect either for the law or for the constitution particularly silly stuff about due process separation of church and state and all that he 'll be just the man to respond to a national crisis by imprisoning more than 1000 people without charges while catching not a single person who has committed an act of terrorism not even the anthrax mailer the same principle can be applied at lower levels intelligence and defense experts should realistically assess threats to national security and the consequences of us military action so if you do n't want that job done you place it in the hands of prominent neoconservative intellectuals with no real world experience they can be counted on to perceive terrorist links where the cia says they do n't exist and to offer blithe assurances about fighting a war in a densely populated urban area when the military itself is very nervous but the most important application of the pitt principle comes at the top the president 's job is to unify the nation and lead it through difficult times if you do n't want that job done you appoint an affable fellow from a famous family who has led a charmed business and political life thanks to his insider advantage he 'll be the kind of guy who sees nothing wrong in seeking partisan advantage from a national crisis even going so far as to declare that members of the other party do n't care about the nation 's security that way a great surge of national unity and good feeling can be converted in little more than a year into a growing sense of dismay with more and more americans saying that the country is going in the wrong direction e mail krugman nytimescom

 the high point make that the low point of the american way of death is jessica mitford 's account of a friend 's attempt to bury a relative without spending a fortune when the friend asked for an inexpensive redwood coffin the funeral home agreed at first but the salesman called back to say the deceased was too tall and she had to buy a coffin that cost 100 more when ms mitford 's friend balked the salesman responded oh all right we 'll use the redwood one but we 'll have to cut off his feet this summer it feels as if big business is letting us down as never before but corporate scandals have been a part of american history since the yazoo land fraud of 1795 thirty nine years ago ms mitford exposed one of the most jaw dropping of all the great funeral industry scandal of 1963 her findings acerbically set forth in her surprise best seller hold some important lessons for today 's reformers this unlikely scandal was set off by an unlikely crusader one of six daughters of the baron of redesdale ms mitford left the british aristocracy behind and married bob treuhaft an oakland trade union lawyer from him she learned that when working men died their hard won death benefits intended to support their widows and children invariably ended up in the pockets of unscrupulous undertakers on the trail of injustice ms mitford made undercover visits to funeral parlors and pored over back issues of casket sunnyside and the rest is muckraking history the american way of death soared to the top of the new york times best seller list and ignited a firestorm cbs turned it into an hourlong documentary and newspapers from new york to san francisco investigated local funeral practices ms mitford 's encounters with shady undertakers and cemetery plot salesmen led her to some conclusions that apply to today 's corporate scandals or most likely soon will 1 never underestimate corporate greed before her book came out funeral directors presented themselves as humble comforters of the bereaved but ms mitford showed that they charged more to bury 17 million americans a year than universities charged to educate 36 million many observers of today 's scandals have been shocked by how far rich people will go to become richer bernard ebbers who took in more than 46 million at worldcom still grabbed nearly a million shares of hot ipo stock possibly illegally martha stewart who is worth a good fraction of a billion dollars took the time to personally trade perhaps using insider information a few thousand shares of imclone stock having met prosperous businessmen who would threaten to cut off a loved one 's feet to make a few more bucks ms mitford would not have been a bit surprised 2 corporate crooks often tell us exactly what they 're doing much of the american way of death is simply excerpts from the funeral industry 's own publications the book successful funeral management warned undertakers not to line up coffins by price since it made it too easy for the grieving family to comparison shop so it is with the current scandal where the most damning evidence is in many cases the wrongdoers own words wall street analysts issued buy recommendations while yukking it up in internal e mails that the stocks were junk ceo 's made bullish pronouncements duping their shareholders and employees while filling out forms to sell their own stock when their words are quoted back to them in legal indictments it will be akin to what ms mitford retorted to funeral directors who complained about her book she could not see why they were unhappy since it was almost entirely given over to expounding their point of view 3 sometimes it is n't just the bad apples president bush has tried to argue that the misdeeds of enron worldcom and the rest are ethical lapses of a few bad actors and that the solution is criminal prosecutions but the point of the american way of death is that the funeral industry as a whole was corrupt this would normally be the place to say 'i am not of course speaking of the vast majority of ethical undertakers ms mitford wrote in the foreword but the vast majority of ethical undertakers is precisely the subject of this book the only solution she insisted as reformers today must was sweeping reform 4 reform comes slowly for those hoping for meaningful reform now the funeral experience is sobering when the american way of death came out in 1963 the public was outraged but despite a flood of angry letters it took the federal trade commission until 1972 to begin an investigation it was 12 more years before it adopted over strenuous industry lobbying a rule instituting some of the reforms ms mitford had recommended the new rule required funeral homes but not cemeteries to itemize services and costs in advance so consumers could decide which they wanted still when ms mitford died in 1996 much of her agenda had been blocked the senate held hearings this summer on a bill to be introduced later this month that would among other things require cemeteries to itemize costs just in time for the 40th anniversary of ms mitford 's explosive little book

 the bush administration did the right thing on diesel emissions this week curbing an important source of air pollution yet george bush has in general reneged on the environmental promises of his 2000 campaign most notably he broke his campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide emissions offering instead a purely voluntary and therefore one might have thought meaningless plan to limit global warming but even this it turns out was too much for mr bush 's party the energy bill passed by house republicans last week did n't include any plan even a voluntary one to limit greenhouse emissions why the answer i believe has to do with an aversion to all things global on its face the bush plan on global warming was a sham relying on the kindness of corporations the department of energy would have issued credits to companies that reduced carbon dioxide emissions but since there would have been no legal limits those credits would simply have been a symbolic recognition of good behavior or would they right wing think tanks engaged in a concerted and successful campaign to persuade congress to reject the bush scheme those think tanks argued that keeping track of emission reductions would make it easier for a future administration to introduce a real global warming policy companies that had accumulated credits might favor measures that gave those credits some value more broadly they opposed any legitimization of the idea that global warming is a problem but why would that be such a bad thing from their point of view we can safely dismiss the idea that the right has carefully weighed the scientific evidence and concluded that the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is wrong we can also dismiss the idea that conservatives have carefully examined the economics of emission controls and concluded that they are too expensive so was it just politics as usual opposition to a global warming policy partly reflects a general aversion to government regulation do n't forget that tom delay the house majority leader is a former exterminator who entered politics because he was angry about controls on pesticide use but the ferocity with which the right opposes any policy to limit greenhouse gases even the nearly empty bush plan goes beyond general anti environmentalism what 's different about global warming i think is that unlike local pollution dealing with it requires concerted action by governments around the world and that 's what the right really ca n't stand this should n't be surprising there was a time when us conservatives were isolationists nobody thinks that 's a viable position nowadays but the same impulses an assertion of moral superiority an unwillingness to consider alternative points of view lie behind america 's new spirit of unilateralism we obviously ca n't ignore the world but many americans reject the idea that other countries should have any say over what we do but what happens when unilateralists encounter problems that clearly require the cooperation of other countries not as junior partners but as equals right now the answer is simply to deny the existence of those problems the greenhouse effect is a quintessentially global issue fine we 'll deny that global warming exists fighting stateless terrorists demands a global cooperative effort fine we 'll fight terrorism by launching a conventional war against a regime that nasty as it was had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks eventually of course and sooner rather than later this attempt to deny reality will fail while we 've been watching the iraq show many past achievements of us foreign policy have been disintegrating through neglect and arrogance the united states has squandered the good will it built up in latin america in the 1990 's for half a century the us has regarded the drive toward free trade as a key part of its global strategy now trade negotiations are falling apart from lack of attention even in iraq we 're starting to see that winning the war was the easy part and us officials previously dismissive of old europe are suddenly talking about an international peacekeeping force but to be effective such a force like the one in afghanistan would surely have to include french and german soldiers the truth is that we ca n't go it alone but by the time that truth sinks in there may be a lot of pieces to pick up e mail krugman nytimescom
 to the editor re more guns for everyone by bob herbert column may 9 i strongly oppose the politics of attorney general john ashcroft and of the national rifle association but reading the second amendment as protecting an individual as well as a collective right would not necessarily entrench their absolutist stance on gun control if the courts follow mr ashcroft 's lead the likely scenario will be the recognition of a limited individual right to bear arms subject to the same type of balancing against public health and safety considerations as are freedom of speech free exercise of religion and privacy rights widely supported common sense laws like the brady gun control law or the ban on assault weapons which the nra and its allies would like to see overturned would still be constitutional shauna burgess princeton nj may 9 2002

 the world needs both more electricity and less pollution the goals are not incompatible but the solution will require better management of demand smarter use of coal as well as renewable energy sources and increased use of nuclear power as congress considers an energy bill when it returns from recess it will be under pressure to expand or limit the use of nuclear power the issue however is not simple more nuclear power will be necessary but more nuclear plants will be built only if more safeguards and incentives are put in place the challenge is to make nuclear energy safer cleaner and more economical we built a model to compare the costs of producing electricity from new nuclear coal and natural gas plants the model focuses on economic cost not regulated or subsidized cost according to our study the baseline cost of new nuclear power is 67 cents per kilowatt hour compared to 42 cents for coal and natural gas when the price of gas is 450 per thousand cubic feet plausible but unproved technology could reduce nuclear costs to those of coal and gas however if a cost is assigned to carbon emissions either through a tax or some other way as in a current congressional proposal that would limit emissions but allow companies to buy and sell the right to discharge more pollutants nuclear power could become an attractive economic option for example a 50 per ton carbon value about the cost of capturing and separating the carbon dioxide product of coal and natural gas combustion raises the cost of coal to 54 cents and natural gas to 48 cents even under these favorable circumstances the regulatory uncertainty threatening the large scale investment needed for a nuclear plant will require some government assistance a production tax credit similar to that extended to wind power is a good idea it would give private investors an incentive to complete a plant if no plant is built and operated no public money is spent if the first plants are indeed built and operated competitively more will follow and the possibility of reducing greenhouse gases increases besides cost there is the problem of nuclear waste while it is technically possible to dispose of spent fuel safely the issue is actually doing it successful operation of the planned yucca mountain repository in nevada would be an important step but the department of energy 's nuclear waste research and development program should consider solutions beyond mined depositories like yucca mountain for example burying spent fuel several kilometers deep in a dry well called a borehole may offer significant cost and environmental benefits compared to mined repositories this and other possibilities should be systematically explored finally there is the challenge of nonproliferation which is complex because of its international dimensions there is no question that the current nonproliferation regime needs to be strengthened particular attention must be paid to enrichment technology and reprocessing enrichment which converts natural uranium into reactor fuel can produce uranium well beyond reactor grade suitable for weapons reprocessing separates plutonium metal which can be used directly in weapons from reactor fuel there is ample uranium available so that reprocessing can be avoided for at least the next 50 years in the near term the priority should be to require signatories to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty like iran to accept inspections of suspected but undeclared nuclear facilities for the longer term advanced nations that operate nuclear facilities should offer to provide fuel to reactors in less developed nations and to remove all spent fuel nuclear power can make an important contribution to meeting the world 's growing electricity needs while helping to reduce carbon emissions but this contribution will be realized only if the united states and other nations focus on making today 's technology work and avoid expensive advanced technologies that involve reprocessing which presents serious proliferation risks it will be difficult of course to carry forward this nuclear agenda yet it will also be difficult to limit greenhouse gas emissions adequately while satisfying global energy needs for social and economic development in both of these endeavors american leadership is essential op ed contributor john deutch professor of chemistry at mit and former director of central intelligence was in the energy department from 1977 to 1980 ernest moniz professor of physics at mit was in the energy department from 1997 to 2001 they directed a recent mit study on nuclear energy
 to the editor the reason the popular vote is meaningless is that the candidates spend millions of dollars on advertising in those states that they have a chance to win and thus gain the electoral votes news articles nov 9 both candidates knew the rules ahead of time they knew it was n't a popular vote and they campaigned accordingly it is a popular vote by state only not the country as a whole if george w bush thought it was a popularity contest he most certainly would have campaigned more in the east coast states that he knew he was n't going to win as a matter of fact both candidates would n't have wasted much time here in minnesota during the final week but they did why because they were trying to win crucial electoral votes not a popularity contest they both knew they needed electoral votes that 's how they played the game you ca n't change the rules during the game james w sampair jr st paul nov 9 2000

 to the editor re arthritis surgery in ailing knees is cited as sham front page july 11 it is a mistake to use a research publication that is focused on osteoarthritis or degenerative arthritis of the knee to suggest that knee arthroscopy is ineffective for treating knee pain caused by torn cartilage or ligaments conditions far more likely to have arthroscopic treatment than is osteoarthritis over the past 25 years thousands of clinical research publications have confirmed the effectiveness of arthroscopic knee surgery in relieving knee pain for millions of americans osteoarthritis of the knee constitutes only a small segment of those who have arthroscopic knee surgery and for the much larger group with torn cartilage and ligaments arthroscopic surgery remains effective less invasive and more cost effective treatment than was available before its advent vernon t tolo md peter fowler md rosemont ill july 15 2002 the writers are the presidents of respectively the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons and the american orthopaedic society for sports medicine

 to the editor re a secret 's staying power by nadine cohodas op ed dec 27 it is unforgivable and incomprehensible that journalists among many others kept the secret that strom thurmond was the father of a mixed race daughter when the republicans were excoriating president bill clinton for his comparatively mild indiscretion and the press was having a field day with that story everyone kept quiet amazing elaine stone chappaqua ny dec 27 2003
 to the editor re errors that kill medical patients editorial dec 18 the emphasis on medical errors is demoralizing to doctors and counterproductive consider some of the miracles of the last century blood transfusion antibiotics vaccinations and transplantation we can now do more good for more people with more diseases than ever before in our aggressive stance against disease we make mistakes these outcomes are typically not the work of poorly trained doctors or overworked trainees but rather the cost of performing complex procedures or applying cutting edge technologies that have real and well described risk shall we return to the days when a doctor could offer only a prayer and a kind word it did n't do much good but at least we did n't make mistakes robert c gorman md philadelphia dec 18 2002
 in the early 1990 's archaeologists from the university of arizona examined samples of household garbage in tucson on the monday after thanksgiving their purpose was to decipher the nature of the feast by deciphering the garbage as a scholar might examine the kitchen middens in the remains of an ancient village they broke each sample into a list of ingredients from faunal material turkey bones to beverage related items like the plastic ring from a six pack the hardest task these archaeologists faced was trying to draw conclusions only from the physical evidence as if they were not members of the culture that produced it most of us have been to thanksgivings where we feel like the archaeologist at the party who we wonder are these people how do their kinship structures work what is this strange food we 're eating probably somebody felt that way at tucson thanksgiving c45 120291 where the most numerous items in the garbage were paper plates 38 and cigarette filter tips 190 but the same feeling crops up at fancier parties too few things induce the archaeologist effect the feeling of standing well outside one 's culture faster than highly formalized food rituals which usually do n't involve paper plates but often do involve in laws and advanced arrays of cutlery you could sort through america 's thanksgiving garbage till new year 's and never deduce from it just why we celebrate this holiday it would be one thing if the day marked a real divergence from the american pattern of consumption ending months of barely enough with suddenly too much yet for most of us every day is a case of a little more than we need one student of feasts stipulates that they contain foods not generally served at daily meals for most americans however daily meals now include foods that never used to be served at daily meals by the standards of earlier eras every day is a feast day which is one way of saying that the very idea of a feast has begun to lose its meaning the pilgrim thanksgiving was a way of giving thanks not for plenty but for a sufficiency as for us we are better acquainted with too much than with enough today would be a good day to give thanks for just enough and to share the extra with those who lack even that much if we did we would all have more to be thankful for verlyn klinkenborg
 my family like so many others was excited about saturday 's release of yet another harry potter book but although there are many legitimate reasons for praising the series the exciting plots the new young readers being drawn to books the quality of the writing i am disappointed about one thing the decision by scholastic publisher of the american edition to translate the books from english into american scholastic even went so far as to change the title of the first harry potter book from harry potter and the philosopher 's stone to harry potter and the sorcerer 's stone why were the editors worried that some people would n't buy the book because they could n't understand it in its original language were they concerned that some children would be confused by new words for otherwise familiar objects or actions i like to think that our society would not collapse if our children started calling their mothers mum instead of mom and i would hate to think that today 's children would be frightened away from an otherwise thrilling book by reading that the hero is wearing a jumper instead of a sweater are we afraid that when presented with new vocabulary children will shrink away or that alternative spellings of previously known words will make children and adults suddenly start spelling things wrong sending school test scores falling a careful reading of both the english and the american editions of harry potter and the sorcerer 's stone reveals three kinds of substitutions the first are spelling differences gray for grey color for colour flavor for flavour pajamas for pyjamas recognize for recognise and the like the second are differences in common words or phrases pitch turns to field sellotaped to taped fortnight to two weeks post to mail boot of car to trunk of car lorry to truck the third are metamorphoses of truly english experiences or objects into something different but distinctly american crumpets to english muffins for example a particularly odious change in my opinion my two sons did n't have any difficulty understanding the british version of the book sent to them by their aunt in london i admit to occasionally offering the meaning of a new word the first time it appeared but do n't we do that with every book we read to our children or help them read to themselves do we really want children to think that crumpets are the same as english muffins frankly reading about harry and hermione eating crumpets during tea is far more interesting to an american than reading about them eating english muffins during a meal are any books immune from this kind of devolution from english to american english would we sit back and let publishers rewrite charles dickens or shakespeare i can see it now a christmas song a story of two cities the salesman of venice by protecting our children from an occasional misunderstanding or trip to the dictionary we are pretending that other cultures are or should be the same as ours by insisting that everything be americanized we dumb down our own society rather than enrich it as for harry potter 's latest adventures my children and i will wait for the british version coming by mail peter h gleick is the author of the world 's water 2000 2001

 this afternoon millions of people who never pay any attention to horse racing will be likely to flip on their television sets to watch the belmont stakes war emblem a horse with a difficult personality and legs full of bone chips is trying for the triple crown if he wins he will become one of racing 's immortals right up there with secretariat and affirmed and seattle slew if he loses he will be consigned to the ranks of canonero ii real quiet and silver charm who all won the derby and the preakness but failed to make it in new york the triple crown is one of those achievements like the home run record that hold a fascination for people who do not normally pay any attention to sports only 11 horses have won it in the century and a quarter that the three races have been run if you have reached middle age and have a single vision of a horse race it is more likely than not of secretariat drawing away in the belmont by 31 lengths breaking the track record winning the triple crown and fixing himself in popular memory as the archetypal thoroughbred asking a three year old horse still a kid really to run a mile and a half race is a bit silly even older horses seldom run that far and to do it after two other hard contests over a five week period is really an invitation to disaster it would make no sense to press a valuable animal that hard if the public had not decided for some reason that this was the ultimate achievement in racing affirmed was the last triple crown winner in 1978 since then eight horses have won the kentucky derby and preakness but because the seven preceding war emblem failed in the belmont they are now remembered only by people who are actually interested in horse racing during some period other than a three race campaign in the late spring war emblem is not a sentimental favorite he is owned by a saudi prince who bought him three weeks before the derby for 900000 it is not the sort of story that 's likely to have people lining up to commission a movie about his life but if he wins we will get over it very few thoroughbreds of this caliber are owned by humble folk who just happen to love horses or small boys who raise them to stardom on the family farm if you are good enough at your job your performance transcends small matters of personality background and history you are what you did and if war emblem can pull it off decades from now people who go years without seeing a horse race will still remember his name

 last year i tried to illustrate just how far to the right america 's ruling party has moved by quoting some of representative tom delay 's past remarks i got some puzzling responses who cares what some crazy guy in congress says wrote one liberal economist chiding me for being alarmist some crazy guy public images are funny things newt gingrich became a famous symbol of republican radicalism by contrast most people know little about mr delay the house majority leader yet mr delay is more radical and more powerful than mr gingrich ever was maybe mr delay 's public profile will be raised by his success yesterday in sabotaging tax credits for 12 million children those tax credits would cost only 35 billion but mr delay has embedded the credits in an 82 billion tax cut package that is he wants to extort 22 in tax cuts in the face of record budget deficits for every dollar given to poor children but the really important stories about mr delay a central figure in the impeachment of bill clinton involve his continuing drive to give his party a permanent lock on power consider the case of westar energy whose chief executive was indicted for fraud the subsequent investigation turned up e mail in which executives described being solicited by republican politicians for donations to groups linked to mr delay in return for a legislative seat at the table the provision westar wanted was duly inserted into an energy bill republican leaders deny that there was any quid pro quo there 's every reason to believe that the westar case is unusual only in the fact that the transaction came to light under mr delay 's leadership republicans have established a huge fund raising advantage based not just on promises special interests have always been able to buy favorable policies but never so brazenly but also on threats mr delay pioneered the k street strategy which in a radical break with tradition punishes lobbying firms that try to maintain good relations with both parties then there 's the texas redistricting story normally states redraw congressional districts once a decade texas redistricted after the 2000 census but under mr delay 's leadership texas republicans are trying to increase their advantage in seats with a second redistricting this in itself is an unprecedented power grab but it gets worse texas democrats responded with a parliamentary maneuver walking out to deprive the state legislature of a quorum in response hundreds of state law enforcement officers were diverted from crime fighting to search for the missing democrats assisted yes by the department of homeland security a telling anecdote when an employee tried to stop mr delay from smoking a cigar on government property the majority leader shouted i am the federal government not quite not yet but he 's getting there so what will mr delay and his associates do with their lock on power once it is firmly established they will push through a radical right wing agenda for example expect to see much less environmental protection mr delay has described the environmental protection agency as the gestapo above all expect to see the wall between church and state come tumbling down mr delay has said that he went into politics to promote a biblical worldview and that he pursued president clinton because he did n't share that view where would this worldview be put into effect how about the schools after the columbine school shootings mr delay called a press conference in which he attributed the tragedy to the fact that students are taught the theory of evolution there 's no point in getting mad at mr delay and his clique they are what they are i do however get angry at moderates liberals and traditional conservatives who avert their eyes pretending that current disputes are just politics as usual they are n't what we 're looking at here is a radical power play which if it succeeds will transform our country yet it 's considered uncool to point that out many of those who minimize the threat the radical right now poses to america as we know it would hate to live in the country mr delay wants to create yet by playing down the seriousness of the challenge they help bring his vision closer to reality e mail krugman nytimescom
 to the editor an unmentioned benefit of the system proposed by michael lind op ed oct 2 for the states to divide their electoral votes among the candidates on the breakdown of the popular vote is that it would render moot the concern over the leaking of election results before the polls close in the west if voters in california or alaska know they can make the decisive difference in a presidential contest that will reinvigorate the process from maine to hawaii tom neven colorado springs oct 2 2000
 after a summer in which it seemed as if harvey pitt might be getting religion on accounting reforms he has now reverted to form mr pitt chairman of the securities and exchange commission is on the verge of botching one of its most pressing missions the creation of a credible oversight board for the accounting profession mr pitt appears to be having second thoughts about appointing as board chairman john biggs the respected tiaa cref pension fund manager who has long favored tightening accounting practices mr biggs is precisely the kind of tough minded leader who should be put in charge of the panel the objections to mr biggs from the accounting industry and its defenders on capitol hill only confirm his suitability for the post mr biggs has been a strong proponent of barring auditors from doing any consulting and requiring companies to rotate their auditors he was among the early proponents of forcing companies to treat executive stock options as a compensation expense affecting the bottom line creation of the independent five member board empowered to set standards for accountants was the centerpiece of the reform bill approved by congress this summer one that republican house leaders and the bush administration only belatedly supported after a slew of accounting scandals that contributed to the stock market 's meltdown having failed to prevent passage of the law the accounting lobby is now maneuvering to keep serious reformers off the oversight board the new board must play a strong role in restoring investors faith in the integrity of financial markets it will have broad discretion to set ethics rules such as conflict of interest standards for accountants auditing public companies and assign extensive disciplinary powers to enforce them the board will also review the performance of the major accounting firms this regulatory body 's creation is a direct response to the glaring conflicts of interest that accounting firms had been engaging in and to the industry 's notoriously weak history of disciplining its own if harvey pitt wants to retain sufficient credibility to stay on the job he should hasten to name mr biggs or someone of his caliber as chairman of the accounting oversight board
 last week the federal communications commission approved a plan to start licensing micro radio stations small low power outlets that can be heard for a radius of four to seven miles it 's a limited plan only a few new outlets will be awarded in most large urban areas and only noncommercial stations will be licensed but there 's a good chance that the change will at least begin to make american radio more lively interesting and diverse more stations after all mean more voices there will be room for different styles of music for different political perspectives for stations less afraid to experiment on a radio dial that seems blander every year micro radio offers at least the potential for something new to the extent that this vision comes true the credit should go to a much maligned group the pirates these small illegal broadcasters who go on the air without federal licenses already constitute a lively micro radio movement the fcc is coming late to the game twenty years ago unlicensed radio was a hobby something for tinkerers and egotists by the late 1990 's it was a bustling movement with hundreds of pirate stations around the country broadcasting everything from fundamentalism to funk the fcc facing a wave of civil disobedience had a crisis of authority that it needed to address it 's a little cheaper to build a radio transmitter today than it was in 1980 but what really made micro radio grow was not technology but federal policy first the fcc stopped issuing licenses for noncommercial stations with less than 100 watts of power then under pressure from the broadcast industry the commission reversed the policy it had tentatively embraced in the 1980 's of allowing more stations to enter a city 's market instead making it easier for existing businesses to own more stations within a market little stations were out and consolidation was in small broadcasters began going on the air without licenses not just to get more eclectic fare onto the air but to force the fcc to defend its policies in the courts of law and public opinion what began as a collection of isolated stations soon grew into an organized if decentralized movement with conferences internet lists and lobbying campaigns the fcc has acknowledged no debt to the pirates indeed its new plan denies licenses to people known to have broadcast illicitly since last february unless they immediately left the air when instructed to but the very phrase micro radio was popularized by the pirates long before william kennard the commission 's chairman adopted it and it is unlikely that anyone in washington would have thought to let more people on the air by legalizing low power radio had the pirate movement not emerged and made that its central demand there is more the fcc could be doing to let the public onto the air waves it could open more of the spectrum to broadcasting moving beyond the standard am and fm bands it could let stations broadcast even closer to each other on the spectrum moving beyond rules based on the technical standards of the 1950 's it could strip away the hefty fees and needless requirements for licenses there 's one very simple measure of how effective the government 's micro radio plan will be how many people will continue to go on the air as pirates risking fines and forfeiture of equipment now that the commission has created this new class of licenses if piracy is still flourishing this time next year that will be a sign that the new plan did not go far enough jesse walker associate editor of reason magazine is writing a book on micro radio
 to the editor re what a chancellor needs most by harold o levy op ed aug 21 the former new york city schools chancellor 's assertions that qualified teachers and parental involvement are essential ingredients in improved education is sound yet the fact that he does not mention principals and administrative accountability is most revealing a strong need in school environments is to provide a system of oversight and accountability for all authority figures without a system of checks and balances in place progressive education becomes politicized and corrupt this is something else a chancellor needs most larry hoffner new york aug 21 2002
 to the editor one problem with duty to warn by stephen gillers op ed july 26 is that it presumes as much public discussion of product safety does that there are only two kinds of products safe ones and unsafe ones the reality is that many products have risks inherent in them cars and tires to name just two and always pose a threat of harm to those who use them they are inherently unsafe to some degree no matter how well designed and each design may present its own variations of that danger imposing a duty on lawyers to warn of the risks presented by such products would compel them to make disclosures constantly rand johnson east pharsalia ny july 26 2001 the writer is a lawyer
 it is disappointing though not really surprising that smith wesson would try to retreat from some parts of its deal with the clinton administration to change the way it designs distributes and markets guns the company 's embrace of a sensible menu of safety restrictions in exchange for ending threatened lawsuits against it brought fierce criticism and financial pressure from other firearms manufacturers distributors and gun dealers but smith wesson can not change the clear meaning of the legal settlement simply by posting implausible clarifications on its web site one contested provision would require smith wesson dealers not to sell firearms at gun shows unless all sales by any seller are subjected to a full federal background check of the purchaser in its clarification smith wesson said the provision covered only firearms sold by licensed dealers not used weapons sold at gun shows by private citizens that creative reading would render the provision meaningless since licensed dealers are already required to conduct background checks it is private sales at gun shows that are currently exempt a second contested provision aims to stop bulk purchases by traffickers by limiting dealers to selling only one gun per customer on a given day and by requiring that purchasers wait 14 days before picking up guns they order on subsequent days on its web site smith wesson said the limit on bulk sales applied only to smith wesson guns and that dealers could sell multiple guns to an individual if they had been made by someone else clinton administration officials while voicing sympathy for the pressures on the gun maker insist they will enforce the agreement as written that is exactly the right tack instead of retreating the administration needs to exert pressure on other industry players to agree to similar terms by appearing to renege on its agreement smith wesson only hurts itself dozens of localities that buy guns have signed onto the campaign to protect the company from retaliatory efforts by giving a preference to smith wesson and other manufacturers that adhere to the deal 's principles but smith wesson is unlikely to reap that benefit unless it honors its side of the bargain

 no wonder george w bush looked frustrated when news of worldcom 's monster con game reached the hilltop in canada where heads of the world 's biggest economies were gathering long gone are the days when a triumphal american leader could attend these summit conferences and gloat about the superiority of our home grown capitalism even president vladimir putin of russia was moved to express grave concern about american accounting practices worldcom the telecommunications giant reported late tuesday that it had overstated its operating cash flow by 38 billion in the last five quarters by improperly booking ordinary expenses as capital expenditures to be depreciated over time even a child can understand that painting your house is not the same as building a new one but that basic concept seems to have eluded the people who were paid to keep an eye on worldcom 's books it 's no wonder that europeans are now beginning to recoil from america 's demand that the rest of the world adopt the accounting principles used in the united states coming on the heels of enron and a slew of other prominent financial scandals worldcom 's apparent fraud left washington regulators reeling as well it might in a speech on wednesday night harvey pitt chairman of the securities and exchange commission quoted the line from the movie network i 'm mad as hell and i 'm not going to take it anymore mr pitt said chief executives of major corporations would now have to certify their companies financial statements personally which is a good thing echoing the president 's vow to hold people accountable mr pitt said corporate crooks and charlatans would be doing jail time and that too is fine yet there is a lot more that mr pitt who has been accused of being much too cozy with the accounting industry could do as a policy maker one obvious move is to issue a blanket rule that auditors can not provide companies whose books they police with any other services the simple nature yet breathtaking scale of worldcom 's deceit raises anew all the enron questions about the failure of market guardians to prevent it was anyone on the board of directors even remotely suspicious why did n't the auditing firm arthur andersen realize that the company was booking false profits did high profile worldcom boosters on wall street give the company 's phony numbers a pass because they were eager to win worldcom 's banking business one positive byproduct of this seemingly endless parade of companies behaving badly could be a turnaround in congress if our elected officials have any sense of embarrassment paul sarbanes sensible accounting reform bill ought to sail through the senate and prevail over a weaker house version in conference certainly if every lawmaker who benefited from campaign contributions from now discredited companies and financial institutions votes for it it will be on president bush 's desk quicker than you can say market fundamentals in the meantime anxious investors are left to wonder what other financial scandals lie around the corner america 's status as the world 's ultimate safe haven for investors is looking shaky the huge inflow of foreign capital 400 billion a year has been a key factor in the country 's recent prosperity two fifths of all treasury bonds are in foreign hands an erosion of confidence in the united states could accelerate the dollar 's recent decline and dry up needed credit capital flight is a danger we usually associate with countries like argentina but a few more worldcoms and the comparison may seem apt we have been down this road before but there is something about the sight of billions of dollars in potential profits that makes investors forget the lessons of history in the 1920 's and 1980 's speculative run ups were followed by a painful relearning of certain basic truths breathless hype about the dawn of a new gravity defying era and accounting gimmicks are no substitute for real profits it may come as little consolation to worldcom shareholders who have lost 150 billion since the stock reached its all time high in 1999 but the flushing out of the dishonest self dealers is the first step toward a recovery
 to the editor the argument that the olympic movement might be better off if it were smaller editorial july 17 is probably correct but the reduction in size would not by itself solve problems like the use of drugs a more far reaching solution would be to embrace the modest proposal to abandon the olympic games altogether in the interest of preserving the virtues of athletic competition when athletes drug themselves it means that the overriding goal of athletics is winning this emphasis is encouraged by the fact that the olympics now feeds the spirit of chauvinistic triumphalism that infects practically every nation what counts now is how many gold medals a nation wins rather the excellence of individual performances if the professed ideals of the olympic movement and its real virtues are to be preserved then the movement must be abandoned murray hausknecht long island city queens july 17 2001 the writer is emeritus professor of sociology cuny
 to the editor re new twist on physicist 's role in nazi bomb front page feb 7 the release of the werner heisenberg niels bohr correspondence will not i fear make much of a dent in the carapace of denial that surrounds the whole question of heisenberg 's role in the german atomic bomb project and his moral conduct during the nazi era already as your article indicates the wagons are circling and preparing to say that bohr got it all wrong about his old friend that in any case heisenberg was in a difficult position and if that does n't wash that the letters from bohr are at bottom quite ambiguous unfortunately the documentary evidence in my book heisenberg and the nazi atomic bomb project showing heisenberg 's errors in his physical equations and formulas about the bomb as well as the extent of his collaboration with the nazi regime has failed to convince the apologists for heisenberg among these is michael frayn the author of copenhagen who expended much effort in trying to refute such arguments in the postscript to the printed edition of his play to quote ronald fraser the british intelligence officer in charge of heisenberg 's rehabilitation after the war all this denial and rationalization are rather pitiful in a man of heisenberg 's mental stature but there are now too many reputations tied up with the matter for any objective resolution of the issue paul lawrence rose state college pa feb 7 2002
 the very rich are different from you and me scott fitzgerald wrote so we are being reminded these days by president bush 's tax bill the rich are the main beneficiaries of the bush bill the richest 1 percent of taxpayers would get 43 percent of the money from its provisions that comes to 40000 to 50000 per family the big gainers mostly voted for mr bush and are enthusiastic about his tax bill nothing surprising about that except for one thing the bill they support could undermine the prosperity that has brought them unexampled wealth the greatest economic boom in america 's history and the world 's came in the 1990 's what made it possible just about all the experts agree on the answer president clinton turned away from deficit spending and made it his prime objective to bring the federal budget into balance that enabled the federal reserve to keep interest rates low result the boom if all the tax cuts proposed by mr bush became law the government would likely go back into the red and interest rates rise that is the unpleasant reality that he has tried to conceal by what amounts to a verbal game of three card monte mr bush talks about his 16 trillion tax cut as my new york times colleague paul krugman first pointed out it is really 2 trillion when you count increased interest the government would have to pay on its debt other costs not mentioned by president bush would bring the figure to around 25 trillion to conceal the real impact of his legislation mr bush and his budget also used fancifully low estimates of spending he assumed there would be cuts in appropriations for such things as basic science and crime fighting which congress is unlikely to make he assumed that congress would hold the annual growth of discretionary spending to an unrealistic 4 percent the economist of london pointed out that he made no allowance for population growth and hence his budget implies a drop in real spending per citizen then there is the little matter of social security and medicare the bush budget assumes that their reserves can be diverted for other uses instead of being there for the baby boomers as they retire mr bush is just as slippery when he describes the effect of his legislation on taxpayers as he is when he discusses its impact on the budget his big theme is that the average taxpayer would save 1600 a year what percentage of american taxpayers would you guess would actually get less than that 50 percent no 88 percent of taxpayers would gain less than 1600 from the bush bill the financial times of london like the economist is a journal devoted to business and to economic realism the paper 's washington bureau chief gerard baker wrote this week instead of picking out the striving teacher in the gallery of the house of representatives last week it would have been more honest if mr bush had identified the grinning investment banker or multi billionaire land owner it is the intellectual dishonesty of this approach that is most distressing for some conservative ideologues the deception in presenting the tax plan is unimportant what matters to them is starving the federal government of revenue and thus forcing it to reduce its role they are not satisfied by the fact that federal spending as a share of gross domestic product has shrunk about 20 percent in the last decade most americans conservative or liberal want the federal government to do most of what it does they would like a tax cut but give that a lower priority according to surveys than safeguarding social security reducing the national debt and spending for domestic purposes generally to me the mystery is why non ideological conservatives men and women who have made their way in business and the professions should support the extravagant bush tax plan rather than a more cautious alternative sure they may save some thousands of dollars a year in the short run but they have so much at risk in a policy that calculatedly underestimates the cost of the tax cuts and endangers the hard won federal budget surplus that has opened the way to prosperity in the greek fable the goose laid a golden egg every day its owner wanting all the treasure at once killed the goose and looked inside he found the inside of a goose

 to the editor re judicial nominee advances amid dispute over religion news article july 24 republicans assert that the democrats are trying to exclude anyone who is a good catholic from serving on the federal bench because good catholics like william pryor jr oppose abortion the objection to mr pryor the alabama attorney general who has been nominated to a federal appeals court is that in a number of cases he seems to place another set of beliefs above the united states constitution in making his decisions the source of that set of beliefs is not the issue the suggestion that good catholics would want to infuse their judicial decisions with the teachings of their church is frighteningly reminiscent of the accusations in 1960 that john f kennedy would take his direction from the vatican not the electorate or the constitution the republicans argument is profoundly anti catholic bob halstead farmington hills mich july 24 2003

 to the editor to get out of the current mess we need a third party to mediate between al gore and george w bush front page nov 11 as in other conflicts each side may at first have had a limit as to how far it would go but as the other side reacted a vicious circle of escalation began with each side reacting to the other to stop a party trusted by both sides can find out at what point it is willing to stop if the other side agrees to do the same after all both sides realize that continued escalation poses danger to each of them and to the country the third party must not be a partisan like jimmy carter any nonpartisan experienced mediator may do there is little to be lost by trying and a lot to be gained if it works amitai etzioni washington nov 11 2000 the writer is university professor at george washington university

 circumstances have changed dramatically since president bush first proposed his tax cut last year the economy has slowed down with recession a distinct possibility but in the long term official budget surplus projections have risen from 3 trillion to almost 6 trillion in fact if the congressional budget office were not using overly pessimistic assumptions about revenue growth surplus projections would actually be about one third larger or more than 8 trillion over the coming decade the additional 2 trillion of surplus revenue would therefore easily accommodate a substantial expansion of the tax rate reductions currently under consideration quite simply the federal government is awash in surpluses and will remain so even after president bush 's tax cut barring a major economic contraction it would not be unreasonable for mr bush to seek tax rate reductions twice the size of what he has proposed the bush administration has done a marvelous job of presenting the arguments for the president 's proposal but by locking itself into a 16 trillion reduction and devoting a large amount of the surpluses to debt retirement the administration has fallen behind the curve as circumstances have changed even if one has confidence that congress will devote every penny of the additional surpluses to debt retirement which i do not it will run out of debt to retire even faster than already projected then within a very few years we would confront the highly undesirable situation of the government having to invest those surpluses in private assets ie the stock market that is why alan greenspan told congress a crash course to retire the national debt is not the best fiscal policy for the nation contrary to misconceptions on capitol hill among both parties rushing to retire the national debt will not lower interest rates they are higher today than they were in 1993 when deficits were around 4 percent of gross domestic product neither will debt reduction increase national savings debt retirement does not strengthen social security debt reduction does not promote economic growth economic growth reduces the burden of debt although the debt held by the public rose from 24 trillion in 1990 to 36 trillion in 1999 the debt burden on the economy actually fell from 424 percent of gross domestic product to 419 percent because the economy grew faster than the debt during the same period and high tax rates do not promote growth they stifle it the president 's political capital for tax cuts may now be as high as it will get he needs to invest it in a push for broader and deeper tax reductions and reforms waiting will only make it harder for him to achieve comprehensive simplification of our confusing and counterproductive tax code of course i recognize the constraints and political uncertainties a new president faces and i would not second guess mr bush 's decision to deliver on the tax cut plan he made during his campaign before reaching for more however i believe it is essential for him to send the nation an unambiguous signal in his upcoming address to congress that this year 's tax cut is just the first step to rate reductions each year from here on out i hope the president pledges to make fundamental tax reform and simplification a keystone of his administration that means creating a system that applies a low tax rate on all taxpayers protects taxpayer rights and stops collection abuses ends the multiple taxation of saving and investment and imposes rules to ensure substantial consensus before taxes are raised by congress tax reform is never easy but it will be easier now than later and better for the economy finally a reminder to my republican friends in congress do n't negotiate with yourselves you 'll lose jack kemp is a co director of empower america

 the senate judiciary committee is expected to vote this week on president bush 's nomination of judge d brooks smith to the third circuit court of appeals in philadelphia we have serious concerns about judge smith 's interpretation of the constitution his fairness in employment discrimination and other cases against large companies and his judicial ethics we urge the committee to reject his nomination as a trial judge judge smith has been reversed by the third circuit the court he now seeks to join more than 50 times too often it has been for wrongly dismissing the claims of workers and consumers in one overturned ruling he threw out an age discrimination case filed by a factory worker on timeliness grounds although the worker had made the 300 day deadline from the time he was dismissed judge smith counted back from the day he had received a poor performance evaluation in another case in which he was reversed judge smith was too quick to throw out a suit by the parents of a 15 month old child who choked to death on what the parents alleged was a dangerous toy he has taken an extremely narrow view of congress 's power to legislate under the commerce clause which has often been used to pass laws protecting civil rights if the commerce clause were reduced to what judge smith says the founders intended little more than an authorization to eliminate trade barriers blacks women and other groups that have relied on the protections afforded them under the mainstream interpretation of the clause would be stripped of important rights equally troubling is judge smith 's expansive reading of the fifth amendment 's takings clause which is increasingly popular with property owners challenging health and safety and environmental regulations in a case involving the coal industry retiree health benefit act judge smith ruled that forcing a company to pay benefits that retired miners had rightfully earned would constitute an illegal taking of the company 's property an interpretation other courts have roundly rejected judge smith 's record also contains significant ethical lapses one case that he presided over for a time and issued orders in involved a bank in which his wife was an officer and in which he and his wife had 100000 or more in stock under federal law he had an obligation to recuse himself since his impartiality might reasonably be questioned when judge smith was up for confirmation to the trial court he conceded that his membership in the all male spruce creek rod and gun club violated the code of conduct for judges and promised the senate that if he was unable to persuade it to open its doors to women he would resign instead he remained in the club for more than a decade although it continued all that time to discriminate judge smith 's defenders accuse senate democrats of wanting to reject or delay acting on all of president bush 's nominees judiciary committee members should not be intimidated by those charges the fact is the senate has quietly confirmed 57 nominees since last july including nine for federal appeals courts the concern about judge smith is not that he is a bush nominee but that his record shows him to be unqualified for the appellate bench his nomination should be rejected
 to the editor the july 5 front page news article about the recent decline in the availability of private lawyers to handle appeals of capital cases is disturbing but we should not draw the wrong lesson the obligation to ensure that everyone sentenced to death has competent counsel is a public obligation private charity is a wonderful thing but if there is not enough private charity to meet a public need the fault is not with private charity the fault is with the public authorities who are unwilling to meet their obligations it seems that the public or at least its elected leaders wants the death penalty but does not want to pay for the lawyers who are essential in our adversarial system to fairness in imposing the death penalty michael winger new york july 5 2001

 to the editor re death is different editorial april 10 having handled criminal appeals for 35 years throughout the country i am convinced that those who face the death penalty often secure a better level of justice than others within the criminal justice system in many states more qualified lawyers are appointed to represent death penalty defendants and more seasoned prosecutors are more reluctant to proceed unless they have a higher quality of evidence not deemed necessary in other cases it is easier to persuade law students to work on a death penalty case and to secure volunteers from large law firms to give their time pro bono in death penalty cases judges review the cases with greater care and errors that may have affected the evidence are considered more significant in death penalty cases if as you report a hundred innocent people were facing death in this country since 1973 think of the hundreds of thousands of innocent people who received other albeit lesser sentences on the basis of a broken system nathan z dershowitz new york april 15 2002

 to the editor re toward universal coverage editorial sept 24 you rightly call for the expanded use of refundable tax credits such a program could easily work without causing excessive national expense if four principles were adopted first an individual health insurance mandate must be adopted as all americans possess a basic responsibility to themselves and society to be covered aided by obvious government financial subsidies second this mandate should be modest in scope and based on a defined contribution of perhaps 1000 per individual so as to not encourage employers to drop their current level of coverage third the minimum wage should be fixed by adding a 50 cent an hour health insurance component fourth government imposed mandated insurance benefits should be relaxed solely for the uninsured to allow for the sale of bare bones policies kenneth s abramowitz new york sept 25 2000 the writer is a health care analyst
 to the editor gail collins column may 8 contrasts the focus on developing a missile shield with the more mundane threat of a nuclear bomb carried on a cargo ship or the back of a truck ms collins echoes a concern first expressed more than 60 years ago by albert einstein in his famous letter of aug 2 1939 to president franklin d roosevelt einstein warned that a single nuclear bomb carried by boat and exploded in a port might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory perhaps we should listen to einstein before it 's too late harvey boulay norfolk mass may 8 2001
 to the editor alfred s posamentier 's assertion that a differentiated salary schedule or a salary scale would improve the quality of teachers is fraught with problems op ed june 5 how are we to determine which teachers should receive greater pay higher degrees and more education do not necessarily translate into quality teaching standardized test scores are questionable in terms of growth and progress administrative oversight brings political patronage to the process the difficulty in assessing quality teaching makes differentiated salary scales impractical larry hoffner new york june 5 2003 the writer is a high school english teacher
 to the editor hilary ballon for some students early decision is best op ed dec 18 focuses on how early decision should work instead of on how it is actually practiced previously when universities accepted a small proportion of their class early students with clear objectives benefited as ms ballon describes now however with schools accepting 40 percent or more of their enrollments through early decision students must choose very carefully or risk being closed out this system encourages mediocrity favors elitism and puts the college selection process into the hands of capricious college admission officers instead of in the hands of the students as the father of a high school senior i side with the president of yale who wants to end early decision admissions william bintzer mamaroneck ny dec 18 2001
 to the editor we should all concur with nikolay palchikoff 's plea op ed aug 6 to prevent atrocities like hiroshima the first step is to understand that we and the russians still have thousands of nuclear warheads on hair trigger alert ready for launching on a few minutes notice this means that 10 years after the cold war we are still minutes from nuclear incineration by far more powerful nuclear bombs than laid waste to hiroshima we may be in even greater danger today from an accidental missile launching because of the deterioration of the russian nuclear command structure and early warning system the greatest gift that we can give to the future is to ensure that all nuclear weapons are taken off alert status and placed in storage depots to be inspected by officials from all nuclear powers and the united nations leading to their complete abolition douglas mattern san francisco aug 6 2001
 to the editor re woman 's death after raid is officially ruled homicide news article may 28 many drug raids involve crashing into apartments and a lot of apartments look alike given all the resources and risks that a raid involves it makes a lot of sense to do some double checks and verifications before carrying out a violent forced entry operation the new search warrant database is a step in the right direction but i hope that it has a lot of room set aside for information on location as this tragedy shows innocent lives depend on it james j romanowski lackawanna ny may 29 2003
 post terror nerves aside what mainly ails the us economy is too much of a good thing during the bubble years businesses overspent on capital equipment the resulting overhang of excess capacity is a drag on investment and hence a drag on the economy as a whole in time this overhang will be worked off meanwhile economic policy should encourage other spending to offset the temporary slump in business investment low interest rates which promote spending on housing and other durable goods are the main answer but it seems inevitable that there will also be a fiscal stimulus package that package should include only measures that really will promote spending now when the economy needs it it should n't include anything that worsens the long run budget position more than is necessary or anything that looks like hitchhiking exploiting the short run difficulties of the economy to pursue unrelated long run goals unfortunately the bush administration has just taken a big step away from those principles until late last week it looked as if much of any stimulus package would consist of increased government spending to rebuild new york to pay for military operations and to provide unemployment benefits this would put money into the economy in a clearly temporary way giving money to lower income families would also be sensible the problem with temporary tax breaks is that you ca n't be sure people will spend them in fact the much vaunted rebate seems to have gone mainly into the bank rather than the economy the chances are better if the money goes to poorer people whose spending is often constrained by simple lack of cash but the big ticket items in the stimulus proposal sketched out by administration officials on thursday and reaffirmed by george w bush after a meeting with congressional hard liners are thoroughly wrongheaded and they suggest that bipartisanship is over that we 're back to the cynical budget politics of the past one key proposal is a permanent new tax break for business investment this violates the basic principle that stimulus proposals should be only short term furthermore it would probably have only a modest effect on business investment now when there is excess capacity but it would increase long term interest rates by increasing both future deficits and future business borrowing and since long term interest rates are what matter for housing on balance this measure might well delay recovery instead of promoting it another key administration proposal is an acceleration of tax cuts for higher income brackets that under current law are not scheduled to happen for several years on the face of it this idea seems bizarre it gives money to precisely the people who are least likely to spend it is this just a case of knee jerk conservatism of the belief that tax cuts for the affluent are the answer to all problems alas no it 's worse than that the real reason to accelerate the bush tax cut is surely to forestall the growing likelihood that part of that tax cut will eventually be rescinded over the last couple of months the long run budget outlook has darkened dramatically we 've gone from arguments about whether the social security surplus would be raided to the prospect of deficits plain and simple as far as the eye can see a natural response once the slowdown is over would be to cancel some or all of the tax cuts mainly for upper brackets that are scheduled to happen in 2004 and beyond as a political matter that will be much harder to do if the cuts have already gone into effect and that surely is why the administration wants to accelerate the tax cut it 's being billed as a short run stimulus proposal but it 's really a case of covert hitchhiking to add to the insult a preliminary analysis of the numbers suggests that fuzzy math is back the administration appears to be greatly understating the true budget cost of its proposals and pretending that a package that consists overwhelmingly of tax cuts is evenly split between tax cuts and spending as far as one can tell the ultimate shape of the fiscal stimulus package is still fluid the package that eventually emerges could be genuinely designed to help the economy or it could be mainly a vehicle for political opportunism sadly the latter possibility has just become much more likely

 a half century ago this week my late older brother len who was an associate producer of the brand new television show today pressed his nbc bosses to unshackle the show from the studio he had this idea of using the latest video technology to do remotes live pictures from scenes as far as a few miles away one remote was a tone poem about dawn over manhattan seen from a beautiful bridge over the hudson but len overslept that morning unshaven he threw a robe over his pajamas and hailed a cab shouting take me to the middle of the george washington bridge the cabbie took him to a police station instead that nutty incident became tv legend recounted in paddy chayefsky 's movie network at that time in 1952 i was a buck private in the us army spending a couple of months in a manhattan public information office between basic training and shipment overseas my lieutenant thought it would reflect well on the army if the new today show to commemorate the fourth of july televised a medal presentation i pitched it to lenny at nbc who started to turn it down but then thought of a live remote could you do it on bedloe 's island with the statue of liberty in the background i said sure he told me to get a general to pin the medal on a war hero at 7 am repeating it at 8 and again at the end of the show just before 9 but the lieutenant pointed out that that could n't be done when a medal was presented that was it you could n't take it back and present it again even for tv so we looked for a couple of other heroes scheduled to receive medals that month he found them and two other generals eager to make the award and we set up three ceremonies trouble was one of the recipients was to get the distinguished service cross the brass at governors island said that required an honor guard and where that guard went the first army band followed i told my brother we would need nbc to spring for a ferry to take a 30 man honor guard and a 40 piece band and three generals and their staffs from governors island to the statue of liberty 's island also at the same ungodly hour of 5 am we 'd need another ferry to take the three medal recipients and the 20 or so members of their families from manhattan 's south ferry slip to rendezvous at the statue lenny said pat weaver of nbc could afford the troop movement in the predawn fourth the announcer frank blair a flashlight in one hand and a mike in the other was lining up the generals and the recipients in the dark i was in the mobile unit 's control booth with the director and lenny was with dave garroway in the manhattan studio as the today show began to televise the presentation of a bronze star my lieutenant called he put me on with a commander in the navy 's public information office i do n't want to horn in on an army project said the commander but i was watching this event on television and it so happens we have an essex class aircraft carrier in the upper bay at the moment on another line i called lenny and asked can you use an aircraft carrier sure he said tell the captain to run it past the statue of liberty as we come up to 8 o'clock we 'll swing our cameras around to pick it up it was then that i a private not yet first class in a thurberian voice like thin ice breaking gave the command never before given either in naval history or in the new world of mass communications cue the carrier on their small screens today 's viewers saw the hero step forward the band played the anthem the general awarded the medal the honor guard fired off its rifles the proud families wiped tears from their eyes the director superimposed the waving american flag over the massive torch of miss liberty then dissolved to the 27000 ton ship steaming majestically by sailors lined up on deck saluting my brother and i were all choked up in the rush of patriotic fervor it was a vivid lesson to everyone involved even when stage managed to evoke an emotional response coverage of a live event at the scene of its happening could take on a life of its own surprising and stirring participants on both sides of the camera this is some medium lenny breathed those 50 years ago e mail safire nytimescom
 to the editor re wait a minute mr postman new yorkers take their mail cautiously if at all news article nov 12 while no single approach will end the threat of terrorism through the mail one way to simplify matters is to reduce the volume of mail that must be examined or cleansed a good way to accomplish that is to give mail recipients the right to opt out of receiving mail other than first class and subscription publications direct marketers as well as post office officials can cite the profits junk mail produces profits that theoretically hold down first class costs but given the added cost in both money and time of inspecting and somehow purifying mail the idea of getting rid of tons of junk mail every day is an attractive one that merits serious consideration walter gray mount kisco ny nov 12 2001
 to the editor dennis ross op ed june 26 and the bush administration persist in the belief that there is a political solution to the middle east but a political solution does not exist or if it does exist no one has ever been able to find the magic formula perhaps a solution lies in economics not a free market approach but an organized development effort across all of palestine and the rest of the middle east organized by the united states the saudis and the kuwaitis this would include clean water new housing construction new schools sufficient electricity and new roads perhaps when the palestinians have something to lose they will tone down the political rhetoric and build a lasting relationship with their prosperous neighbor then perhaps the political rhetoric and the violence will be toned down to a point where a political settlement is possible william m pinzler new york june 26 2002
 to the editor re morgan stanley says it 'clearly made a mistake by inviting clinton to speak news article feb 11 faced with a few dozen unhappy clients philip j purcell the chairman of morgan stanley says he made a mistake when he asked former president bill clinton to speak at a conference so he joined the current storm of media criticism of mr clinton my grandfather walter hoving would have responded differently during his 25 year tenure as chairman of tiffany company many customers took great exception to some of the controversial positions he took in his tiffany editorial advertisements unlike mr purcell my grandfather would have stood by his decision instead of cowering before a few clients threatening to close their accounts when threats of this nature came across my grandfather 's desk he simply closed the accounts for them john hoving new york feb 12 2001
 to the editor re as endowments slip at colleges big tuition increases fill the void front page feb 22 understandably the staggering economy has affected our private colleges and universities but raising tuition so much is not the answer speaking from a student 's standpoint i can say that our lives too have been dramatically altered because of the changes in the economy and we are in no position to fill the void for these schools college tuition and expenses are extremely high to begin with and significant increases will make higher education only further out of reach for average middle class families nina hernandez flushing queens feb 25 2002
 to the editor robert d reischauer when more means less op ed july 16 calls attention to one of the defining characteristics of medicare its universality and argues cogently that it must be preserved the sad fact is that there are too few elements of our modern society that we all expect to experience similarly and medicare and social security are the most prominent among public programs apart from the tangible benefits these two programs provide they also help preserve and even strengthen the sense of community that is central to a society as large and diverse as ours without it civility and respect for others on which democracy depends will be even more threatened than it already is stephen m davidson boston july 16 2003
 to the editor re legislators approve web list disclosing missteps by doctors front page june 24 keeping tabs on doctors competence is reasonable but publicizing their malpractice records may not be in the public 's interest as it is many doctors order more tests and consultations than are necessary actions that greatly increase the cost of health care to deter the notoriety of a malpractice suit thus it is possible that making their records public will encourage them to practice even more defensively thereby subjecting patients to unnecessary and potentially dangerous medical treatments and procedures it makes more sense to have a federal agency working through state medical societies oversee doctors competence and enforce remedial education when necessary edward j volpintesta md bethel conn june 24 2000
 the republican convention in philadelphia set aside its nurturing themes about children last night and returned to the traditional gop territory of defense policy and military strength popular war heroes like former senator bob dole and gen norman schwarzkopf implied that the clinton administration had let veterans down and allowed defenses to erode but a strangely subdued note was struck by the keynote speaker senator john mccain the self described distant runner up his generous but obviously unenthusiastic praise of gov george w bush was punctuated with intimations of his own mortality his maudlin address seemed designed to echo gen douglas macarthur 's farewell and perhaps to suggest a subtext of i shall return if mr bush falters in november keynote speeches are usually aimed at firing up the crowd mr mccain 's passive approach flattened the already placid mood of the convention few delegates were likely to be convinced by his praise of the prospective nominee as my friend moreover mr mccain a former prisoner of war in vietnam described a convoluted generational and military link to the texas governor by asserting that his grandfather had been former president george bush 's commander in world war ii then he conceded that it is my turn to serve under the son of my grandfather 's brave subordinate before one of the most tranquilizing keynote addresses in modern convention history the podium last night seemed like a kind of class reunion for the gulf war it was a tableau with certain pitfalls as well as advantages for governor bush like the choice of former defense secretary dick cheney as his running mate the evening reminded the audience that the war was the high point of mr bush 's father 's term in the white house without offering much of a suggestion about the policies of another bush presidency some listeners might also recall that as a senator from tennessee al gore broke with many democrats and supported the war the idea that military spending suddenly declined under president clinton is also based partly on myth the pentagon budget began declining under president bush and has risen in recent years under mr clinton and his republican defense secretary convention speeches are not to be confused with subtle foreign policy pronouncements but there has been a certain confusion about republican declarations on foreign policy that mr bush will eventually have to clear up the most extensive statements on the subject have come from the governor 's main foreign policy adviser condoleezza rice who also spoke at the convention last night her criticism of the administration is that it has spent too much time on trivial humanitarian interests and failed to deal seriously with potential rivals like china and russia or cultivate major allies cooperating with allies sounds good in principle but mr bush seems determined to embark on a risky missile defense system that major european allies regard as unworkable the republican convention as it has in all things has papered over cleavages within the domestic ranks on foreign policy mr bush had to repudiate his own congressional leadership early this year when he called for support of american peacekeeping efforts in kosovo sorting these issues out will come only when vice president gore gets a chance to challenge mr bush after the conventions all that americans learned last night was the importance of military strength how that strength is to be used will have to be elucidated in the campaign to come
 to the editor re gore and lieberman make tolerance the centerpiece front page aug 9 watching the coverage of al gore 's selection of joseph i lieberman as his running mate i was happy to see mr lieberman 's religious faith portrayed in a positive way with all the focus on a candidate 's religion however one can not help but remember a similar situation handled much differently earlier in the presidential race when gov george w bush in response to a question said his favorite philosopher was jesus some said mr bush was exploiting religion to get votes perhaps those who condemned mr bush have since changed their views on how a candidate should express his religious beliefs and they therefore celebrate mr lieberman 's convictions or perhaps they apply a double standard when democrats speak of their faith and when republicans do the same john p alexander manhasset ny aug 9 2000

 to the editor your dec 30 front page article bold effort leaves much unchanged for the poor was crucial in informing readers about how efforts to change the welfare system have done little to change the lives of poor people in this country today but perhaps it is time that we as a country admit that doing away with welfare does nothing more than appease those who resent the sustaining of any group at the expense of taxpayers perhaps too we should accept that education must now serve a more pro active role in the lives of children who grow up in impoverished situations whenever we make a bold investment in education that is based on the individual needs of students we can expect results that will change the plight of the poor education must make up for parents failures cody lyon new york dec 30 1999

 to the editor re generous to a fault op ed march 21 by amy domini and thomas van dyck while it is true that foundations are required to spend a minimum of 5 percent of their assets each year and that these assets have been rapidly growing over the last several years a higher percentage of expenditure should not be mandated foundations should maintain a wise and prudent investment and expenditure philosophy keeping their long term missions firmly in place the 5 percent minimum does not preclude a nonprofit from additional expenditures and as the writers note many do finance above this limit any government intervention should be limited to incentives and encouragement not new shortsighted regulations that could hamper future activities scott schirmer st louis march 21 2000

 to the editor the may 23 news article about the boycott of merck company products that has been called by the federation of physicians and dentists underscores why allowing doctors to form cartels to raise prices boycott drug companies and national health plans and deny medical services to patients is a bad prescription for our country 's health care inflated doctors bills higher premiums and fewer benefits wo n't help working families meet their health care needs but that 's what we 'll get if congress passes an anti competitive bill hr 1304 granting doctors the same collective bargaining rights enjoyed by unions but without government protections to prevent predatory pricing practices collusion pricing is illegal under antitrust laws and the federal trade commission has recently stepped in to break up doctor cartels in wisconsin and texas do we want to repeat that experience in all 50 states thomas j donohue pres us chamber of commerce washington may 23 2000
 to the editor re al gore as fall programming by gail collins column aug 18 ms collins suggests that al gore may be the first episode of joanie loves chachi to bill clinton 's happy days but not every tv spinoff is a weak rehash of a tired original destined for audience rejection the clear intention of the democratic national convention this year and the selection of joseph i lieberman as mr gore 's running mate was to persuade the public that a different supporting cast and a new outlook will enable this second banana to headline a new show successfully put differently the goal is to portray al gore not as a chachi but more like a frasier or a rhoda or a george jefferson we will have to keep tuning in to find out whether this casting concept survives the political equivalent of the november ratings sweeps barry langman new york aug 18 2000
 recently i gave the bipartisan commission on social security reform many of its members and staff are actually associated with the ultra conservative cato institute a very hard time over its interim report was i unfair no it 's even worse than i thought i had been trying to come up with a reductio ad absurdum something that would demonstrate how nonsensical the commission 's analysis is but i need n't have bothered a commission member thomas saving did the job for me in a presentation he gave at cato he repeated the report 's claim that the trust fund accumulated through decades of social security surpluses is no help when it comes to paying future benefits but he was more specific the trust fund is worthless he said because it is invested in us government bonds if it were invested in german bonds the trust fund could indeed be used to pay benefits let 's see last year the social security system collected about 90 billion more in payroll taxes than it paid in benefits mr saving says that if that money had been invested in german bonds it would have made a real contribution to the system 's future but because it was used to buy us bonds it somehow disappeared into a black hole is he saying that last year 's social security surplus did not enhance the government 's future ability to pay benefits if so he 's just plain wrong last year the government paid off more than 200 billion in debt to the public largely because of the social security surplus and lower debt implies lower future interest payments which means that the government can pay more in benefits without raising taxes or cutting other spending or is he saying that future administrations will not allow the social security administration to apply the interest on its us bonds to benefit payments that 's possible but future administrations could also with equal ease snatch the interest on german bonds and use it for something else neither prospect seems likely mr saving is a competent economist he 's a professor at texas am but i ca n't see any way to make economic sense of his argument it makes sense only as part of a political strategy the rest of the political strategy became apparent when representatives jim kolbe republican of arizona and charles stenholm a texas democrat introduced a bill to create private investment accounts within social security it was n't a good bill but at least the sponsors admitted that such accounts could not be created without tax increases and benefit cuts anyone that tells you there is a painless way to fix social security simply is n't telling the whole truth declared mr kolbe that 's an interesting remark was n't there a presidential candidate who promised gain without pain from the creation of private accounts as i remember his slogan was it 's your money sure enough the bush administration wasted no time denouncing the kolbe stenholm bill for suggesting that there might be any downside to social security privatization the bill 's sponsors had described themselves as canaries in a mine testing the atmosphere after the administration 's rejection one might say betrayal mr stenholm was bitter we were hoping to be the mine canaries but we were n't expecting to be shot by the owners of the mine on the way down the shaft but now the administration 's political strategy is clear it is not interested in a realistic proposal for privatizing social security it intends to sell private accounts with false advertising with the promise of something for nothing and the administration is equally uninterested in a realistic assessment of the current social security system instead it will attempt to scare people with the threat of pain without gain of nothing for something that is with the help of the commission the administration will try to convince people that the huge surpluses of today 's social security system somehow make no contribution to the system 's future solvency one might ask why it has to be this way is the actual case for privatization so weak that its advocates dare not tell the truth or has the administration concluded after its successful mendacity on the tax cut that dishonesty is always the best policy in any case let 's not pretend that we are having a real honest discussion the privatizers know what they want and they will say anything no matter how untrue in order to get it
