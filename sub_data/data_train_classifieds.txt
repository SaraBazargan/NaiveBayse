 representative richard a gephardt 's push to win the endorsement of the afl cio which is important to his hopes of winning the democratic presidential nomination has been set back by his problems raising money and his low standing in some polls many union leaders say mr gephardt of missouri has far more individual union endorsements than any of the other eight democratic candidates but to win the labor federation 's endorsement he needs the backing of unions representing two thirds of its 13 million members two thirds is a very tough and high mountain to climb said gerald w mcentee chairman of the afl cio 's political committee and president of the american federation of state county and municipal employees my own judgment is that right now he does n't have two thirds can he reach the two thirds it 's a possibility but i think it 's very challenging and difficult securing the afl cio 's endorsement before the primaries could give mr gephardt a major leg up political experts say because it would place at his disposal hundreds of union campaign workers already assigned to congressional districts across the nation all nine democratic presidential candidates are scheduled to debate tuesday in chicago before the afl cio 's executive council the council will not consider an endorsement this week federation officials say but mr gephardt 's backers hope that he can win the group 's endorsement at a meeting in october he very much would like the afl cio endorsement said steven elmendorf a senior adviser to the gephardt campaign even if we do n't get the endorsement a majority of unions will endorse gephardt he added there 's zero chance that any other candidate is going to get endorsed by the afl many union leaders question whether mr gephardt can obtain the needed two thirds majority hurting his chances several union presidents say is that three of the nation 's largest and most politically active unions the state county and municipal employees the service employees international union and the american federation of teachers appear unlikely to endorse mr gephardt any time soon the state county and municipal employees are leaning toward senator john kerry of massachusetts while the service employees and teachers say they are not ready to decide because they are still polling their members those unions represent nearly a third of the afl cio 's membership nine unions including the international association of machinists and aerospace workers the international union of bricklayers and allied craftworkers and the seafarers international union have already endorsed mr gephardt the unions that have endorsed him represented slightly more than one million members and then mr gephardt received a highly important endorsement friday when the executive board of the teamsters union which has 14 million members voted to support him bret caldwell the teamsters communications director said the union 's president james p hoffa would officially announce the endorsement in detroit next saturday mr hoffa will fly with mr gephardt to iowa the site of the first caucus and new hampshire the site of the first primary to speak on mr gephardt 's behalf a longtime union political official who insisted on anonymity said from the beginning there have been two schools of thought in the labor movement the gephardt loyalists and the pragmatists the pragmatists have been asking the question from the beginning can he win there is a reluctance some of them are pulling back a little bit certainly the money thing did n't help only two candidates have ever received the federation 's endorsement before the primaries vice president al gore in 2000 and walter mondale then a former vice president in 1984 when the decision was made to endorse gore who was a sitting vice president with him facing just one challenger it was still very tough to get to two thirds said steve rosenthal the afl cio 's former political director among union leaders there is a consensus that mr gephardt has the best record on labor issues that is one reason so many union leaders were concerned about his lackluster fund raising he raised just 38 million in the second quarter talking about mr gephardt 's fund raising bruce s raynor president of the union of needletrades industrial and textile employees said i would be less concerned about that than the question of the ability of a candidate to defeat george bush working families need george bush to be defeated we need a viable candidate to do that
 if a last minute provision in the senate farm bill becomes law irradiated hamburger could become known by a more appealing name pasteurized beef senator tom harkin the iowa democrat who heads the senate agriculture committee said today that he had inserted the provision in an effort to more clearly define pasteurization the process by which disease producing bacteria have long been destroyed in some foods through heating the harkin change would define irradiation as a kind of pasteurization it has been sought for several years by the growing irradiated food industry which argues that irradiation is a cold pasteurization and deserves to be referred to as such but neither the food and drug administration nor the agriculture department has yet to agree that meat treated by radiation a process approved by the government two years ago should qualify as pasteurized food safety advocates argue that the legislative provision is an effort to avoid fda regulatory procedures that would ordinarily be needed in order to define irradiation as a form of pasteurization for labeling purposes both the industry and mr harkin deny any such end run mr harkin 's home state is also home in sioux city to the main plant of the surebeam corporation the no 1 irradiator of ground beef sold in the united states he inserted the provision almost three weeks ago on the last day of senate debate on the farm bill the provision was later discovered by the public interest lobby public citizen in another late change mr harkin also inserted a clause that would forbid the agriculture secretary to keep irradiated food out of the school lunch program or any other federal nutrition program only the senate version of the bill includes those provisions the legislation is now in a house senate conference and it is uncertain whether the clauses will survive the two sides in the food safety debate agree that when consumers see irradiation on a label they often view it as a warning that the product has undergone a potentially dangerous process irradiation is something the consumer associates with wartime and bombs and bad things said diane toops food and trend editor of food processing a trade magazine that views irradiation favorably and since sept 11 the process has become associated with anthrax as well because irradiation is now used to kill germs in the postal system while mr harkin played down the effect of his last minute changes consumer advocates said the provision on irradiation 's definition could allow irradiated food to be labeled pasteurized without fda action under current regulations the label on irradiated meat must instead state that it has been treated by irradiation and must be marked with the symbol for irradiation called a radura it would be terrible just horrible misleading the public about what industry is doing to its food said joan claybrook president of public citizen wil williams spokesman for the surebeam corporation said that senator harkin was simply coming up with one standard definition and that surebeam had no intention of skirting the regulatory process irradiation is pasteurization partial sterilization to eliminate pathogens mr williams said all the farm bill does is come up with a standard everyone can use since irradiation was approved by the government two years ago he said it has been used to remove germs from millions of pounds of beef a spokesman for agriculture secretary ann m veneman had no comment on the harkin provisions

 for those who pay attention to such things there is change afoot at the indian point nuclear plants correction make that the indian point energy center in the process of taking over the plants the entergy corporation has been replacing the nuclear part of the name with the more generic some might say more innocuous energy center a sign with the new title went up last fall outside the main entrance of the plants which are in buchanan about 35 miles north of midtown manhattan and in the past month the name has surfaced in a series of newspaper and radio advertisements intended to reassure the public about the safety of indian point 's nuclear operations in one recent newspaper ad for instance readers were urged to take confidence in the security of indian point energy center jim steets a spokesman for entergy said the name change reflected the company 's plan to eventually add a gas turbine to the site and to integrate what had been two separate nuclear plant operations under different owners entergy bought indian point 3 from the new york power authority in 2000 and indian point 2 from consolidated edison in september it was an important message to our employees that we were one site one team he said it was really about the integration of the sites rather than coming up with a name that was more palatable but some critics say that entergy is trying to downplay its nuclear operations in reaction to widespread concerns over safety since the sept 11 terror attacks corporations like to find ways to explain to people that castor oil is really honey said state assemblyman richard l brodsky this is the kind of thing that general electric tried to do with pcb 's in the hudson mr steets has denied any such motive calling the criticisms naive and overly suspicious indian point only means one thing to anyone who 's been involved or lived in westchester he said it was n't like we were trying to fool them into thinking we were a solar generated plant indian point is not the only nuclear plant seeking a makeover the millstone nuclear power station in waterford conn recently shortened its name to millstone power station while washington nuclear project 2 near richland wash was rechristened the columbia generating station among the other plants without a nuclear in sight is the susquehanna steam electric station near berwick pa it 's not unusual not to have nuclear in the name said diane screnci a spokeswoman for the federal nuclear regulatory commission but in the commission 's records at least the official name of the indian point plants remains the indian point nuclear generating unit 2 and unit 3 in the end of course a name change is just that a nuclear plant by any other name is still a nuclear plant harry di pietro 65 a storeowner in buchanan who supports nuclear energy said he would continue to call it just indian point i know what it is whatever they call it he said it does n't really matter what 's in a name anyway

 i was in my second year of college when i dropped out to chase a boy over to europe i hardly knew him the idle rumor that he had once said he liked me provided enough spark to ignite the journey carefully i laid my plans i wrote my parents of my unhappiness with school the lack of challenge my need for a break i scrounged the air fare i found a job waiting tables in a ski hotel outside innsbruck crammed berlitz german then dropped the fellow a casual line where he was studying in vienna i happened to be on the continent i wrote in case he was n't doing much and could use a traveling companion did it work gentle reader i fear it did in her travel writer 's romance my dream of you the irish novelist nuala o'faolain writes right at the end of my mind there was a golden blur this blur was love or hugo or passion no matter what i was thinking or doing talking to a boy in the queue and letting him buy me a cup of coffee reading the wonderfully glamorous place names on the sides of the wagons lit carriages on the platform at calais all the time the center of me was immobile rapt in front of that golden light when i count how many times i have enlisted travel in the service of that light i blush with the shame of a lesson unlearned several lessons in fact for there is traveling to find love traveling to fix love and traveling to feed love and each works on the heart in mysterious ways once i had landed my college quarry we joined forces to trace the castle building adventures of mad king ludwig we roamed up to berlin and back down to munich in a foggy black forest he taught me to whistle the only gift he gave me our sleeping arrangements ran the gamut from separate men 's and women 's hostel quarters to the narrow lobby benches of a sold out hotel in sold out frankfurt to a shared feather bed near mozart 's birthplace in salzburg like victor hugo 's daughter adele who followed an indifferent french officer to the new world i traveled with hope in my luggage every morning i woke believing the bright tulips or the crusty strudel would unlock the door to romance and then i lost him having run low on funds i bid my beloved auf wiedersehen and let him take a solo trip to prague while i earned a few more tips and planned to meet him a week later in amsterdam i knew somehow as the train chugged out of sight that i would never see this wayward boy again and i thought then that the whole trip had been a terrible waste of my time my money my passion if salzburg could n't get a man to fall in love with you i reasoned what could traveling to find love may not always be a doomed prospect my cousin mimi met her husband eurailing and any number of cruises use the possibility of shipboard romance as a chief draw but traveling to fix love surely is before the wedding my first husband and i made a pact that we would see italy together the image of the two of us sipping chianti high in the abruzzi sustained us through those early years when we had to content ourselves with a weekend backpacking expedition or a night out in little italy how happy we would be in florence regarding the david what bliss we would discover in a midnight gondola alas by the time we booked the tickets we were drifting apart we could scarcely agree on a brand of toothpaste much less an itinerary still we arrived at what we thought was a healing arrangement since he had a trust fund he would pay for the trip since i spoke italian i would be guide and interpreter this symbiosis along with the mediterranean sun and ripe olives would reheat our passion but we realized with a growing sense of guilt that the flame had died florence irritated us as if the city 's buoyant nature were to blame for our ennui as we browsed the uffizi our eyes wandered all the beds seemed too narrow the breakfasts too cold he tried hard not to complain about cost i tried harder not to complain about linguistic incompetence in the end we took separate flights home at the edges of these depressing scenes luckily glimmers another sort of romance when i look back on my college escapade i can hardly see the face of the young man toward whom i thought i was traveling what comes to mind instead are the shoulder high banks of snow on the alpine paths the chandeliers at the hotel sacher the heart stopping funicular ride up to garmisch partenkirchen the night before the object of my affection first found me in the village where i was waitressing my boss gave us the night off and the whole staff of the hotel slid downhill to the village polka dance where the postmaster bought me a dark beer and i was spun around the room in a giddy whirl of oompahs and lederhosen likewise my swan song trip to italy afforded me the pleasure of picnicking among sunlit ruins with the peculiar scents of goat cheese and warm stone as a means to get or keep love these journeys were dismal as forays through the world and back to the self they fulfilled their promise after all many travelers women particularly strike up liaisons simply for the companionship of the road who can say that romance even when it fires the blood is not simply a catalyst for seeing the world more intensely for oneself even adele hugo had she regained her presence of mind might have looked past her caddish officer to the sublime highlands of cape breton the swirling colors of barbados which brings me to my final category though trying to wring love out of travel seems a doomed effort traveling when in love can prove nourishing after all you hardly care where you go so long as you go there together time loses meaning a missed train is an opportunity on my second honeymoon we had trouble getting out of the house a friend had lent us in versailles when we finally decamped for mont st michel we both felt the need to shake love 's laziness and get some fresh french air so we rented a pair of squat bicycles the next day we set off along the scenic coast and in what seemed the blink of an eye we reached historic avranches where we ate tartines and cooled off in the town 's sparkling swimming pool then we turned south how we had not noticed that the trip was more than 12 miles each way that it was mostly hilly that the winds blew hard from the west that our bicycle seats were each six inches too low for good pedaling that i had developed a blister or that a storm front was moving in only cupid can say for a time we took refuge in an allied graveyard then soaked and shivering our thighs cramping we hobbled and creaked the final kilometers until my husband 's front tire blew and we walked that night there was plenty of tlc and no room for blame i never want to see avranches again but every time we recall that disastrous bicycle ride one or the other of us gets a hug they coexist uneasily the urge to explore and the urge to entwine but i am not ready altogether to set them apart essay lucy ferriss 's most recent novel is nerves of the heart university

 as democratic chief of staff on the senate finance committee lawrence o'donnell jr spent a lot of time sitting through important congressional meetings but his agenda was a bit different from everyone else 's i would take two different kinds of notes mr o'donnell said one set related to the policy we were working on in the room and the other was about the atmospherics that were going on i always knew i 'd be leaving government someday i just did n't know when there was something about knowing that it was temporary that left me in writerly observational mode the first set of notes came in handy while mr o'donnell held the finance post from 1993 to 1995 the second set though continues to pay dividends as mr o'donnell channels the information into mister sterling which had its premiere this month the new nbc series centers on the trials and tribulations of an idealistic young lawyer josh brolin who also happens to be the son of william sterling a popular ex governor of california played by james whitmore when one of the state 's senators dies suddenly the younger mr sterling is unexpectedly given the temporary appointment to take his place the series may be a modern more issue oriented version of mr smith goes to washington but mr o'donnell who first began writing the show in 1992 and is one of its executive producers says it 's not strictly about politics this is a show in which the lead character 's first statement about politics is 'i hate politics he said right there we 're welcoming in viewers who do n't like politics this show is n't c span it 's about human drama and conflict we wo n't stay locked in congressional offices nbc executives also maintain that even though this is the network 's second show involving politicians mister sterling has very little in common with the west wing the emmy award winning series on which mr o'donnell previously worked as a writer and producer we felt like our schedule can support two shows like this said karey burke executive vice president for development of prime time series at nbc after all you can have different kinds of cop shows and different kinds of doctor shows why not different kinds of politician shows and mister sterling certainly tries to make its title character different rather than be a dyed in the wool democrat a la president bartlet on west wing mr sterling is a devout independent he supports oil drilling in alaska but also wants money to hire teachers for inmates he hops from one side of the fence to another depending on the issue something that mr o'donnell and the network hope will more accurately reflect how most americans and their elected officials really think the truth is even people who work within the parties are much more independent in private thinking than their public postures indicate mr o'donnell said they all have a list of things they dislike about what their parties are doing and that includes mr brolin the son of the actor james brolin and stepson of the decidedly democratic barbra streisand mr brolin was initially reluctant to take the role of mr sterling because he feared the show would be too partisan after meeting with mr o'donnell though he quickly changed his mind i was the kid with the mohawk growing up i was n't alec baldwin he said i do n't care about politics i vote and get involved when i need to i do it personally i would n't hire me to play a senator because i 'm not typical but lawrence wanted somebody who goes against the grain the notion of a truly independent united states senator let alone one with mr brolin 's movie star good looks is certainly not indicative of what americans have come to expect from their congressional representatives i do n't know if 'the west wing is really like the way politics is in this country but this show is fiction and can be idealistic mr brolin said but he added what you see on the show is not not possible it 's that fantasy element that really hooked the network it 's the same thing we saw with 'er ms burke said those were the doctors you wished could treat you with 'mister sterling these characters are the people we wish had these jobs in washington in real life but mr o'donnell though admitting to moments in every episode when he 'd think gee i 'd like to see things done this way in real life considers the series a pretty realistic depiction of the limits of power i 'm not trying to teach any lessons he said that might happen and i 'd be open to the possibility that people will say 'oh he 's trying to say this about that policy but that 's not what 's consciously driving my writing mr o'donnell does not think of mister sterling as particularly democratic or liberal he prefers to use another term activist i think this would be a little problematic dramatically if you tried to make a show about a conservative and the republicans would probably agree he said they want to do less in government and that 's a trickier thing to go at in drama how does a scene work when your character is the guy who does n't want to do something it 's a trickier thing trying to find the drama in that so for a tv show being activist is a good thing political correctness does n't hurt either the part of mr sterling 's chief of staff was n't written for an african american woman and at first that 's what kept audra mcdonald from auditioning for it i was protecting myself from disappointment said ms mcdonald who is best known for her award winning broadway performances i thought it was a great script but figured they 'd never cast me because i 'm black but everyone there really pushed for me because the thinking is very open minded for a tv show while mr o'donnell and the network do n't want to push politics too hard ms mcdonald said she was confident that audiences would be getting a civics lesson i hope we have an effect on people she said i 'd like this show to advance really good ideas and make people more aware of their own voice that 's certainly not out of the realm of possibility according to ms burke after 'er went on the air i heard that medical school enrollment started going up she said cover story craig tomashoff is a television critic

 the funny thing about the university of okoboji winter games has always been that there is no university this year there was no winter but the games must go on in sleet in snow and yes even in sunshine so instead of parking cars on smith 's bay where the ice this weekend was about 8 inches thick instead of the typical 40 organizers used a dirt lot on the shores of west lake okoboji a firebird was spotted with its top down the wild women of okoboji relay race replaced its obstacle course of snow angels and hockey pucks with a sand course culminating in each contestant 's hopping with an uncooked hot dog in her mouth the dog sled races were scrapped because it was too warm for the huskies participants in the freeze your fanny bike ride were seen sweating the polar bear jump into a hole in the frozen lake was never more popular four years ago with the wind chill factor it was 54 degrees below zero saturday it was 64 degrees above breaking records not just for the day previously 45 degrees in 1973 but the entire month of january 63 degrees 1981 normally it 's just miserable and the idiot people still come out said bob shaw 56 who helped start the winter games 22 years ago with a broom ball tournament to lure people out of hibernation i think a lot of it is just the magic of okoboji some people might call it stupidity okoboji which locals translate from an unspecified american indian tongue as beautiful lake or place of rest is the name of two lakes and a town in the so called iowa great lakes a resort area 100 miles east of sioux falls sd and 175 miles southwest of minneapolis the county 's population of 15000 swells to 150000 in summer the winter games is a chamber of commerce effort to bring the summer visitors and their wallets back it is a lemonade from lemons kind of enterprise the residents have a big frozen lake they have beer they make fun the centerpiece remains the broom ball men 's and powder puff divisions a hockey without skates sort of game played not with actual brooms they tend to break but with special wooden sticks that have a red plastic triangle on the bottom there is also slow pitch softball where the rules demand must slide on close plays given the ice fields sliding is also fairly common in football bowling and miniature golf with this year 's record breaking temperatures some of the drunker competitors also slid on their stomachs to celebrate victory or numb defeat 's agony we 're still waiting for espn said carole caviness who works for the chamber and has lived in the area 20 years before there were winter games there was the university of okoboji a figment of herman richter 's imagination that has over the decades raised millions of dollars for charity not to mention mr richter 's clothing store in neighboring milford and spread pennants and bumper stickers from the great wall of china to the south pole mr richter 57 who says he majored in a severely positive attitude at the university of okoboji and has his thumb perpetually up looked around his hometown in the early 1970 's and saw the makings of a great university beautiful campus fun people plenty of bars we 're missing one little piece classes he said well who cares the school motto where fun in life is your degree means that all who take part and enjoy themselves count as alumni joe theismann ronald mcdonald and former president george bush have received honorary degrees along with a golf cap and beach towel during visits to the campus plenty of tickets are available all on the 50 yard line front row to see the university 's undefeated fighting phantoms football team play the winner of iowa iowa state 1 pm nebraska 4 pm and notre dame 8 pm on sept 31 at the university of okoboji the highest honor is to be a cheerleader allowed to carry the torch a pole with a flaming roll of toilet paper to light the pile of hundreds of christmas trees at the winter games extravaganza saturday night this year the bonfire was on land rather than on the lake and it was hot the games which take 44000 and 600 volunteers to put on and draw some 3000 people most from northwest iowa but a few from omaha chicago and even denver began friday afternoon with a bridge party and will end with a dance monday night this year instead of three layers of long underwear weston sharp of indianola south of des moines had on shorts a t shirt and sunglasses saturday between his wool hat and boots for a game of softball i 'd go water skiing right now if someone could put a boat out mr sharp said between the softball fields and the beer tent sat the elgersma clan a group of about a dozen families from primghar iowa about 45 miles from here who camp on the lake in summer and started coming back for the winter games five years ago the ice fishing shack that gives the children a place to warm up was largely empty as everyone sat on the 1970 's era upholstered couch and easy chairs arrayed on the ice in years past by the time the hot dogs were done roasting on the outdoor fire the buns would be frozen this year the only concern was whether the beer was cold enough it 's not as fun we do n't get to ride snowmobiles or anything complained sara bootsma 10 who wore short sleeves as she stood outside it 's better when it 's cold
 sometimes success in television turns to failure faster than a teenager can change channels this is an especially painful truth at vh1 these days once a cultural force for baby boomers vh1 is not just a fading music channel with a ratings slide it has become a major worry for viacom its parent company that is why viacom has brought in the mtv programming president brian graden a cable wunderkind known to have an uncanny eye for hit programs it hopes he will be able to pull off the delicate balancing act of trying to reach what it considers the ideal broad vh1 audience those in their mid 20 's who have graduated beyond the pierced bubble gum pop of mtv through those who remember swimming in the mud of woodstock the first time industry executives will be watching closely mr graden 's touch in the late 1990 's brought new hits to basic cable that broke the old rules with raw anything goes humor and ultimately pushed the barriers of taste for all television when the pop culture history of the last decade is written it will certainly not leave out graden backed projects like south park on comedy central and jackass and the osbournes at mtv a lot is riding on the continued success of mr graden 's golden instincts for viacom in the last two years vh1 an important revenue generator has failed to develop any new hits instead relying on old shows like behind the music the biography program about rock stars from days gone by 80 's sensations milli vanilli motley crue def leppard in the meantime its average audience decreased more than 20 percent in the past year to 200000 people last quarter with even worse dips in key demographic categories some weeks that has cost viacom tens of millions of dollars in rebates to advertisers who did not reach as large an audience as vh1 had promised and were compensated with free spots with so much advertising time filled with those give backs vh1 ran out of room to accommodate everyone viacom was forced to find time on its healthier networks like mtv and tnn officials said mel karmazin the president of viacom was not pleased suddenly one of viacom 's proudest assets had become a serious liability even as its younger skewing music channel sibling mtv climbed to historic highs there is wide consensus in the television industry that mr graden with help from vh1 's new general manager christina norman is the right person to right the ship his responsibilities were extended to vh1 last week by judy mcgrath the mtv networks music group president who took charge of vh1 when john sykes the former vh1 president was put in charge of infinity radio in march mr graden effectively replaces fred graver head vh1 programmer for a year there is considerable fear within mtv networks that mr graden a harvard mba may be spread too thin and that the division of his attention could hurt both vh1 and mtv but that seems to be counterbalanced by general impatience for a recovery at vh1 it 's a drag on everybody said one viacom executive ms mcgrath said mtv was humming along so well that mr graden would have ample time to focus on his new charge people inside and outside viacom often take jabs at vh1 referring to the cobwebs hanging on the behind the music and before they were rock stars franchises and blame an over reliance on those shows for vh1 's problems they just basically ran their hits into the ground said larry gerbrandt chief content officer of kagan world media a media research firm but current and former viacom executives said that after so many years building a rock solid brand identity for vh1 its leadership erred recently in trying to make the network so long considered a haven for baby boomers more narrowly focused on the hipper younger members of generation x those in their late 20 's to mid 30 's taking aim at generation x had its own difficulties some at vh1 felt it was dangerous to put so much emphasis on a younger demographic that considered it a network for older people while risking the alienation of its more mature core many at viacom felt the team spent too much time wringing hands about the target audience and not enough time making television supporters of mr graver said he was not given enough time to make things work none of the four new programs introduced in march including a nighttime talk show late world with zach and a music trivia show called never mind the buzzcocks generated much attention or ratings mr graden now has his work cut out for him to reach what is jokingly referred to as the new vh1 target people with eyeballs he has been here before he found mtv in a similar position when he arrived there in 1997 with mtv riding on the strength of programs like real world but little else it was bleeding ratings and revenues they were in a little bit of a calamity he said in a telephone interview people would say 'if we were just cooler more people would watch there was too much concern about marketing and not enough about programming he added mr graden said he quickly began to apply his formula it does not include any grand vision he says he casts aside focus group research and follows his instincts assigning a team to produce inexpensive experimental pilots freely and keeping an open mind to their ideas like following the family of an aging rock star the osbournes or showing someone stun himself with a taser gun jackass i believe in constantly being open and never thinking you know too much he said sometimes the good ideas are the ones that borrow nothing from the world before them if somebody came in a year ago and pitched ozzy osbourne as the next big thing on paper nobody would have bought that before he started at mtv mr graden was already somewhat of a cable legend as a young executive at the news corporation 's foxlabs experimental programming studio in the mid 1990 's he discovered the hit young animators matt stone and trey parker to keep them in his fold he gave them 2000 to create a video christmas card for him featuring the characters of what is now south park that made the rounds in hollywood eventually to become south park on comedy central of course what appeals to an mtv audience that includes teenage girls and fraternity boys will not necessarily appeal to the more grown up vh1 audience mr graden acknowledges that he is being asked to draw a broader audience than that of mtv but his biggest hits like the osbournes and south park have appealed to people of all ages he said he would seek programs he considered funny or insightful or touching and hope his tastes squared with those of the audience you ca n't be that precious about it he said my job is to find that universal emotional connection he said he believed his instincts would be on the mark at vh1 because just like many in the vh1 audience his tastes are maturing beyond mtv at some point i 'll grow out of it and i 'll just program vh1 he said and after that i 'll go program the aarp channel
 most music fans congregating in napster 's chat rooms yesterday afternoon were seeking an answer to a simple question as anongirl put it succinctly how long do we have besides setting off a stampede to download free music before it is too late yesterday 's decision by a three judge panel of the ninth circuit court of appeals in san francisco that napster should be prohibited from enabling the swapping of copyrighted music appeared to hand a significant victory to the recording industry in its crusade against internet piracy but the second most asked question among napster users yesterday may indicate that major record labels that sued napster for copyright infringement have a longer way to go to win in the court of public opinion jeffoboy15 's query does anyone know of any other programs for music transfer was echoed and answered by many others the answer is that there are several although none provide the wide range of music or the ease of use of napster much of the debate over napster has centered on whether consumers have a fair use right under copyright law to share music that they already own with whomever they saw fit whether it be one friend or napster 's 58 million users the court ruled yesterday that napster users were infringing copyrights in its decision the court said napster would be required to remove any copyrighted material that it was informed was being being traded through its service and officials at the recording industry association of america the trade group that sued napster on behalf of the major record companies talked of new technologies that would make it possible to identify the copyrighted songs stored on the computers of the individuals who make them available for other napster users to download and listen to but the extraordinary napster phenomenon has been fueled only in part by the technology that made it possible it is also based in the antipathy many users express toward the music industry and the sense that the cost of compact discs is far too high hey napster is stealing songs one participant in the alternative napster chat room wrote yesterday afternoon you must admit if there was no napster you would pay for cd 's another responded no i 'd just burn my friends cd 's the music industry is getting too much cash from kids to burn a cd is to transfer computer files onto a compact disc aware of the sentiments of the napster users some legal scholars who disagreed with parts of the ninth circuit 's decision said the ruling would ultimately work against the recording industry my view is that the riaa loses the battle and loses the war because they become the bad guys said lawrence lessig an expert on internet law at stanford university with every song they tell napster to remove the political resistance to this extreme view of copyright law will grow stronger napster with backing from the bertelsmann music group plans to make a subscription service available in the fall several legal experts said the court decision yesterday would probably encourage a settlement between napster and other major record labels which might enable napster to offer more music by subscription in the meantime however napster users may have to find other alternatives and judging from their online comments few seemed inclined to return to the record store the leading possible substitutes like gnutella and freenet are considerably harder to use but they are also harder to police because unlike napster they do not maintain a central index of users that share music files the developers of those programs said they did not see how the court ruling could be applied to them this is going to make life difficult for a lot of music swapping fans out there said gene kan a developer of gnutella but maybe the larger concern should be that there 's no above ground alternative for napster users in the sense that the music industry has not come forward with their own version of napster to allow people to swap files on line which is something they obviously want to do of the major record labels only bertelsmann has sought to build a fee based music sharing service by teaming with napster many napster users have said they are willing to pay a small fee to use the new service if it works as the current version does to provide access to much of the world 's music but few have expressed an abiding loyalty to napster as it goes mainstream and perhaps unfortunately for the music industry the ability to share digital music files in the mp3 format has acquired a certain subversive cachet that may be hard to shake if napster does shut down there are more sites out there obsidian tempest 24 a security guard and disc jockey in ontario wrote in an e mail message to a reporter and they may get a few but they ca n't stop all of them wes feltz 16 of pittsburgh wrote in an e mail message they 'll never stop mp3 's they 'll always exist i can upload mp3 's on my web site right now if i want to mr feltz for one is not worried about finding a napster alternative he said he had enough cd 's to listen to for now because over the six months that he has been using napster he has burned almost 70 separate discs

 'the decalogue krzysztof kieslowski 's 10 part masterwork was first shown on polish television in 1988 89 and finally released in theaters this year it is a sweeping meditation on the human condition

 in 1942 gordon hirabayashi was imprisoned for violating a military curfew that applied only to japanese americans a preliminary step in the government 's forcible relocation of all persons of japanese ancestry from the west coast to remote detention camps when that began fred korematsu another japanese american evaded detention for which he was also convicted in the mid 1980 's amid a national wave of regret for the wartime discrimination federal courts erased both men 's convictions congress has apologized to japanese americans and reparations have been paid the historical lesson of these two cases appears simple government crackdowns based solely upon race or ethnicity are wrong but while the korematsu and hirabayashi decisions are often cited as infamous examples of the legal vulnerability of ethnic groups their broader lesson is the judiciary 's frailty in the face of pressing concerns about national security that frailty may well resurface as in the wake of the events of sept 11 america debates whether to significantly loosen rules for electronic surveillance and dramatically truncate judicial protections for resident aliens some passages from the supreme court 's two opinions read as if they could apply today the court unanimously affirmed mr hirabayashi 's conviction on the basis that residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of a different ancestry even the court 's more liberal members agreed justice william o douglas said that the wisdom or expediency of the decision which was made is not for us to review justice frank murphy merely registered reluctance few indeed have been the invasions upon essential liberties which have not been accompanied by pleas of urgent necessity advanced in good faith by reasonable men he warned the supreme court likewise affirmed the conviction of mr korematsu but in his case the justices fractured six to three justice hugo black celebrated as a liberal by many scholars declared on behalf of the majority that when under conditions of modern warfare our shores are threatened by hostile forces the power to protect must be commensurate with the threatened danger agreeing with justice black justice felix frankfurter emphasized that action is not to be stigmatized as lawless because like action in times of peace would be lawless however one of the three dissenters justice robert h jackson perhaps the best prose stylist ever to sit on the high court argued persuasively that the harm done by the majority would reach far beyond race a military order however unconstitutional is not apt to last longer than the military emergency he wrote but once a judicial opinion rationalizes such an order to show that it conforms to the constitution or rather rationalizes the constitution to show that the constitution sanctions such an order the court for all time has validated that rationalizing principle and that principle then lies about like a loaded weapon ready for the hand of any authority than can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need and hirabayashi and korematsu both demonstrated jackson warned that the federal judiciary is unlikely ever to constrain executive branch excess if the people ever let command of the war power fall into irresponsible and unscrupulous hands the courts wield no power equal to its restraint the chief restraint upon those who command the physical forces of the country in the future as in the past must be their responsibility to the political judgments of their contemporaries and to the moral judgments of history three decades later jackson 's argument was validated by the posthumous confession of the man who as governor of california had been in the words of one sympathetic biographer the most visible and effective force behind the internment the legendary chief justice earl warren celebrated like douglas and black as a liberal chief justice warren professed himself conscience stricken over the role he had played in the 1940 's it was wrong to react so impulsively without positive evidence of disloyalty even though we felt we had a good motive in the security of our state he wrote in his memoirs it demonstrates the cruelty of war when fear get tough military psychology propaganda and racial antagonism combine with one 's responsibility for public security to produce such acts but the decisions are far from universally regretted earl warren 's guilt was not shared by hugo black who even in the late 1960 's embraced his opinion in the korematsu case declaring i would do precisely the same thing today and even in the year 2001 as prominent a judicial voice as richard a posner the circuit court judge confesses that i actually think korematsu was correctly decided chief justice william h rehnquist writing three years ago in his book all the laws but one civil liberties in wartime said that in time of war the government 's authority to restrict civil liberty is greater than in peacetime and that distinctions that might not be permissible between classes of citizens must be viewed otherwise when drawn between classes of aliens indeed chief justice rehnquist volunteered that for cases like korematsu there is no reason to think that future justices of the supreme court will decide questions differently from their predecessors however writing in 1984 in the reopened case that erased mr korematsu 's conviction district judge marilyn hall patel agreed with justice jackson and chief justice warren that the legal legacy of the japanese internment reached beyond racism and illuminated a greater danger it stands as a caution that in times of distress the shield of military necessity and national security must not be used to protect governmental actions from close scrutiny and accountability it stands as a caution that in times of international hostility and antagonisms our institutions legislative executive and judicial must be prepared to exercise their authority to protect all citizens from the petty fears and prejudices that are so easily aroused the rule of fear david j garrow is

 prominent national democrats now regard senator robert g torricelli of new jersey as their party 's most vulnerable senate incumbent prompting concern that his endangered seat might cost democrats control of the senate many democrats said they had expected mr torricelli to overcome his ethics troubles more easily instead his predicament has roiled the party and stirred resentment toward him among fellow democrats some of them say that mr torricelli 's wounds are self inflicted and that he opened himself to attack not to mention gave ammunition to his republican challenger douglas r forrester by engaging in behavior that led the senate ethics committee to reprimand him in july for improperly accepting gifts from a campaign donor echoing a sentiment that is widespread among party leaders in and out of congress terry mcauliffe the chairman of the democratic national committee said he now viewed mr torricelli as the most endangered democratic incumbent in the senate torricelli 's is the tightest mr mcauliffe said in an interview this week referring to mr torricelli 's race he 's dead even at best some democrats also say they are concerned that the party 's focus on new jersey threatens to limit the money and other resources that are available for other democrats in september alone the democratic senatorial campaign committee spent 21 million on three television advertisements promoting mr torricelli 's positions on crucial voting issues in new jersey including abortion rights environmental protection and gun safety democratic party officials say they intend to pump well over 5 million into helping mr torricelli defend his seat but mr mcauliffe and other party leaders also say that the interest generated by the torricelli race has helped draw more money than they expected bob is bringing millions of dollars in mr mcauliffe said if anything bob is creating excitement out there and helping raise more money the situation is a remarkable reversal of fortune for mr torricelli who is completing his first term in the senate after serving in the house as chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign committee in 2000 he helped bring the number of democrats in the senate to 50 the party gained its one vote advantage last year when senator james m jeffords of vermont left the republican party to become an independent but now some of the same senators mr torricelli helped are concerned that his troubles may send democrats back into the minority it 's come as a surprise to many of us that this race is as close as it is said senator charles e schumer democrat of new york this is now one of the two or three most important races for us as democrats because control of the senate could hinge on its outcome james carville the democratic consultant said the ethics committee report turned a noncompetitive race into a competitive race mr torricelli 's campaign manager ken snyder acknowledged that the senator faced a difficult challenge in june mr torricelli led mr forrester by 14 points now several independent political publications including the cook political report and the rothenberg report are rating the race as a tossup or leaning toward mr forrester the president of a company that manages pharmacy benefits but mr snyder said mr torricelli would prevail because of his rival 's opposition to abortion rights and gun control which he said would not go over well with new jersey voters mr snyder also criticized mr forrester 's stand on the environment in deference to mr torricelli many senators declined to criticize their colleague publicly a top senate democrat said the level of concern among mr torricelli 's colleagues was so deep that senate leaders had pulled mr torricelli aside to ask how he could have inflicted such damage on his own political prospects but mr torricelli did not provide a full explanation apart from acknowledging errors in judgment this democrat recalled mr torricelli 's supporters acknowledge that he brought his problems on himself but they add it is important for democrats not to lose sight of what is at stake in the november election continued democratic control of the senate senator joseph i lieberman democrat of connecticut agreed that the turn in mr torricelli 's position was surprising there are a significant number of races that are very competitive and could go either way mr lieberman said and so what you have to say now is that the new jersey race is one more race that becomes from what we read in the polls competitive but it 's one of many i mean this election is going to be extremely close the senate could go either way one person close to mr torricelli sought to wring some good out of the senator 's troubles saying that at least now the national party had his race on the election map it 's entirely possible that new jersey would have been overlooked and the resources would have come too late this person said fortunately the party became mobilized before labor day and will make the necessary effort to help torricelli win mr torricelli 's troubles involve an accusation that he improperly accepted thousands of dollars in unreported gifts and cash from a political supporter david chang mr torricelli did not deny taking gifts from mr chang but said he took no illegal gifts the justice department referred the case to the senate ethics committee after prosecutors closed their inquiry without indicting mr torricelli in july the ethics committee severely admonished him asserting that he had violated senate rules some democrats say the action taken by the ethics committee was so mild that they did not expect it to hurt mr torricelli 's re election campaign but republicans have seized on it and mr forrester has even called on mr torricelli to resign the senate ethics committee thought what they did was appropriate but no big deal said one prominent senate democrat and then to see it blow up like this there are so many other things that would have been more severe if the evidence had warranted it a letter of reprimand is really on the scale of what an ethics committee can do relatively minor

 new york city is receiving less federal money to help people get jobs and could lose more because of an ongoing failure to spend what has been allocated city council officials said yesterday at a hearing to review the city 's employment programs council members expressed concern that the city was not moving quickly enough to spend the federal funds under the federal workforce investment act created in 1998 the city has received hundreds of millions of dollars to create one stop career centers where job referrals counseling training and other services are provided but government officials and workers advocates have long expressed concern that the giuliani administration had channeled most of the funds to the city 's welfare agency to get people off welfare and had not offered enough support to people seeking work state and federal officials had warned city officials last year that about 70 million could revert to the federal coffers if not spent within two years yesterday the city 's employment commissioner betty b wu told the council 's general welfare committee that those millions in jeopardy which have been available to the city since the middle of 2001 would be spent by the middle of next year already ms wu said the city has opened two new one stop centers called workforce 1 career centers one in the bronx the other in harlem bringing the total to three but council officials complained that there was still more than 96 million allocated for the 2002 program year that has not been touched ms wu told the committee that her agency which took over the work force program earlier this year would begin spending the 2002 funds once the 2001 money had been exhausted

 the government ratified an important united nations human rights treaty today even as its own rights record has continued to come under increasing international criticism and scrutiny the standing committee of the national people 's congress approved the international convention on economic social and cultural rights a day after the united nations high commissioner for human rights mary robinson visited china but the government 's brief official announcement suggested that it might hedge on a full commitment to the part of the treaty that is the biggest problem for china article 8 which proclaims the right to form and join free labor unions according to the new china news agency the lawmaking body agreed to assume the obligations prescribed in item 1 a of article 8 in line with provisions of china 's constitution trade union law and labor law the law recognizes just one union which is state sanctioned and prohibits the formation of independent groups the constitution does not recognize the right to strike china has jailed dozens of people for independent labor activity on the one hand this is a big step forward mike jendrzejczyk of human rights watch in washington said but it makes it even more urgent now that china bring its labor laws into compliance with international labor laws and practices the chinese clearly hope that the ratification will sway two votes on march 19 a united nations human rights meeting in geneva will vote on whether to censure china for its continuing problems perhaps more important to china 's leaders in july the international olympic committee will decide whether to give beijing the 2008 summer games a spokesman for the high commissioner 's office in geneva jose diaz said it had not received the official documents from china and could not yet comment mr diaz said a clarification of the chinese position could take time although it is in their interest to do it quickly on tuesday ms robinson said a serious reservation on article 8 would be extremely disappointing the convention allows member countries to enter reservations on treaty clauses indicating that such parts will not be followed united nations officials said it was not clear whether china was planning to enter a reservation to the union clause or if it was merely signaling its intent to interpret the clause still ms robinson said the ratification would be enormously important legally and psychologically for china providing a real tool and a framework for progress in rights because it mandates periodic united nations evaluations of china 's record including its labor practices the convention 's goals include safe work places free compulsory primary education and equal pay for women members are subject to periodic united nations inspections even if china does not register a reservation the treaty gives countries fairly wide discretion in carrying out its terms the article states that no restrictions may be placed on the right to organize other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others this week china indicated it was not close to signing what is considered in the west to be a more important convention the accord the convention on civil and political rights enshrines rights like universal suffrage freedom of association and freedom to live where one chooses

 with security at its tightest levels in a year at government installations in the united states and abroad the first anniversary of the hijackings passed without serious incident today but senior administration officials continued to warn of the possibility of an attack on a day when federal authorities girded for the worst when emergency command posts at government agencies were heavily staffed by intelligence and law enforcement officials the day offered more tedium than tension we 're tearing around but it 's just really quiet out there said one senior law enforcement official teams of federal agents some with radiation detection gear scoured a liberian flagged cargo ship that was detained off the port newark elizabeth marine terminal the ship was stopped before it was to dock when traces of radioactivity were detected in its cargo and unexplained sounds possibly from stowaways were heard in the vessel 's cargo areas the ship m v palermo senator was ordered to a security zone six miles out to sea in columbus ohio police evacuated the 41 story james a rhodes state office tower after an employee encountered a man behaving suspiciously on the 28th floor when questioned by the employee the man said he was looking for someplace to hide a bomb said lt gary lewis a state police spokesman state police and federal bomb experts cleared the building and began searching a van belonging to the man 's employer bomb sniffing dogs reacted on several occasions to substances in the van but the authorities did not find a bomb the suspect oscar sesmas 35 was charged with inducing panic a felony it has been a somewhat busy day across the country said gordon johndroe spokesman for the white house office of homeland security there were daily reports of incidents across the country mr johndroe said but the volume had been slightly higher today while we have no incidents that immediately indicate terrorism there are some people who are being interviewed by authorities to track all information down necessary to conclude the investigations he said mr johndroe said the increased reporting might have been the result of nervousness on the part of citizens and greater numbers of law enforcement officers deployed to protect memorial gatherings air combat patrols which resumed over washington and new york last friday expanded today to include about 10 additional cities military officials said fighter jets were placed on alert at more than a dozen other locations increased police presence was visible in cities around the country missile launchers were positioned around washington and federal and city police were out in force around the monuments in los angeles city police were at full deployment throughout the day in part because of the federal action and in part to monitor the numerous commemorative events taking place citywide evidence of the bush administration 's edgy observance of the sept 11 hijackings was most noticeable abroad nine american embassies remained shut including diplomatic posts in southeast asia it was the possibility of al qaeda attacks in that region that prompted the bush administration on tuesday to ratchet up the threat alert level the level was raised to code orange the second highest risk level in the color coded threat warning system today the precautionary steps spread throughout the world pentagon officials said that commanders in charge of a region that sweeps from east africa to central asia increased its security level to the military 's highest threat level in europe three embassies and four consulates received envelopes in the mail containing an unidentified white powder government officials said none of the diplomatic posts were closed in each case officials removed the powder and envelopes to a secure location and tests were planned to determine whether the powder was anthrax or another lethal substance the official said the identities of the countries that received the envelopes were not disclosed but an embassy official in rome said that one of the mailings had been received there some time this morning late in the morning we got a batch of international mail not diplomatic not military from outside italy there was a letter addressed generically to the embassy which is unusual in itself when the mailroom people picked up the letter they could tell there was some kind of granular stuff inside other countries also reacted to the threat warnings british officials closed their embassies in jakarta and singapore as a precautionary measure an official said australia closed its embassy in east timor the former indonesian province that acquired its independence earlier this year and closed except for emergencies in singapore as western governments continued to investigate the intelligence that led to the concerns about a terrorist attack they are finding parallels to a plot to blow up the american british and australian embassies in singapore last year western officials said today that plot which was thwarted was the work of jemaah islamiyah a militant organization with deep roots in indonesia officials said they have shown a sophistication and level of capability to carry out an attack like this said a western diplomat in singapore speaking about the current threat they have to be taken very seriously australian officials said that jemaah islamiyah which is headed by an indonesian cleric abu bakar bashir was behind the threats that led to the decision to close their embassy in east timor the australian and british embassies in singapore flank the american embassy which remained open today following a brief outdoors memorial ceremony diplomats said the american embassy was better protected higher on a hill and a virtual fortress while the two other embassies were more vulnerable mr johndroe did not say when the threat condition would return to its previous alert level but many local and state officials said they intended to return to normal police staffing levels on thursday gov gary locke of washington said that he had already ordered more state police staffing for the sept 11 ceremonies before the federal government ratcheted up its threat assessment he said he planned to return duty rosters to normal on thursday or friday no one can guarantee there wo n't be an attack in their own community at some point mr locke said but if there is we 're much better prepared to prevent or respond to such an attack than we were before sept 11

 a federal judge has ordered that the simon property group be stripped of its control of the mall of america in minnesota saying that the company the nation 's largest retail real estate investment trust breached its fiduciary duty to its canadian partner by secretly arranging to gain an ownership interest in the mall in his ruling issued late wednesday judge paul a magnuson of united states district court in minneapolis ordered simon to sell a 275 percent stake in the mall to its partner triple five a company owned by four brothers raphael nader bahman and eskander ghermezian for 814 million that transaction would put triple five in charge of the mall a 42 million square foot shopping and entertainment complex that is the country 's largest the ghermezians who originated the idea for the mall and were awarded the right to develop the site in 1986 own an even bigger 53 million square foot mall in west edmonton alberta the judge who heard about nine weeks of testimony in the nonjury trial also ordered that triple five replace simon as managing general partner of the mall which is a mile and a half from minneapolis st paul international airport he also increased the ghermezians share of the management fees to 80 percent from 20 percent those fees are about 5 percent of the mall 's annual gross income or 5 million according to the ghermezians lawyer roger james magnuson who is not related to the judge the ruling calls for a special master to determine how much simon owes triple five including net profits resulting from its ownership interest in the mall since 1999 and those from the sale to ikea of a 15 acre site north of the mall in a statement issued yesterday from its indianapolis headquarters simon property said the company believes that the court 's order is legally and factually wrong the statement did not say whether the company would appeal les morris a company spokesman said only that the court order contained many inaccuracies but declined to elaborate simon now owns or has an interest in 239 properties in 36 states in conjunction with westfield america another shopping center developer simon has been engaged in a battle to take over a rival mall empire taubman centers for 174 billion simon 's shares closed at 4336 yesterday up 08 percent from 4315 mr magnuson a partner with dorsey whitney said his clients would add value to the mall but he said he did not expect the ghermezians to replace all of simon 's managers they do n't want to rattle any sabers or rock the boat he said nader ghermezian said in a statement that the company expected a smooth harmonious transition and a cooperative relationship with our partners the partners plan to expand the mall by developing a 43 acre site adjacent to the new ikea store which is under construction the partnership between triple five and simon then known as melvin simon and associates to develop the mall of america began in 1987 after the mall opened in 1992 teachers insurance annuity association the financial services company converted its 650 million construction loan into an equity loan and was given a 55 percent stake in the property with simon and triple five each owning 225 percent in june 1999 however teachers now known as tiaa cref sold half its interest to simon for about 318 million in their lawsuit buttressed by dozens of e mail messages letters and secretly recorded telephone conversations the ghermezians argued that not only did simon not tell them about the negotiations but that simon executives tried to intimidate them once they heard about the transaction during the trial simon contended that teachers did not want to deal with the ghermezians and said that triple five did not have the money to buy the 275 percent interest rejecting these arguments the judge said triple five had enough cash in 1999 to buy all of the interest sold to simon as late as december 1998 the judge said teachers thought that the ghermezians might be involved in the transaction triple five bears some responsibility for its strained relationship with its partner judge magnuson wrote but he said evidence in the trial showed that simon executives engaged in behavior that can best be characterized as boorish behavior one might expect to see on a playground but not in dealings between sophisticated business partners he added business people can not and must not ignore ethics fairness and sound judgment when ordering their affairs this case presents an example of a situation in which business expediency overshadowed the very high duties the law imposes on partners correction september 15 2003 monday an article in business day on friday about a judge 's order to transfer control of the mall of america from the simon property group to a canadian company triple five referred incorrectly to parties that were found to have breached their fiduciary duty to triple five they were melvin and herbert simon and si minn lp not simon property si minn is a subsidiary of melvin simon associates that is controlled by melvin and herbert simon who are also co chairmen of simon property the article also misstated the location of another large mall west edmonton owned by triple five it is in edmonton alberta there is no municipality of west edmonton
 the may ratings sweep and the official television season ends tonight but the results for both are pretty well settled nbc again won both the sweep and season in the sought after category of viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 though it slid about 4 percent from last season cbs and fox gained both in the sweep and season with abc and cbs fighting to the wire for the most total viewers for the season but abc saw its audience fall back sharply from last year 's millionaire  driven season fox added some strong new entries like boston public and temptation island and won among viewers 18 to 34 and teenagers fox could challenge nbc for the 18 to 49 title next year when fox has both the super bowl and the world series nbc will counter though with the winter olympics nbc seemed relieved to get out of a tough season still at the top and pointed to the seemingly unshakeable strength of shows like law and order which had its best season in its 11th year for cbs the season also provided an unusual bounty of shows worthy of a second season led by csi and the district most significant cbs dropped the median age of its audience from 524 to 509 abc struggled to match its enormous success of last season as who wants to be a millionaire became less a phenomenon and more of a solid hit but the network staged a comeback of sorts at midseason with three new comedies among the smaller networks wb had a resurgent season among 18 to 34 year old viewers where it was up almost 20 percent it added the much praised gilmore girls upn suffered with its wrestling franchise getting body slammed by survivor but at the end of the season it stole two wb entries buffy the vampire slayer and roswell bill carter
 three years after the city brought managed care to its jails and gave one hospital a set fee to care for the roughly 17000 inmates at the rikers island jail complex and the manhattan detention center the initiative has been quietly abandoned and the city appears set to return to the system it once derided as too costly and inefficient the city 's effort to contain costs and improve care at the jails which was built around a three year 342 million deal with st barnabas hospital in the bronx had been plagued by disputes over the city 's role in monitoring the care provided as well as a continuing criminal investigation into possible negligence by the hospital earlier this year st barnabas announced that it would not seek to renew its contract when it expires next february in april though the city began to solicit proposals for a new contract and the payment system it proposes is strikingly similar to the fee for service plan it had sought to overhaul under the old system the city reimbursed the medical provider for each inmate 's care and also paid for each inmate 's hospital visits without limit a system that it said led to excessive hospital visits related security risks and rising costs inmates made almost 10700 hospital visits a year when montefiore medical center held the contract often for minor ailments that could have been treated at the jails city officials said four medical providers including st vincent 's hospital in manhattan are presenting bids this week for a new contract which is likely to be the largest jail care contract in the country two other providers are bidding for a smaller part of the contract ernesto marrero the executive director of correctional health services the city unit that oversees jail care and developed the new contract said that the new contract would incorporate the best of both models st barnabas 's on site treatment centers and the designated triage doctors who send only the sickest inmates to the hospital will remain he said but because the city will reimburse its new provider only for care that it gives it will be better able to monitor how money is spent mr marrero added that a plan in which payments were capped or capitated served a purpose by giving st barnabas an incentive to improve care in the jails by expanding preventive care and creating specialty clinics on site with that goal met he said it was time to moderate the approach mr marrero acknowledged that since the current contract allowed st barnabas to submit projected and not actual spending and staffing levels it was hard for the city to know exactly how much profit the hospital was making or how much care it was providing i like as much control as possible he said and a capitated plan does n't give me as much control as i would like but conflicts over the contract with st barnabas continue on tuesday st barnabas filed a lawsuit against the health and hospitals corporation the parent of correctional health services asserting its right to remove key pieces of medical equipment from the rikers island jail complex along with intellectual property like software systems the managed care contract did not specifically compensate st barnabas for these items which it now owns as a result the lawsuit states mr marrero said that in any multimillion dollar contract litigation was always brewing inmate advocates are delighted with the new plan and say they hope it will restore the humanity in jail care and the ideal of rikers as a laboratory in which to treat medical and social ills that whole ethic has been ripped to shreds and stomped on the floor by st barnabas said john boston director of the prisoners rights project for the legal aid society the central concept of giving the provider a bag of money and saying 'you can keep what you do n't spend has certainly been abandoned when the managed care contract began in january 1998 with st barnabas as the provider city officials hailed the new venture as a remedy for the problem of open ended costs luis r marcos director of the health and hospitals corporation said it would provide an incentive not to send patients to the hospital unnecessarily but within six months two inmates had died after delayed hospitalization and the manhattan district attorney opened an investigation into criminal negligence in the deaths emergency room doctors said that many inmates sent to the city hospitals showed serious signs of neglect an internal report done by the city showed that in its first year st barnabas was on a path to make 14 million in profit in part by spending far less on each inmate than it proposed to the city it would as the city tried to defend st barnabas 's performance several officials at correctional health services quit their jobs saying that medical neglect was going unchecked however st barnabas which has formed a for profit entity that is seeking national jail care contracts and recently began a promotional web site has defended its performance saying that it reversed a jail care system in decline the critics notwithstanding st barnabas hospital has done an exceptional job at rikers island as evidenced by new services reduced inmate mortality and the fact that its employees and systems are being sought for the next vendor said gerald mckelvey a hospital spokesman he added that the city 's oversight was archaic and obsolete from its inception and called the quality of health care that st barnabas inherited deplorable with the contract in its final months the city and st barnabas agree on almost nothing for example correctional health services recently found that in the last quarter of 1999 st barnabas failed to meet 12 of 30 performance benchmarks outlined in the contract including providing required levels of asthma care and hiv testing the agency fined st barnabas 60000 but the hospital is refusing to pay asserting that the city has refused to divulge how it came up with those findings next month the city will select its new jail care provider and has emphasized in its request for proposals that complete cooperation with its monitoring efforts is essential

 the united states attorney 's office is investigating allegations that a former aide to gov james e mcgreevey improperly solicited campaign donations by pressuring business owners who needed inspections and zoning variances from woodbridge township where mr mcgreevey was then mayor federal authorities said today rajesh roger chugh 49 helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for mr mcgreevey 's campaigns for governor in 1997 and 2001 according to state records and party officials and held a job in the administration from early 2002 until this june but earlier this year fbi agents began examining allegations that mr chugh pronounced choog an immigrant from the punjab region of india solicited contributions by threatening to block building permits for business owners in the little india section of woodbridge the complaints against mr chugh were first reported in the record of hackensack which quoted two business owners who said mr chugh demanded campaign contributions in exchange for his help with their dealings in woodbridge the paper also quoted several democratic party officials who said they warned mr mcgreevey about mr chugh 's aggressive behavior during the campaigns and were troubled when he was hired as a 10000 per month consultant to the state party during the campaign and given an 85000 job as an assistant in the secretary of state 's office cathy ellis the governor 's spokeswoman said today that mr mcgreevey 's campaign was careful to scrutinize all contributions solicited by mr chugh she added that the state party briefly suspended mr chugh during the 2001 campaign to review the donations he had solicited but ms ellis said that none of the contributors to the campaign ever filed a formal complaint about mr chugh 's activities with any government or law enforcement agency if jim mcgreevey had known of any illegal or unethical activity he would have taken action ms ellis said he would n't have tolerated it mr chugh has always been viewed as one of the more puzzling appointments mr mcgreevey has made several months after accepting a job in the secretary of state 's office he became the focus of unflattering news coverage because he ran a web site that overstated his resume and included personal details more often seen in dating service ads like references to his physical appearance and fondness for candlelight dinners the governor surprised many of his supporters by allowing mr chugh to retain his job and mr chugh continued to raise eyebrows with his eccentric behavior he occasionally stunned people in trenton by dropping to his knees and touching their feet a traditional indian greeting but republicans today seized on the news of the campaign finance allegations and the federal inquiry saying that mr chugh had become the latest in a succession of appointments to raise questions about the ethical standards of the mcgreevey administration this is a question of whether or not a member of the mcgreevey campaign and later his administration used tactics of extortion to raise money for governor mcgreevey 's campaign and whether or not the governor had any knowledge of these practices said state senator joseph m kyrillos jr republican state chairman michael drewniak spokesman for united states attorney christopher j christie declined to discuss the matter mr chugh did not return calls requesting comment but officials in the mcgreevey administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that mr chugh resigned in june after news reporters asked the governor 's office about court records indicating that a travel business he ran in the mid 1990 's had written tens of thousands of dollars in bad checks and was the subject of hundreds of thousands of dollars in liens and court judgments many officials in the new jersey indian community said they had warned mr mcgreevey that mr chugh had been bragging about his ability to handle political problems for campaign contributors pradip peter kothari who owns a travel agency in iselin said he and five other business leaders confronted mr mcgreevey about mr chugh 's fund raising abuses in march 2001 in a meeting that lasted four hours

 tobacco companies hoping that smoking scenes in hollywood movies would increase sales worked diligently through the 1980 's and early 90 's to get as much screen time for their brands as possible a british medical report says and at least one company went so far as to provide free cigarettes to actors and directors who might therefore be more inclined to light up when the cameras rolled the report released today by tobacco control a british medical quarterly that focuses on antismoking issues is based on more than 1500 formerly secret tobacco industry documents that became available as a result of the master settlement agreement between tobacco companies and states attorneys general in 1998 in many ways it confirmed what we suspected all along said curtis mekemson a consultant for the american lung association and the study 's prime author the tobacco companies were well aware of the benefits of having audiences especially young audiences see their favorite stars smoking on screen the most surprising revelation in the report mr mekemson said was that at least one tobacco company r j reynolds worked through a hollywood publicist to provide free tobacco in the early 80 's to actors and directors including jerry lewis john cassavetes liv ullmann and shelley winters that was really one of the most insidious revelations said kori titus director of antismoking programs for the american lung association of sacramento emigrant trails which sponsored the research they wanted to make sure hollywood stayed hooked on tobacco because actors who smoke are more likely to smoke in public or want to smoke on screen the documents listed 188 actors directors and other celebrities but it was unclear whether others might also have received free cigarettes or when the program ended nothing in the report however contradicts previous assertions by tobacco companies that they halted paid product placement more than a decade ago the industry papers studied end in the mid 1990 's and researchers were unable to find any evidence that tobacco companies continued providing free cigarettes or paying to place their product in films or television shows but this has had little impact on the frequency of smoking scenes the researchers say tobacco use in movies which was falling through the 1970 's and 1980 's increased significantly after 1990 the report concluded while there may be various reasons for this trend the extensive groundwork laid by the tobacco industry in the 1980 's and early 1990 's certainly played a role jack valenti president of the motion picture association of america which represents the major hollywood studios said he could not comment on a report he has not yet studied but he said nothing he had heard about it led him to believe there was any evidence of continuing efforts by tobacco companies to pay to place their brands on screen and he scoffed at the idea that hollywood stars could be bought for the price of a carton of cigarettes all of this is about what was happening 20 years ago mr valenti said what 's happening now if you 're a movie star why do you need anybody to give you a pack of cigarettes the issue mr valenti said is one of artistic freedom and creative choices i am opposed to smoking in movies he added it 's not good for your health but i am not an ideologue on this i am also a believer in freedom if somebody wants to smoke that 's their business the issue of paid tobacco product placement in which companies paid hollywood studios to include positive scenes of brand name tobacco use first became a flash point in the late 80 's culminating in 1989 congressional hearings the following year the tobacco companies amended their cigarette advertising and promotion code and promised to stop such product placement that voluntary move gained legal weight in 1998 when it became part of the companies settlement with the attorneys general in the intervening years although antismoking activists have found dozens of instances of movies using brand name cigarettes in scenes the studios and tobacco companies have maintained that there has been no further paid product placement mr mekemson acknowledged that there was nothing in the documents studied nor has anything emerged in the years since the documents ended to disprove that claim he said the companies were still allowed to provide free cigarettes and posters and billboard images to film productions and to sponsor film industry events like festivals golf tournaments and company picnics ms titus said that her group 's current effort was to convince hollywood to include warnings about tobacco use in its film ratings a move that mr valenti vehemently opposes the minute the ratings system starts with smoking then it 's going to be a movie where some chicken head is knocked off and it will become about cruelty to animals mr valenti said everybody will want a piece of the action
 teachers and other school employees went on strike yesterday in manville nj and hours later a state judge declared the walkout illegal and ordered them back to work kathy kovach the president of the school employees union said its lawyers would appear before the judge roger mahon this morning and ask him to order the local school board to resume contract negotiations immediately she said in a statement that the teachers and others would not work under a contract that the board imposed on the union tuesday the walkout by 152 teachers nurses custodians and secretaries led to a bumpy day in the four schools in manville a middle class town of 11000 in somerset county school officials managed to hire only 32 substitute teachers and the four schools were closed for the day at 12 30 pm said manville 's superintendent francis heelan seventy percent of the district 's 1300 pupils went to school and some high school students walked out of classes before schools were shut at midday dr heelan said ms kovach a high school art teacher said the main issues were the imposed contract and a dispute over wages last month ms kovach said the school board set a deadline of april 17 for a voluntary settlement and then last week rejected the union 's request for around the clock bargaining over the easter weekend they refused to negotiate she said dr heelan said the board set the deadline to try to make the budget final for the next school year the walkout over an imposed contract is the 15th in new jersey since 1980 said ed richardson a spokesman for the new jersey education association the statewide teachers union in the past he said state judges have ruled that new jersey labor law allows school boards and other government agencies to impose contracts on public employees after a state mediator has been unable to resolve an impasse in collective bargaining ms kovach said the union considered the law unfair because it forced on teachers and other public employees working conditions they had rejected during negotiations the new contract was based on a state fact finder 's nonbinding recommendations issued early last month the school board had already accepted them while the union rejected them the fact finder suggested a wage increase of 38 percent in the first year of a new four year contract and 41 percent in each of the next three years ms kovach said the pay scale for manville 's teachers is 31000 to 66000 ms kovach said the union wanted annual increases similar to the 42 to 45 percent won by teachers in other towns in somerset in the last year
 former senator bill bradley got a big lift from an old friend today announcing that the former chicago bulls superstar michael jordan would appear in a 30 second television commercial for the bradley campaign that will begin running in several important primary states on friday though mr jordan and his wife each contributed 1000 to mr bradley last year mr jordan has never publicly endorsed a political candidate until now aides to mr bradley said bradley aides say the endorsement will significantly help mr bradley 's name recognition among blacks and younger voters two important target groups for his campaign mr bradley had a hall of fame career of his own with the new york knicks from 1967 until 1977 and has received many endorsements from basketball greats of his era but he is not well known among younger sports fans bradley aides stressed today that mr jordan was a revered figure for more than his basketball prowess he brought an integrity to his play that speaks to deeper values said eric hauser mr bradley 's spokesman the ad will feature mr jordan speaking directly into a camera and praising mr bradley 's positions on issues including health care and gun control it will run in at least four states that hold primaries on march 7 california new york ohio and missouri mr jordan 's endorsement was not entirely a surprise because he has been friendly with mr bradley for years both are also very close to phil jackson the former bulls coach who played with mr bradley on the knicks but there had been some doubts about whether mr jordan would be willing to endanger his lucrative promotion contracts by publicly helping a presidential candidate in a move that may have made it easier for him to endorse mr bradley mr jordan recently was made president of the washington wizards basketball team whose owner abe pollin is a major fund raiser for mr bradley but aides to mr bradley said mr jordan filmed the commercial two months ago before he joined the wizards

 john walker lindh the 20 year old american who fought with the taliban has provided useful information to united states officials who have detained him at a desert marine base in southern afghanistan american officials said today vice president dick cheney appearing on the nbc news program meet the press said he understood that mr walker who uses his mother 's surname had provided some useful information and that once the united states was through debriefing him he will be turned over to the civilian authorities most likely the justice department mr cheney said that while he had trouble understanding how mr walker ended up fighting with the taliban he would reserve judgment on his fate pending further investigation military intelligence agents have completed their interrogation of mr walker and his fate now rests in the hands of officials in washington senior pentagon officials said today we think we have learned from him all we can learn said one senior official who declined to give details every little bit helps but this is not the intelligence gold mine that a lot of people are thinking a marine spokesman capt stewart upton said at camp rhino the marine base in afghanistan that mr walker was being held there as a battlefield detainee entitled to certain rights under the geneva convention which covers international conflicts he said mr walker was not available to journalists the international committee of the red cross would be able to visit him captain upton said we can not parade or showboat him under the geneva convention he said meanwhile the man whom mr walker 's parents have hired to be their son 's attorney james j brosnahan said today that his requests to see mr walker had gone unanswered reached at his home in berkeley calif mr brosnahan said that if john has done something helpful at this point as suggested by mr cheney it would be a good thing mr brosnahan a well known san francisco trial lawyer who helped prosecute the iran contra case said the defense department 's general counsel william j haynes ii had not replied to two letters mr brosnahan sent last week inquiring about mr walker 's situation pentagon officials said today that the department 's lawyers were still discussing with senior justice department officials how to deal with mr walker the goal is to figure out the right disposition for him said victoria clarke the chief pentagon spokeswoman one of mr brosnahan 's requests seems to have already been ignored i asked that they not interrogate him until he 's had a chance to talk to his attorney mr brosnahan said of his letters to mr haynes but mr walker 's right to an attorney is not clear because he is not in civilian custody he does n't have a right to a lawyer as a battlefield detainee said eugene r fidell a washington lawyer who specializes in military affairs to the extent he is not free to leave however any questioning could trigger his right to a lawyer under the supreme court 's miranda decision mr fidell added that the fifth amendment which protects americans from self incrimination could be a factor if mr walker 's case winds its way through the legal system there may be self incrimination implications mr fidell said if he is interrogated by us officials while in us military custody mr fidell and other legal experts say mr walker is in a kind of twilight zone caught amid three overlapping codes the laws of war military laws and federal criminal statutes because he is an american citizen he is not subject to prosecution under a military tribunal one of the legal remedies president bush has proposed in the war the legal uncertainties may help explain why the marine corps revised its description of mr walker 's status within a matter of hours remarks today by captain upton that mr walker was a battlefield detainee modified a previous statement issued late saturday night which said the detainee would be transferred to us civilian authorities as soon as possible any interrogation of mr walker is likely to include questions about what he knew of the violent rebellion late last month by taliban fighters held captive at a 19th century prison fortress near the afghan city of mazar i sharif johnny michael spann a central intelligence agency officer died in the revolt before his death mr spann had asked mr walker what he was doing there mr walker did not respond
 the government argued today that it was perfectly legal to hold an american citizen in custody without filing charges against him and without giving him access to a lawyer paul j mcnulty the united states attorney for the eastern district of virginia made the argument in connection with yaser esam hamdi who was born in louisiana raised in saudi arabia and captured on the battlefield in afghanistan mr hamdi was held in guantanamo bay cuba and transferred to the naval brig in norfolk va in april after the authorities confirmed that he had been born in the united states a lower court ruled that mr hamdi could have unfettered access to a court appointed public defender but the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit has twice prevented that in papers filed today mr mcnulty challenged the lower court ruling saying that it is well settled that the military has the authority to capture and detain individuals whom it has determined are enemy combatants and that such combatants have no right of access to counsel to challenge their detention such people he said can be detained for the duration of the conflict and their american citizenship is not relevant mr mcnulty quoted a 1956 appellate decision that said a petitioner 's american citizenship does not confer upon him any constitutional rights not accorded any other belligerent under the laws of war mr mcnulty said the courts had no business interfering with the decision of the military and the president regarding enemy combatants in addition he said the lower court 's order to allow mr hamdi unfettered access to a lawyer jeopardizes compelling national security interests in two ways first he said it is likely to interfere with if not irreparably harm the military 's ongoing efforts to gather intelligence that may help protect the homefront from further attacks second he said terrorists have trained their adherents to pass concealed messages through unwitting intermediaries the court appointed public defender frank w dunham jr is to respond to these arguments on thursday mr dunham has argued before that mr hamdi is entitled to representation and should be charged if he is to be detained so far judge robert g doumar of federal district court in norfolk has sided with him in another development a federal grand jury in virginia made slight alterations today in the indictment of zacarias moussaoui the only person charged in the sept 11 terrorist attacks by dropping charges dealing with crop dusting equipment and by expanding the number of countries in which he is said to have worked the so called superseding indictment issued today by the grand jury in alexandria va left in place the six major terrorism charges against mr moussaoui who is acting as his own trial lawyer the indictment was made public this evening and federal prosecutors did not return phone calls to explain why the grand jury had sought the new indictment which replaces an indictment issued last december defense lawyers who have been assigned to assist mr moussaoui said the only significant change in the indictment might be the addition of malaysia singapore and indonesia to the list of countries cited where al qaeda operated

 like many politicians william f galvin has retained advisers on matters of image style and political appeal i 've had many consultants said mr galvin the massachusetts official who is leading the investigation of credit suisse first boston the nice ones put it this way 'you know you 're a stiff the less nice ones say 'you come across as a monster you do n't smile enough you 're grim but mr galvin 52 who is running for a third term as secretary of the commonwealth after a failed democratic gubernatorial bid has made few concessions to the image makers and now credit suisse first boston along with fellow investigators like eliot spitzer the attorney general of new york are also discovering the steely and uncompromising side of this boston politician mr galvin has assigned 15 investigators roughly half the staff of his securities division as well as 11 law student interns to comb through more than 250000 internal credit suisse documents he has forwarded a pile of credit suisse e mail messages to mr spitzer suggesting that they may involve criminal violations that can be prosecuted under new york securities law and barring some kind of settlement with credit suisse his office is expected to file an administrative law complaint against the firm as early as monday over evidence that its investment bankers exerted improper influence over its research analysts what we have in the csfb material is that it 's apparently company policy to pitch to prospective banking clients the fact that they would shade the analysis mr galvin said credit suisse documents obtained by newspapers have suggested that analysts were paid a portion of investment banking revenue and that some analysts felt pressured to issue positive reports on credit suisse 's investment clients in a statement credit suisse said it has been working closely with all of our state and federal regulators who believe the public interest is best served by pursuing an industrywide global resolution on these matters we remain committed to achieving reform through this process massachusetts was given jurisdiction over the credit suisse inquiry by the north american securities administrators association which comprises state regulators but the state may not be interested in a so called global settlement such an agreement could resolve state as well as federal charges in return for fines and corporate reform mr spitzer called mr galvin on oct 3 to brief him on fledgling efforts to outline a broad settlement with the securities industry but mr galvin who has developed a reputation for toughness in local battles with hmo 's insurers and securities swindlers has made clear that he is not going to approve a slap on the wrist deal a global settlement rhetorically it sounds great but what does it mean he said for it to be meaningful it must be permanent change in the way these firms operate there 's been a tendency on the part of a lot of the larger firms to get into a problem like this pay a big fine throw up their hands and say we 're never going to do it again maybe fire a few people and then go out and find a more creative way to do what they just said they 'd never do again mr galvin said he wanted stiff financial penalties along with a total divorce of securities research and investment banking you almost have to treat these people like drug dealers he said in a recent interview you have to confiscate all their ill gotten gains mr galvin 's tough stand could partly reflect difficulties in talks with credit suisse according to people close to those talks credit suisse rejected an offer from the state to settle the investigation by paying a 100 million penalty but mr galvin said there 's been no settlement offer to my knowledge and i think my knowledge is complete credit suisse declined to comment mr galvin 's political colleagues are not surprised by his defiant tone in the multistate investigation which up to this point has been dominated by mr spitzer galvin 's clearly a guy who is quite independent persistent and determined said michael s dukakis the former massachusetts governor and presidential candidate michael w morrissey a state senator who has known mr galvin since they served together in the massachusetts house said he was always well prepared he 's the type of person that if you want to go to battle you want to make sure he 's on your side mr morrissey said he does his research he 's usually one or two steps ahead of everyone else politically however mr galvin has fallen a step or two behind his peers realizing that he was unlikely to receive enough democratic convention support to make the primary ballot he dropped his bid for governor in january mr galvin offered the explanation that everybody does n't think i 'm charming michael goldman a democratic political consultant who worked for some of mr galvin 's rivals seeking a primary nomination said he 's not a colorful guy he 's not the kind of boisterous back slapping irish politician people think of when they think of boston politicians mr galvin whose mother immigrated from ireland and whose american born father was raised in ireland attended parochial schools and boston college before earning a law degree at suffolk university an urban campus visible from his current statehouse perch on beacon hill before winning the first of seven terms in the massachusetts house mr galvin built a private practice as an election law expert which he described in a seemingly rare humorous foray as seasonal work since his 1994 election as secretary of the commonwealth mr galvin has worked to simplify and expand voter registration wary of problems with punchcard ballots mr galvin banned them in massachusetts in 1997 three years before they became an issue in the presidential election he knows election law cold said mr dukakis during the fight over the florida ballots campaign officials for al gore asked for mr galvin 's advice he urged them unsuccessfully to demand a statewide recount the gore folks made a big mistake to try to cherry pick where they thought they 'd win to pick up the margin mr galvin said you either recount it all or you do n't recount at all in recovering funds for victims of securities fraud and in requiring periodic exams of financial advisers he has earned a reputation as an investor champion but a sense of betrayal now reinforces his zeal during his first few years as secretary of the commonwealth his office was responsible for approving the sale of initial public offerings in massachusetts the national securities market improvement act of 1996 gave the federal government control over the approval process mr galvin said he would have approved far fewer stock offerings had he known how public offering allocations were abused i was taken in he said i do n't like being used i do n't like being deceived

 his boss left on an airplane late this afternoon without him steve park would have to find a much slower way to get back to north carolina i 'll hitchhike home if i have to park said beaming park who drives a chevrolet owned by the fussy dale earnhardt sr was held up because he finally won his first nascar winston cup race and earned the right to pose for photos spray champagne and jump up and down on the roof of his car the 32 year old native of east northport ny moved into contention early held his lead by virtue of a sensational pit stop then held off a thrilling late charge by the veteran mark martin to win the grueling temper testing global crossing at the glen by not much more than a car length afterward park received a thumbs up from martin and a visit in the victory circle from earnhardt for whom park has driven for nearly three seasons this was the same racetrack at which earnhardt first made note of park 's driving talent a few years ago now after 77 races an accident that cost him half the 1998 season and some shuffling of his crew park had his first victory he felt he had earned it a young guy like me is not used to the pressure of holding off a mark martin to win a race park said this was an exasperating day for almost everyone but park jeff gordon who had won a record six straight winston cup races on road courses including the last three here collided with tony stewart on the second of 90 laps and quickly fell from contention gordon finished 23rd when gordon pulled his mangled car next to stewart 's mangled car after the race stewart summoned him over and the two drivers swapped accusations as if they were still banging into each other on the track stewart pointing a finger and lacing each sentence with profanity accused gordon of reneging on his promise to avoid an accident early in the race you should practice what you preach stewart said later gordon said i made a clean move and i do n't think he wanted me to pass him maybe i was trying to go too hard too early but i think there could have been a little bit more consideration there earnhardt lost control of his chevrolet and spun into the styrofoam lined fence on lap 2 it was a costly accident for earnhardt who had been hoping to win his eighth winston cup championship he finished 25th with black tape holding the back of his car together and fell 217 points behind bobby labonte the leader in the points standing labonte finished fifth two spots ahead of dale jarrett and stretched his lead to a season best 101 points over jarrett with 13 races remaining i thought the car was going to be pretty good today but we 'll just have to forget about it now earnhardt said good drivers began to drop out in a hurry ron fellows the road course specialist who finished second to gordon at the glen last year moved to 15th from 40th in only 13 laps but abruptly dropped back because of engine trouble it looks like last year was a lot more difficult than we thought fellows said it 's a shame rusty wallace spun into the gravel next to the track jerry nadeau after moving to third from 25th to third place lost use of third gear ward burton fell from the top five after he was penalized because his crew forgot to put all the lug nuts on his tire park told himself to keep his composure and he moved up in the pack he started 18th but was in the top five after 25 laps he took the lead one third of the way into the race and gave it up briefly on his last pit stop but what a pit stop it was his crew needed only 154 seconds to refuel his car and change his tires labonte 's crew needed 172 seconds to do the same thing one lap later park found himself in the lead after everyone in the field had made his final stop and soon the race boiled down to park and martin martin closed on park 's rear bumper and stayed there as if his car had a magnet on it park said he tried to avoid the temptation to steal peeks in his rearview mirror to see where martin was park bobbled twice in the final laps once when his car appeared to be nudged by jeff burton 's but he kept the lead when he crossed the finish line park remembered to stick his hand out of the car and wave to the crowd he forgot to shift though and his car protested with a sudden pop that was about the only thing that went amiss today for park he was asked after the race if he told his boss now long gone that he had won one more race at watkins glen than the great earnhardt had park smiled again the boss is still the boss i would n't want to tell dale earnhardt anything that he would n't want to hear park said he still signs my paychecks
 the senate today began debating a 10 year 171 billion farm bill a democratic measure that the bush administration said would undercut foreign trade encourage overproduction and depress already low grain and cotton prices the bill sponsored by senator tom harkin the iowa democrat who is chairman of the agriculture committee includes increases in conservation and environmental programs that are intended to win the support of lawmakers from eastern states the proposed increases won praise today from advocacy groups that oppose a republican sponsored farm bill passed by the house in october senator harkin 's revised farm bill will reward farmers and ranchers when they help improve water quality restore wildlife habitat and serve as the front line against suburban sprawl said scott faber of environmental defense but several republican lawmakers complained that the bill did little to change an imbalance in the current subsidy system that favors the top 8 percent of farmers who receive nearly half of the 20 billion in annual subsidies we literally have a program in this bill where we drive up prices of milk for children in order to increase subsidies for dairy farmers who have assets on average of over 800000 said senator phil gramm republican of texas still lawmakers by 73 to 26 rebuffed a move to end debate on the bill which would involve spending an average of 17 billion a year compared with current spending of about 20 billion a year the debate begun today is the culmination of months of arguments over the direction of american farm policy and whether the depression era subsidy program should be overhauled in favor of more conservation and environmental programs representative larry combest a texas republican who sponsored the house bill urged the senate today to vote on its bill before the end of the week to ensure that a compromise between the two measures could be reached before the end of the year democratic senators and republican house members have been pushing for a new farm bill even though the current law does not expire for nine months in trying to prevent debate today senator richard g lugar republican of indiana and the ranking minority member of the agriculture committee argued that the only reason for passing a 171 billion farm bill now when the country was fighting a war on terrorism and facing budget deficits at home was to allow his fellow lawmakers to position themselves as friends of the farmer in next year 's election mr lugar lost that argument to influential lawmakers from other farm states who contended that farmers were in the midst of a crisis our farmers are in a desperate struggle for survival up against european rivals who receive three times the subsidies our farmers receive said senator kent conrad democrat of north dakota the administration has opposed both the house and senate farm bills agriculture secretary ann m veneman urged the senate to approve an alternative measure sponsored by senator pat roberts republican of kansas and senator thad cochran republican of mississippi they propose giving farmers more money in annual payments and savings accounts rather than crop subsidies

 sabena belgium 's ailing national airline said today that it would cut 1600 jobs more than 10 percent of its work force and drop unprofitable flights to washington tokyo and other cities in a final effort to avoid collapse sabena 's chief executive christophe mueller said he also planned to sell ancillary businesses like food service and cargo handling and to drop nine jets from sabena 's fleet he presented the rescue plan to employees today as a second day of unofficial strikes disrupted operations at the airline 's hub at zaventem airport more than half of sabena 's short haul flights were canceled because of the job actions the future of sabena rests now on our shoulders mr mueller told the employees we have no other choice than to adapt our organization to new circumstances sabena 's owners the belgian government with 505 percent and swissair group with 495 percent agreed last month to inject 430 million euros about 3785 million to finance the rescue plan the airline 's second emergency recapitalization this year swissair withheld support for the latest rescue until sabena and the belgian government agreed to drop litigation against it for backing out of a promise to increase its stake in sabena to 85 percent without this plan there will be no survival for sabena we would go straight into concordat mr mueller said referring to the belgian equivalent of chapter 11 bankruptcy protection sabena has lost money in 39 of the last 40 years mr mueller said previous attempts to turn sabena around failed because they aimed only to make the airline break even the latest plan is different from others before mr mueller said this is n't just a turnround it is a complete restructuring with a new strategy he said meant to achieve profitability by 2005 the main aim is to raise the percentage of seats filled to the levels of its rivals we reduced the gap on long haul flights during the first half of this year but apart from that sabena has never come any closer to the average in the industry mr mueller said to do it the airline will drop six yet to be named routes in europe and concentrate its long range jets on profitable routes like those linking brussels with new york boston and some cities in africa mr mueller also said he wanted sabena to move away from selling cheap tickets to bargain hunters and focus instead on high yield time sensitive passengers mainly business travelers by stepping up service on certain routes while abandoning others dominated by big first tier rivals like lufthansa and british airways ultimately he would like to make sabena healthy enough to join a big alliance like british airways one world or lufthansa 's star but there are 15 second tier airlines that all want this mr mueller said it wo n't happen for all of us

 in a letter accompanying the budget plan he released last month gov george e pataki upheld the importance of jobs and vowed his proposal preserves promised tax cuts and avoids job killing tax increases so that businesses will stay in new york and flourish but after reading the fine print some lobbyists lawmakers and labor and business leaders said they have found a contradiction the budget is less business friendly than it may first appear while the governor has avoided calling for across the board corporate or income tax increases he does propose 14 billion in new fees and surcharges that would hit the insurance and health care industries hard and affect other businesses like tire sales and nuclear power advocates for those industries and some lawmakers said it would raise the cost of doing business here perhaps resulting in job loss or even the flight of businesses from the state the complaints are part of the negotiation process that goes on after a governor 's budget is introduced and the legislature is about to put its stamp on the annual spending plan but the fees are the biggest boost of new revenue in a budget proposed to close a cumulative 115 billion gap a large chunk or about 400 million worth are levied on the insurance industry with the governor proposing among other things a 52 million to 117 million increase in surcharges on policies for auto insurers a 35 million increase in assessments on state insurers to pay for an increase in the state 's insurance department budget and millions more in increases on the surcharges that health plans must pay despite his facile rhetoric condemning job killing taxes the governor 's budget adds over 400 million in taxes assessments fees and mandates on insurers of all types said assemblyman alexander b grannis a democrat from manhattan who is the insurance committee chairman as sure as night follows day insurers will pass these new costs on to consumers mr pataki 's proposed menu of surcharges also includes a 400000 increase in the annual fee paid by nuclear plant operators that is estimated to raise 24 million for the state another proposal would add a 225 fee for every new tire sold raising 45 million as for the health care industry the budget not only cuts medicaid which reimburses providers of medical services for the poor it also temporarily reinstates charges on hospital revenues to raise 1922 million and on home care services to raise 17 million each would be reduced by 25 percent annually and phased out by 2007 according to the plan i am not going to say to you that it is the budget i would have crafted said mark p alesse director of the state chapter of the national federation of independent business which represents 13 million small businesses in new york if i had drafted it it would have cut spending more dramatically and i would not have included anything that would have increased the cost of insurance in proposing a 908 billion spending plan that slightly shrinks the size of state government the governor has pledged to fight against efforts to tax our way back to fiscal health in a series of speeches made in the week before the budget was released last month he repeatedly said that raising taxes to balance the state 's books would cause businesses to flee new york in fact he vowed to cut taxes further to attract businesses the governor 's goal said past and current advisers is to create a fiscal climate in new york that allows business to flourish thus pulling the state from the economic doldrums that created the budget gap the actions mr pataki is proposing for the next fiscal year which begins april 1 will enable the state to spend on programs later the advisers said further they said the governor 's budget includes a sweetener for the insurance companies even as it seeks more money from them the governor has offered an additional 125 million in tax credits for insurance companies that provide funding for new small companies in the tech and biotech fields officials said but officials in the health care and insurance industries say they are the economic engines of the state accounting for some one million jobs in the state 's work tforce of eight million according to the latest statistics available from the state 's labor department driving up their costs will further depress the economy by forcing them to lay off workers and pass costs on to consumers they argue for the health care industry the combined impact of increased fees and 500 million in medicaid cuts would have a devastating economic impact industry representatives said it is safe to say that these cuts would close hospitals said kenneth e raske the president of the greater new york hospital association craig m burridge the executive director of the pharmacists society of the state of new york said that the budget cuts would cause 1500 independent pharmacies to close and prompt the loss of 12600 jobs in the field mostly in new york city an analysis by aides to assembly speaker sheldon silver found that the cuts to medicaid would lead to the loss of 38000 jobs overall in health care the budget is not business friendly in the context of the health care industry which is the largest industry in the state in terms of jobs mr raske said i think that the governor is totally sincere in his mind about the need to grow jobs he said but he added the government funding formulas for health care are so complicated that the impact of mr pataki 's budget proposals is more severe some in the insurance industry are withholding their criticism hoping to negotiate a deal with the governor and legislature to spare the industry hundreds of millions of dollars in new fees still thomas e workman the president of the life insurance council of new york a nonprofit trade association said he was perplexed by the budget we really do believe it was not thought through to fully understand how it would impact us especially the companies based here in new york he said some of our larger members are household words or household names he said they are gems for this state and we want to foster their success we want to encourage their success not unintentionally impair their success he added i have tried not to say that we are going to pick up our marbles and go away that is not what you say when you are looking for relief or some more reasonable proposal

 the ease of driving a car equipped with an automatic transmission makes automatics the overwhelming favorite of american motorists but while the hydra matic 4t40 e transmissions moving down the final assembly line at a general motors factory in windsor ontario may be simple to use they are far from simple to design and build flipped upward like cast aluminum cornucopias the partly assembled transmission bodies are fed a harvest of gears chains springs electronics and wires exactly how the pieces come together to shift gears is something of a mystery even to the people who make the transmissions which are soon to be installed in chevrolet cavaliers oldsmobile aleros and other cars when asked about the specifics of the torque converter the link between the transmission and the engine the plant 's engineering manager don wright laughed as for how it works you 'll have to ask someone else he said i 'm the guy who knows how to make them but what sets the 4t40 e apart from older models is not the intricacy of its mechanical and hydraulic systems rather it is a box tethered to the transmission by a wire inside a sophisticated microprocessor uses special software to replace the electromechanical systems that once controlled automatic transmissions by moving to electronic controls transmission makers have not only been able to introduce new features like additional gear ratios and transmissions that adapt to different driving styles but have also narrowed the efficiency and performance gap between automatics and manual transmissions mark gilmore the director of transmission development at gm 's powertrain division acknowledged that the all mechanical automatics that were being produced by the company when he joined it in 1977 probably deserved their popular pejorative name slush buckets but today he said there is legitimate debate on how they compare with manual transmissions i think we 're now certainly very close with automatics he said whether manual or automatic transmissions perform two basic jobs at low speeds they allow the drive shaft that powers the wheels to rotate at a lower rate than the engine 's drive shaft doing that creates the force known as torque needed to accelerate the car at higher speeds the situation reverses to prevent the engine from running inefficiently the transmission creates a final drive shaft rotational speed that is higher than the engine drive shaft 's rate the first automatic and semiautomatic transmissions appeared in the years before world war ii but they were largely experimental and not particularly successful they provided acceleration that could best be described as stately said bob casey curator of transportation at the henry ford museum and greenfield village in dearborn mich then in 1939 the first gm hydra matic appeared and it became available on oldsmobiles during the next year it used a hydraulic system to make gear changes based on a complex set of factors including the vacuum pressure of the engine 's exhaust manifold the car 's speed and the engine throttle setting all measured mechanically various springs opened and closed hydraulic pistons to shift gears it was just insanely complicated yet the transmissions became extremely reliable mr casey said one of mr gilmore 's first jobs as a junior engineer at gm was to adapt transmissions to different engines by changing their springs and pistons i used to carry a little suitcase around filled with hardware he said eliminating that fiddly process was one reason that gm and other transmission makers started looking at electronics it also quickly became apparent that electronics offered ways to boost performance automatic transmissions like manual ones need to uncouple themselves from the engine when shifting rather than use a mechanical clutch basically two abrasive discs that press against each other the torque converter makes its coupling between the engine and the transmission with hydraulic fluid when a car is accelerating fluid couplings can boost engine torque but at higher speeds they put the slush into slush box the obvious solution introducing a mechanical connection that kicks in at highway speeds was difficult without electronic controls the first gm transmission to have all of its gear changes controlled by electronics did not appear until 1989 transmission software has become so sophisticated that it can now determine if a car is climbing a hill a situation that often baffled transmissions in the past and study drivers patterns to see if they prefer sporty acceleration or sedate but economical driving our goal is to have the customer not even realize the transmission is doing a whole lot of things mr gilmore said
 so has ebay put itself up for the ultimate auction probably not financiers close to ebay said yesterday the morning after cnbc carried a report that the company was in talks that could lead to an acquisition of the auction site by yahoo the big web portal but they said ebay was still trying to figure out a deal that would let it tap into yahoo 's huge audience of internet users as it had already done with america online and disney 's go network an outright sale is far less likely because ebay 's 26 billion market value makes it an expensive prize even a limited deal that would put ebay auctions on yahoo 's site would be complex as yahoo now has the no 2 auction service and while analysts said rumors about a possible merger had sent both stocks higher in recent days investors yesterday appeared to conclude that a deal was unlikely analysts said ebay 's stock closed at 18952 off 2148 from tuesday 's close while yahoo fell to 15850 a decline of 1025 then again on the internet anything is possible and certainly there have been any number of cases where companies that began to talk about small deals wound up at the altar and few analysts would have predicted that america online and time warner would be able to come to merger terms given the disparities of their stock market valuations what 's more analysts and financiers say a combination of yahoo and ebay two of the few profitable internet companies is in fact more sensible than many possible deals bandied about since the america online time warner pact yahoo despite a 35 percent drop in stock price since the start of the year still has a market value of 96 billion big enough to buy almost any company willing to take its stock but yahoo has steadfastly insisted that its best opportunity is to be a switzerland of the web linking to information from a wide range of sources devoting more resources to creating its own information or entertainment or even buying a media company it argues is simply a burden that will drag down its high margins and it is counting on its brand to continue to drive traffic rather than owning or being owned by a telecommunications company many wonder whether yahoo will be able to maintain this strategy as the focus of the internet shifts from pages of text to audio and video delivered over high speed connections aol is betting that it is better to own both the content from time warner 's television movie and music properties and the distribution from the company 's cable systems yahoo by contrast has maintained its model buying broadcast com which maintains links to a wide range of audio and video content by others and it just started financevision a daily internet video feed on business and stock market news it does have live anchors but they act as a human search engine providing introductions and links to video feeds provided by others the one place where yahoo 's strategy has shifted over the years is that it increasingly wants to earn fees from linking buyers and sellers together both in its shopping channel and in its auction service this approach to electronic commerce can have much higher margins than the messy and expensive business of running warehouses and holding inventory that amazoncom is in and no one has proved the potential of such an electronic marketplace as well as ebay which has transformed an electronic flea market of classified advertising into a huge rapidly growing and profitable community of buyers and sellers ebay 's growth has continued even in the face of competition from amazon the web 's biggest store and yahoo which lets sellers list items free ebay and amazon charge listing fees and take a percentage of each completed sale so ebay analysts say is perhaps the best single acquisition target for yahoo it would make it the undisputed leader in person to person commerce while keeping the company focused on the internet i do n't think a traditional media company would dovetail with yahoo 's vision but ebay would give them a great way to monetize their large user base said paul noglows an analyst with chase h q of course the biggest stumbling block for yahoo is the price henry blodget merrill lynch 's internet analyst suggested that yahoo could pay up to 300 a share for ebay or 40 billion without suffering any significant dilution in its earnings but others question whether yahoo which has a reputation for being extraordinarily cheap would be willing to give up what would be 30 percent of the equity in the combined company to get ebay for ebay by contrast the issue is whether the company needs to link with a broader service the strategic question for ebay is what comes after auctions said jim breyer a partner at venture firm accel partners to justify their valuation they have to get bold about their strategy and move beyond that others argue that ebay has plenty of growth left in recent weeks it expanded its auction model to other markets including used cars and business equipment if ebay stays independent it can become a much bigger company than it is today said jamie kiggen a donaldson lufkin jenrette analyst the bear case on ebay rested primarily on the idea their opportunity was not very large just in the last two weeks they have shown they can identify new markets still ebay is constantly looking for ways to expand its audience and head off potential competitors as much as a year ago even as yahoo was readying its own auction site ebay executives were holding exploratory conversations with the company about how to capitalize on yahoo 's extensive distribution network then the dialogue centered mostly on a strategic partnership although the two companies flirted with the idea of a potential merger those talks faltered though and yahoo and ebay soon found themselves competitors in the online auction market after that ebay negotiated and subsequently expanded an arrangement with america online to operate auctions on all of aol 's various services and this year disney 's go network abandoned its own auction plans and decided to offer links to ebay instead ebay obviously would love to gain access to yahoo 's audience as well the second largest on the internet after america online but analysts say such a deal would be more complex than the ebay arrangements with aol and disney as it would have to find a way to account for yahoo 's existing auction service perhaps analysts said ebay could buy yahoo auctions for some combination of cash or ebay shares ebay and yahoo officials declined to discuss any potential business arrangements sara farley an e commerce analyst at painewebber said it might be smartest for ebay to partner with as many companies as possible and not limit itself to an alliance with a single company in this market they do n't know who the next newcomer will be she said they do n't want to limit their options

 the bloomberg administration is trying to choose among several candidates for the post of special schools investigator which became vacant when edward f stancik the job 's first and only occupant died last month dennis m walcott the deputy mayor for education declined yesterday to reveal the names of the people being considered but said that they were of very high quality and of varied backgrounds including some with prosecutorial experience critics have expressed the hope that the vacancy could give mayor michael r bloomberg a chance to deal with complaints that the investigator 's office lacked sufficient accountability to a higher authority which led to what they regarded as some overzealous investigations the special investigator who reports to the city 's investigations commissioner but not to the board of education can subpoena witnesses interrogate them and draw up public reports alleging wrongdoing but he does not have the obligation to prove his charges in a court mr walcott said it would be up to rose gill hearn the commissioner of the city 's department of investigation to consider whether such criticism warranted a reconfiguration of the office the office was created by mayor david n dinkins in 1990 in response to complaints that the board of education 's in house investigative arm was bumbling and passive ms gill hearn through a spokesman keith schwam said she was pleased with the caliber of the applicants for the office but would not discuss whether she planned any changes but other officials indicated that a formal change in the statute creating the office was unlikely they said the language of the statute allowed the city 's investigations commissioner to exercise stronger control over the special investigator if she wanted during his 12 year tenure mr stancik helped bring about some important systemwide changes including a state law that diminished the powers of new york city 's 32 local school boards several of which he exposed as corrupt however critics said he was a canny user of the news media and some chancellors accused him of bundling together cases to make the wrongdoing described appear more systemic than it was kasumi parker a spokeswoman for the special investigator 's office said that since mr stancik 's death on march 12 the office has been run by regina loughran who was mr stancik 's deputy commissioner she said the work of the office has been absolutely business as usual

 it was the night before christmas a few years ago the adults were larking at the bar and supper buffet in the dining room while the children were playing upstairs in a less trafficked corner i was admiring my host 's christmas tree when a little girl about 6 appeared we had both gone awol from the festivities hello i said what 's your name my new friend did not respond she stood with her hands pressed defiantly on her hips at her feet was a miss kitty book bag the tree is pretty do n't you think she shrugged nice dress i offered complimenting her crisp party frock she scratched behind her neck where the dress label was rubbing the little girl looked left she looked right then like a magician plucking a rabbit she pulled a tattered madras jersey shift from her bag and slipped it over her party dress she exhaled and seemed relieved this simple old dress like magic made her happy not all little girls like to doll up but then mom appeared take that dress off why do n't you like your beautiful new dress mother wondered the little girl very sorry said she did not know a few weeks later i went to paris to write about the couture collections it was the height of the late 1990 's go go gold rush people did not come to paris in those days to praise the simplicity of perfect made to order fashion but instead to snowboard hot dog style in an avalanche of haute designer metaphors and high jinks eliza dolittle at the moulin rouge pocahontas on the orient express something borrowed and something blue the marriage of wilma flintstone to marat sade some of the clothes were beautiful some were downright peculiar they were complex and conceptual suffice it to say there was nothing to wear to your local chapter of the voluntary simplicity movement from one fashion show extravaganza to the next and then on the return flight home the image of the little girl at the christmas party and her one perfect dress played prominently in my mind it was an entertaining jostle between a little girl 's simple comfort versus 1000 designer concoctions in a consumer society where more is always the new better enjoying one perfectly simple thing is nearly an act of courage when it is n't the response to necessity and when an adult tells you he or she is on a quest for one perfect thing dress shoe macaroni and cheese recipe it usually has more to do with a fetish than a new lease on walden pond but there is a spell of time when children are innocent shoppers choosing what they like rather than what they are told they need by peers and marketers bubbles balls stickers teddy bears balloons magic dresses these are some of children 's favorite things the simpler the object is the better after exhausting themselves to find the best and brightest toy what parent has not felt frustrated when a child plays with only the box there is a reason simple things are so compelling simpler toys leave room for a child to try out her own dreams and wishes explain the child experts t berry brazelton and joshua d sparrow authors of touchpoints three to six with simple toys a child feels ready to face her world of transitions without it she must rely on adults who ca n't always be there no matter how reliable they are the little girl 's dress at the christmas party was hardly couture although that would have pleased her mother it was a tattered madras shmatte and it was her talisman it empowered her and why not is n't every dress from the newest of the new to the oldest of the old meant to be some kind of hope on a hanger style william norwich the entertaining editor of the magazine is author of the coming molly and the magic dress
 as a famous actor danny glover is used to getting all sorts of charity requests so when orel lee brown a widowed mother of two asked him to speak to a group of her students in a drug infested area of oakland calif he took the request in stride when an opening finally came up in his schedule and mr glover went to see ms brown he was amazed and moved by what he encountered in 1987 ms brown a real estate agent had promised a group of first graders that she 'd pay for their college educations if they stayed in school they fulfilled their end of the bargain and she was preparing to spend everything she had to keep her word little did i know this woman chaperoned kids from kindergarten and got them on their way to state colleges black colleges said mr glover i was so moved by the way she 'd basically taken on the responsibility for 19 young lives i was completely blown away i realized you never know the full story unless you look closer he wanted to let the world know about this woman 's remarkable story and now he 'll have that opportunity mr glover is a co producer and host of courage a series that begins this week with four consecutive episodes monday through thursday at 9 pm and continues on monday nights at 9 on the fox family channel this is a family program he said with pride it brings out certain values caring sharing that we are our brother 's keeper this uses the reality format which is popular right now but really sees the potential in people we understand the struggles everyone we 're profiling goes through in some way we can identify what they 're going through with something in our own lives most lives however are never tested the way those of the people in courage have been the show includes segments on rudy garcia an 11 year old who had both of his legs removed because of crippling disease but is now a champion runner and swimmer jill cook a 66 year old crossing guard who threw herself in front of a speeding truck to save the lives of two children dennis worsham a 52 year old firefighter who donated a kidney to save the life of a paramedic he barely knew and ammie murray a grandmother who has crusaded to save a frequently vandalized church where freed slaves used to worship in secret the stories are unabashedly sentimental and mr glover makes no apologies for that you get moved by these people and you do n't need to be ashamed of that he said you get to see the intensity of real life when the show 's producers came to mr glover with the concept for courage asking him to be the show 's host the idea he said was to do a series that was more of an adrenaline rush it was rescue stuff women who saved babies in earthquakes that sort of thing he said while keeping stories like that in the mix mr glover saw the possibility of doing the series with a more activist approach his hope is that instead of just watching and then changing the channel at the end of the hour viewers may feel inspired to do more with their own lives every one of these people felt they could make a difference he said whether their acts were spontaneous like saving the kids at a school bus stop or deliberate like the man i met who travels around the world riding in bicycle tours to raise money for aids research they wanted to do something even before courage went on the air its offices were receiving a steady stream of suggestions for stories the show 's staff also regularly scans newspapers from around the country in search of inspirational tales to tell these are stories about what we should be like as human beings mr glover said the good is out there and society does n't often spend a lot of time elevating that good the more we can do that on this show as well as in our lives the better off we 'll all be

 it has been a near constant refrain since sept 11 life will never be the same and yesterday city officials raised the possibility that one inconvenience the partial ban on single occupancy vehicles entering manhattan might become permanent it 's an intriguing question said iris weinshall the transportation commissioner have we thought about it yeah ms weinshall who appeared at a news conference with mayor rudolph w giuliani made her comments while announcing that the restrictions in place since sept 27 would be loosened today instead of prohibiting single occupancy vehicles from 6 am to 11 am on weekdays the ban has been shortened by an hour to end at 10 am vehicle counts in the area affected below 63rd street have shown a 23 percent reduction in traffic ms weinshall said making the current restrictions permanent might be easier said than done since they were enacted under emergency powers granted to mayor giuliani since sept 11 and without the special consent of the state legislature city motor vehicle laws are subject to state oversight and such consent would be required a ban is something the next mayor should take a hard look at ms weinshall said thomas j lueck
 with mayor michael r bloomberg still struggling to win control of the public school system the board of education announced yesterday that it planned to vote next week on schools chancellor harold o levy 's contract ninfa segarra the board president said she hoped that mr bloomberg would let her know by thursday the day of the scheduled vote whether he wants mr levy to stay and for how long she scheduled the vote for thursday may 30 she said because the board is required to decide mr levy 's fate by june 1 if they do not act by then his contract will automatically be extended for a year earlier this week mr bloomberg told reporters that he and mr levy would discuss the chancellor 's contract before june 1 and presumably decide how long he should stay past june 30 when the contract expires but the mayor is still focused on his negotiations to win control of the school system and has said he hopes to strike a deal with the state legislature before he makes any other education related decision we are urging city hall to make clear to us what they would like us to do because we consider ourselves partners with the mayor ms segarra said yesterday at the same time i have seven members who have a fiduciary responsibility to meet this obligation of doing something about the contract ms segarra said that six of the seven board members including herself did not want to renew mr levy 's contract because they felt he had not improved the school system during his two years on the job but she added if the mayor told us to renew the contract we would ms segarra said that she told city hall about the vote before scheduling it through a spokesman mr bloomberg declined to comment yesterday as did mr levy june 1 is also the date by which the mayor and the five borough presidents are supposed to appoint new members to the board of education but deputy mayor dennis m walcott said earlier this week that city hall had sought a legal opinion on the issue and decided that the appointments could be delayed if the mayor had not won control of the system by then in fact mr bloomberg appears eager to close a deal in the next week so that he can make decisions about the chancellorship without going through the board under a plan that both houses of the legislature have agreed to he would appoint 8 members of a new 13 member board of education one of his members would be the chancellor who would report directly to him mr bloomberg wants the reconfigured board to have almost no say over policy although a bill that he helped write and the republican controlled state senate has introduced would allow the board to vote on any school privatization or voucher program but sheldon silver the democratic speaker of the assembly is resisting parts of mr bloomberg 's proposal he is pushing for the new board to have a say in budgetary and policy decisions he also insisted that mr bloomberg promise not to reduce the city 's spending on its public schools from one year to the next the final sticking point is over the 32 community school boards which mr bloomberg originally said should be abolished immediately and replaced with a system that assured more parental involvement now he has agreed to delay getting rid of them until public hearings can be held but in the meantime he wants to sharply reduce the boards role in hiring superintendents mr silver is balking saying such a move would strip the local elected boards and the communities they represent of their last remaining power to shape their schools mr silver also maintains that the justice department would have to approve any change in the powers of community school boards since manhattan the bronx and brooklyn fall under the federal voting rights act the two men talked again yesterday in a meeting they both characterized as productive but said they did not resolve the outstanding issues assemblyman steven sanders chairman of the assembly education committee said the meeting was primarily a chance for mr bloomberg and mr silver to mend fences after negotiations broke down earlier in the week the purpose of this conversation was to try to get their discussions back on track mr sanders said and to make one last effort to see if we can arrive at a consensus over the next few days or weeks the two sides will talk again today and mr bloomberg 's aides will hold a collective bargaining session with the city teachers union which has gone 18 months without a contract and has threatened to strike in september

 the budget gap for the state university of new york 's hospitals has ballooned to 230 million about 13 percent of suny 's operating budget but the university is not asking for any state subsidies to close that gap according to the university 's budget request for next year which was released yesterday the university plans to borrow from the state to cover the gap as it has for the last two years while it continues to try to solve the problem university officials said h carl mccall the state comptroller has expressed concern that if suny does not press the governor and the legislature for money to close the gap the university may have to raise tuition or reduce the amount of money spent on instruction so far however the university has relied largely on borrowing to close the gap suny is seeking a 18 billion operating budget for its 30 state operated and statutory colleges next year a 132 million increase or 75 percent the university has turned to consultants at pricewaterhousecoopers for advice on how the gap might be closed but the consultants concluded earlier this year that the gap could not be closed by the hospitals themselves edward f cox a suny trustee and chairman of the board 's finance and administration committee said that suny had sought to give its hospitals more flexibility to compete with private hospitals and bring in more revenue unfortunately there has been no reaction from the political community he said so we have this problem there is not much more we can do as trustees the rest of the budget message was generally more upbeat of the 132 million budget increase suny is seeking 42 million is for contractual increases for faculty and staff it is also asking for 50 million for new initiatives including 40 million to improve quality and 5 million to help colleges that are struggling to shift their missions brian t stenson suny 's vice chancellor for finance and business said yesterday at a meeting of the finance and administration committee that suny would like to change its financial structure so the operating budget of the university does not depend on the payments of the hospitals suny officials say their problems stem from the state 's requirement that suny 's medical centers in stony brook brooklyn and syracuse pay 116 million a year to cover fringe benefits for their employees a sum they were once able to pay but can no longer afford because of belt tightening brought about by the growth of managed care instead of paying the money directly to the state the hospitals are supposed to pay the money to suny if the hospitals fall short as they have for several years suny must scramble to cover the shortfall in any way it can two years ago the hospitals paid 39 million of the 116 million assessment leaving a 77 million gap last year they paid that 77 million plus 2 million of the next 116 million assessment they entered the current fiscal year with a 114 million bill from last year on top of the 116 million they owe for this year mr stenson said that suny did not know what the hospitals would be able to pay this year the state has not always asked the hospitals to cover employee benefits in the 1980 's the state subsidized the hospitals which serve as teaching hospitals for medical students and provide care for the indigent in 1990 the state stopped paying the subsidy two years later it asked the hospitals which then had financial surpluses to share their bounty but changes in the economics of health care in recent years have turned surpluses into red ink for many hospitals including suny 's john clarkson deputy director for fiscal research and policy analysis in the comptroller 's office said that the university could not continue to roll the obligation over year after year eventually they 'll run out of room to borrow he said
 regulators may soon open a new front in their investigation of possible wrongdoing at mutual funds focusing on the role of lawyers who represent them a senior securities and exchange commission official said yesterday an attorney who is aware of credible evidence of a material violation of the securities laws or a material breach of fiduciary duty must report this evidence up the chain of command if necessary to independent members of the fund 's board said harvey j goldschmid the sec commissioner in a speech before the investment company institute the mutual fund trade group in washington for those who do not he said the commission has available its traditional broad spectrum of remedies penalties and other sanctions mr goldschmid 's comments come as regulators continue to uncover questionable practices by fund managers his remarks are a warning for lawyers who represent funds that they have increased responsibilities as a result of sec rules that took effect in august the whole tenor of his speech is you are the law 's gatekeeper said tamar frankel a law professor at boston university you are public servants you 're not selling justice and you 're not selling income producing property that means you have to tell the client sometimes 'i know you want to do it but you know something you ca n't no one has yet asserted that specific lawyers representing particular funds knew of possibly unethical behavior by managers said paul schott stevens a partner in the washington office of dechert what is more mr stevens said no one has charged that a lawyer knew that fund managers permitted after hours trading by certain favored investors or that the managers allowed some investors to buy and sell fund shares rapidly that practice known as market timing drives up costs for other shareholders it is not clear that all forms of late trading and market timing were violations of securities laws and that lawyers who learned of such practices should have reported them said robert pietrzak a litigation partner in the new york office of sidley austin brown wood if there is evidence in an area where the law is highly unsettled the question of whether or not there is a material violation may be a very significant question the answer to which will vary from case to case mr pietrzak said because the questionable practices uncovered by the mutual fund investigations are not clearly illegal they present exactly what lawyers feared would result from the sec 's new rules said john k villa a partner at williams connolly who frequently represents large law firms lawyers action or inaction could be analyzed and criticized with the benefit of hindsight he said there 's a certain irony that the paradigm case that corporate lawyers have been so concerned about is the one that is immediately presented under the new rules mr villa said

 art arising from ashes the busy visitors lobby of the united nations is now filled with ghosts some are of victims of war but many also belong to the living the ghosts of childhoods lost aftershocks a show presented there by the children 's movement for creative education consists of art and memoirs by two groups with good reason to mourn teenagers from the former yugoslavia and new york city children who saw the terrorist attacks of sept 11 their creations communicate many of the same emotions evoking fear and sadness but also resilience the balkan works range from edin durmisevic 's cocoon a cluster of teenagers plaster life masks that eerily recall the faceless dead to lea bebek 's war recipes a darkly comic parody that calls for preparing meager rations on fires fed by old shoes the names by emir durmisevic edin 's twin looks like a city banner it says sarajevo trailing streamers a closer examination reveals that the strips of paper are printed with the names of 10000 civilians killed on the floor is a map of europe splattered with red in breezes the streamers sway haunting and wraithlike the art by the new yorkers who are much younger is no less poignant it includes daniella d'agate 's eyes of the world are watching in which disembodied eyes look on as a plane hurtles toward the twin towers and a drawing by two sixth graders in which the sun and clouds are faces streaked with tears but the spirit of hope dwells here too in art and in words and of course in the children themselves who have the potential to right earlier generations wrongs as i am a

 it was not too long ago when consumers could easily appease their creditors by simply advising the check is in the mail but the internet is making it harder to come up with excuses about a dozen person to person online payment services from systems offered by citibank and western union to a web based venture called paypal have emerged over the last year or so they allow consumers to transfer money quickly online through their bank accounts or credit cards whether to settle a dinner check send spending money to a college student or pay for an online auction purchase recipients are notified by e mail sometimes with the proclamation you 've got cash it 's one of the fastest growing internet services out there said paul jamieson director of financial services at gomez advisors a research firm based in lincoln mass that ranks e commerce sites the idea of person to person payment services which have both good and bad points found its footing in online auctions where a speedy payment system is crucial to completing fast paced transactions jenanne hassler who is both a buyer and a seller on the ebay auction site and earns her living selling lingerie over the internet said she started using paypal for her online bidding purchases ms hassler 32 of waynesville nc now uses it routinely for a variety of payments even to send cash birthday gifts to friends to me it seems like the perfect and most convenient way to say 'i love you here 's 15 she said it 's very quick and very easy gary j caruso commissioner of the congressional softball league since the early 1980 's said that this year the league is offering paypal as an option for paying fees we have a postal box and sometimes the mail just disappears he said adding that one 1999 registration and fee did not show up in the regular mail until the fall of 2000 most of the online services use the same basic principle both parties to a transaction must have e mail addresses the person sending the money registers with the service to establish an account and provides the number of a credit card or bank account from which the money will be drawn after the sender pays the recipient receives an e mail notification in most cases the recipient must also register with the service and then designate a method for receiving payment the money can be transferred into a bank account credited to a credit card account or mailed by check generally recipients can also hold the money in an online account set up with the service at registration the money can then be transferred around the internet and used for other purposes although a transaction is noted immediately in a recipient 's e mail it usually takes about three days for the money to actually arrive in a bank account and from 7 to 10 days for a check to arrive through the mail to address that delay some companies have started issuing debit cards which allow recipients to gain access to their funds immediately through automated teller machines ms hassler who recently received her debit card uses her paypal account to accumulate payments from her ebay sales she says she eventually will use the account for everyday purchases like groceries while the offerings are generally similar pricing is different paypal which was started 15 months ago and is a leader in the field with 75 million users actually pays users 5 to register the basic service is free for personal use businesses or individuals who sign up for a premier account which includes additional features like debit cards pay 30 cents for payments of 15 or less and 30 cents plus 22 percent of the amount on payments over 15 vince sollitto a spokesman for paypal said that nearly 80 percent of the accounts belonged to businesses and that 50 percent of their traffic came from online auctions the c2it service from citibank a unit of citigroup started a year ago it is free for the first 90 days and then costs 2 a transaction but the bank says it plans to change its pricing structure eventually to a small flat fee plus a percentage of the transaction moneyzap western union 's online person to person payment system began last july and is free for now but the company a unit of first data says it is developing a payment structure both c2it and moneyzap have 30000 to 40000 users according to analysts western union which has been in the money transfer business for 150 years and had 89 million transactions last year says volume at moneyzap is growing about 10 percent a week whatever the fees industry analysts say the cost of internet payment services is a fraction of that of old fashioned bank money transfers which run from 10 to 25 it 's really leveraging the power of what the internet does best communicating and sending information mr jamieson said in this case money is the information while online payment systems are generally viewed as secure mr caruso says that even the captain of the general accounting office softball team has found it safe and easy to use analysts warn that there are some risks they say that a user when paying for such a transaction with a credit card is typically not covered by fraud protections that commonly come with credit card purchases in general they say those rights are waived because the transaction is viewed as sending cash to someone it 's really like transferring cash around the internet mr jamieson said know that individual you are doing business with know you may not have any recourse if you transfer funds to them james van dyke a senior analyst at jupiter media metrix an internet research firm said the old system of sending money was not foolproof either in the old world you were required to send a check he said somebody had to trust somebody avivah litan vice president for payment services at the gartner group a technology consulting firm said she saw a bright future for the online payment services especially if they were combined with wireless technology allowing consumers to make purchases and payments with their cell phones for example my prediction is that these companies that are going to offer these new applications wo n't want to use traditional banking payments she said it 's a model that is n't going to go away
 timing is everything this is true for most sports in which the aim is to be the first to reach the finish line it is particularly true for motor sports where the difference between first place and also ran can be measured in thousandths of a second in the fia formula one world championship a racing series that constantly seeks to push the frontiers of technology no simple timing method will do the system developed over the last decade by the swiss watch company tag heuer includes transponders on every car and racks of computers to provide precise timing data instantaneously to teams race officials and broadcasters it fills 26 trucks as it moves from race to race during the formula one season and three cargo 747 's when it goes overseas to a race like the united states grand prix which takes place this weekend in indianapolis race timekeeping was not always this complicated when the international automobile federation known as fia its initials in french started the modern formula one world championship in 1950 timing was essentially a stopwatch and notepad affair with each team responsible for tracking its own cars a crew member simply stood at the side of the track and recorded the lap and time whenever the car crossed the finish line one early improvement was the timing board which made the crew member 's job a little easier it used three stopwatches one for the previous lap time one tracking the current lap and one reset to zero in preparation for the next it was not until the 1960 's however that a system was developed that allowed one person to time all the cars in a race by simply pressing a button as each one crossed the finish line a team of people was still required however to keep track of the cars a screamer to call out the sequence as the cars crossed the line a writer to record the car numbers and a group of human calculators these were pre pc days who determined average speeds and other race statistics the problem with all of these approaches was that they relied on people if you do the timekeeping manually you have different sources of errors said jean campiche tag heuer 's official timekeeper for formula one the timer could push the button late the cars could be incorrectly identified or a mistake could crop up in the calculations by the 1980 's developments in automated timing eliminated some of the sources of error each car was equipped with a transponder that transmitted a unique signal used to identify the car as it crossed the finish line photocells were used to stop the clock at the exact moment when the cars crossed the finish line by then computers were available for calculations it was less than perfect photocells can not differentiate between two or three cars together and human intervention was often still needed now however people largely stay out of the picture at least while the race is on when tag heuer was named official timer for formula one in 1992 the company concentrated on developing transponder technology the system in use since 1996 is integrated with the track and the data is processed at a timing center accuracy is down to a thousandth of a second transponders mounted low in the chassis near the front suspension are now used to register times as well as identify the cars signals are received by antennas around the track and transmitted to the timing center by fiber optic cable times and speed are measured at the finish line and at two intermediate locations on the track top speed is measured at a fourth location close to the end of the longest straight where the cars are at their fastest antennas are also installed at the pit lane entrance and exit and along the entire stretch dividing it into a series of speed traps if a driver violates the pit lane speed limit of 50 miles per hour at any point a penalty is given previously radar was used but all the drivers knew where it was located and would speed through the pit lane and brake hard just before that point to avoid being caught small cylindrical sensors placed at the starting grid positions used for the first time in 1996 detect changes in the transponder signal at the start if a car moves before the official start race stewards have irrefutable evidence previously stewards had to rely on eyesight to determine false starts the same type of sensor is also used to time pit stops instead of just showing up for race weekend friday to sunday stopwatch and pen in hand the timekeeping staff arrive a week before the race on monday the timing center is assembled sensors installed and the entire system connected by about 25 miles of fiber optic cable wednesday the connections are tested by thursday at 2 pm the pace car transponder is installed and tested the system is expected to work flawlessly for two practice sessions on friday three sessions including the all important qualifying on saturday and a warm up session and race on sunday immediately after the race the crew begins dismantling and packing up in one week they will begin setting up for the next race

 predicting the future of business for the new year may be like peering into a crystal ball trying to discern images amid a cloudy background but certainly there are some important competitors and trends in the information technology and media industries that will emerge from the haze in 2003 at the end of last year when business day looked for issues and people to watch in 2002 hewlett packard was still trying to acquire compaq computer as it turned out the hewlett deal went through though the chief executive of compaq michael d capellas later left the combined company in the media realm the television networks bet on nostalgia to draw viewers and fans of the harry potter books waited eagerly for the next installment they 're still waiting in the coming year the big story in technology is likely to be cellphones from the use of new standards in europe to the introduction of shiny new handsets to the growing trend of downloading pictures music games and text in the area of personal computing aol and other big internet service providers will be betting on broadband and on handing out discounts to help lure customers makers of communications network equipment like lucent technologies and nortel networks will need accelerating growth in expanding markets like china media companies could face a tumultuous year as the federal communications commission introduces proposals to unshackle the largest broadcasters and telecommunications conglomerates from restraints that have limited growth television networks like cnn will try to prepare for a war against iraq and capitalize on it and record companies will continue to battle for market share as emi which has the lowest share of the five major record companies in the united states tries to build a catalog of artists to stand the test of time at viacom the question is whether mel karmazin the company 's president will remain there on pages c3 and c6 is a look ahead at some of the interesting people and ideas for the new year
 can two losers from the windows world marry and find happiness or at least better sales in the linux world it may seem like a long shot but that is the bet the corel corporation appears to have made in announcing last week that it will merge with the inprise borland corporation corel 's primary product is wordperfect office a suite of productivity applications including word processing spreadsheet and database that runs a very distant second in the market to microsoft office corel actually acquired most of the parts of its suite from novell inc which had bought some of them from borland before borland withdrew from the windows application market to concentrate on software development tools under the inprise name though there remains a loyal core of wordperfect users primarily in law offices and corporations and though many programmers still use borland products to create new software neither corel nor inprise has managed to achieve profitable growth for some time but last year 's introduction of corel linux added a bit of luster to the company 's image and a few points to its share price allowing it to use those shares for its planned acquisition of inprise in a stock swap valued at 107 billion or about 1494 a share shares of corel which is based in ottawa closed on friday at 1750 in nasdaq trading after dropping as low as 2 the last 52 weeks inprise based in scotts valley calif closed at 115625 when it was known as borland the company once traded in the mid 80 's linux is the popular free variant of the unix operating system developed by the finnish programmer linus torvalds widely praised as a lower cost and more reliable alternative to microsoft 's windows nt linux has made surprising gains in the market for the powerful computers that are used as network servers it has been particularly successful among owners of web servers based on the intel corporation 's pentium chips and although it is available free a couple of dozen companies have sprung up to sell enhanced versions of linux packaged with other software and services but corel linux differs from the products offered by companies like red hat or va linux systems in that corel 's linux is aimed not at servers but at desktop computers a market in which microsoft holds a monopoly with windows 95 and 98 indeed corel recommends that users who need an operating system for their network servers install red hat 's product though a server version of corel linux is in the works corel has also released a linux version of its wordperfect word processor and it is promising a suite of desktop linux applications by april this is a market that is wide open the only existing productivity suite for linux is star office a set of applications distributed free by sun microsystems that has not gained wide corporate acceptance sun has not indicated a timetable for releasing improved versions of the suite and at least for the foreseeable future microsoft is not expected to develop a linux version of its industry leading office suite because that could help legitimize linux and discourage wider adoption of windows 2000 the logic behind corel 's acquiring inprise is straightforward inprise gives corel a full range of software products including programming languages and software development tools an operating system and desktop applications the only other company that can claim all three categories is microsoft and though the combined 1999 sales of corel and inprise 418 million are dwarfed by microsoft the combination of corel and inprise is larger than any linux company with inprise borland 's leadership in the software development community and corel 's linux desktop operating system and productivity applications we have an extraordinary opportunity to reach all facets of the exploding linux market said michael c cowpland corel 's president this merger enables us to offer end to end product solutions and global support to all of our shared customers but analysts question the size of the opportunity linux has had phenomenal growth but from a tiny base and total 1999 linux sales for all companies came to just 63 million a tiny fraction of total operating system sales according to the international data corporation virtually all of that was at the server level and it is not clear whether there is any compelling reason to run linux on the desktop no major manufacturer offers intel based desktop machines without windows already installed and the purported advantages of linux like freedom from crashes are less critical on desktops there 's not exactly an immense market for linux desktop applications said jeffrey tarter editor of softletter an industry newsletter no 2 has to find places where no 1 is vulnerable and certainly microsoft is never going to develop credible applications for linux this is a place where corel can go and not have competition from microsoft he added whatever size that market is i 'm sure corel is going to get most of it the interesting question is whether corel can make any money on these fringe markets another issue is whether corel can maintain credibility among proponents of open source the development strategy by which the source code of a program is made freely available to the public enabling any programmer to offer enhancements or fixes linux was developed under this philosophy by unpaid programmers around the world corel antagonized open source proponents last year when it required the signing of nondisclosure agreements to view the beta versions of corel linux corel said it did not want unfinished code to hurt its reputation or to be copied and distributed by others and it later amended the text of the agreement but corel can not really afford to commit fully to the open source philosophy because almost all its current revenue derives from the products it makes for windows users most of the business almost in its entirety comes from windows said maureen o'gara editor of client server news a trade publication they 've got to keep the windows people calm while they go off and build this new empire and she said that although corel is dwarfed by microsoft it has also been a bit of a comeback kid in the windows world it was n't all that long ago it was trading at a dollar she said
 in a way josh pais was always looking for rino thunder in the early 1970 's when mr pais was a child rino thunder was well known in alphabet city for his penetrating eyes and waves of silvery hair some said he was trying to be an actor mr pais who lived with his artist mother lila in a ground floor apartment on east seventh street between avenues c and d usually knew where to find mr thunder a lanky american indian he would be walking his mangy dogs around the block or telling jokes in his rooftop apartment across the street for a time mr thunder and lila pais were lovers the boy already had a father in abraham pais a quiet physicist who lived on the upper east side and had once worked with albert einstein but whenever life on seventh street got dangerous as it often did in those days josh pais felt that rino thunder would protect him so would manny schwartzberg a grizzled foot soldier in the jewish mafia who lived a few doors down so would mickey the block 's con man and merlin the block 's hippie sage mr pais cherished the block he shared with these characters and it is their stories that fill his new documentary 7th street which opened friday at cinema village the film examines mr pais 's own past while chronicling the history of the block from salt marsh to bohemian outpost to crack den to real estate gem i could 've shot the whole east village because it was and is my neighborhood mr pais said after a critic 's screening of the film the other day but seventh street is precious to me the 72 minute film revolves around mr pais 's story so he brushes lightly over the block 's early history with voiceovers and vintage photographs but to document the block of his lifetime he relies on oral history weaving a jumpy succession of street interviews with news clippings and grainy color views of the former ghetto latin and tribal music wafts in and out mr pais a 38 year old actor who resembles ben stiller makes an earnest narrator with his new film mr pais joins a long list of new york filmmakers with a fondness for one classic city spot or another martin scorsese has his vicious five points woody allen his rose colored carnegie hill nora ephron her combative upper west side but mr pais confesses a dedication to seventh street between avenues c and d that borders on obsession he spent 10 years filming the block which today is lined with prim row houses some old some new along with wrought iron railings and spindly trees when he began filming in 1992 he knew that outsiders saw the street only as an anonymous stretch between tompkins square and the jacob riis houses a low income project he knew that local residents often claimed the jazz musician charlie parker as the block 's only past superstar resident and that parker had actually lived around the corner on avenue b even so mr pais could not escape the feeling that his ever changing block merited remembrance territories tend to be small and fluid in this city and he worried that some day he 'd look around for mr thunder and the rest and find strangers there was just some need in me to go out and film them he said to hang onto them before they all vanished when mr pais and his mother moved to seventh street in 1967 josh was 3 and the block seemed unlikely to evoke nostalgia arsonists plagued its boarded up buildings and its cars police officers were a rare sight east of second avenue two years earlier a riot had broken out on the block and several residents had been injured racial tensions bubbled as hungarian jews were replaced by blacks and puerto ricans into this mix came counterculture thinkers artists draft dodgers and musicians many of whom found refuge in the pais home mr pais spent weekends uptown with his father where he wore a jacket to dinner and listened to nobel laureates pontificate but he was shy and preferred seventh street where he could play stickball with a childhood friend named angel or listen to the philosophical ramblings of merlin a bearded hippie who used to sit on the sidewalk later mr pais befriended mickey and john two bit con men who hung out in front of a hungarian hangout called vasac hall he always asked to tag along whenever rino thunder or manny schwartzberg who had moved to seventh street in 1945 left the block to run errands growing up mr pais said i started to realize i was surrounded by people who were passionately alive seventh street felt raw but i found it incredibly theatrical mr pais did n't learn about the riot on the block however until long after he had graduated from dalton where he went at his father 's insistence and attended acting classes in london he moved briefly to hollywood and played the part of raphael in the 1990 movie teenage mutant ninja turtles fourteen movies later that role is still his largest though he may be familiar to law and order fans as borak an assistant medical examiner in 1992 having married the actress lisa emery and moved back to seventh street where he lives today mr pais decided to buy an 800 hi 8 video camera and trail a few of his favorite local characters rino thunder who had just played the kooky role of owatonna in the 1991 spoof hot shots liked the idea so did mr pais 's father josh pais never intended to film for more than a few years but even as the stacks of videotapes piled up in his apartment he felt that he needed more footage crack had ravaged his block but there were flickering signs of recovery perhaps even gentrification he filmed in spurts between acting jobs until 1995 when a local drug lord threatened to harm mr pais 's wife and young son if the camera work continued it stopped three years later police arrested the drug lord and mr pais bought a digital camera he filmed and filmed knowing that his original cast of characters was already dwindling last spring he sent a final cut to cinema village a small theater on east 12th street which agreed to show it the documentary also won a spot in the american film institute festival in los angeles after last week 's screening he wandered from the theater over to tompkins square and his block today many of its buildings are adorned with scaffolding or new coats of paint the block echoes with hammers and renovation crime is lower and rents are much higher at the park mr pais stopped looked around and seeing no one familiar shuffled on in many ways his love letter to his childhood has become a eulogy manny merlin mickey ray his parents all have since died and what of rino thunder he was evicted from his apartment a few years back mr pais said and his dogs died mr pais found him a place at a brooklyn nursing home but mr thunder did not stay there for long he felt too confined mr pais said too far removed from seventh street since then the now shriveled mr thunder has split his time between tompkins park and city shelters he is such a role model to me and it 's hard mr pais said i keep trying to find him a new place but he wo n't go 'this is home he tells me and i ca n't change that

 this fireplace heats the whole house slim aarons said pointing to the ravenous fire warming his book lined living room on a frigid afternoon earlier this month mr aarons 85 the photographer whose images of the beau monde at leisure appeared in town country and life magazine for nearly half a century was extolling the design of his 1782 clapboard farmhouse where he has lived since 1953 the farmers were so smart he said referring to the original owners they planted black walnut trees in front because their leaves were the first to shed in the fall so the house gets the warm winter sunlight when it needs it for mr aarons adroit planning is crucial i 'm a great believer in form and design he said that guiding principle is apparent in his kitchen where a drawer next to the oven is impeccably organized with every conceivable implement for baking similarly the stairway to the cellar is lined with virtually every household necessity including various types of glue all tacked to the wall that organizational zeal is also evident in mr aarons 's photos of swells once he dragged away a giant freezer blocking a 15th century mural that made a splendid setting for a portrait of a roman princess frank zachary the former editor of town country and mr aarons 's former boss called him the photo laureate of the upper classes after a stint as an army photographer mr aarons was sent around the world by diana vreeland the fashion editor of harper 's bazaar once upon a time is a somewhat tardy follow up to mr aarons 's first book a wonderful time harper row 1974 which is similarly filled with pictures of beautiful wealthy famous people having fun today it is a cult object yesterday jane stubbs the rare book dealer had two vintage copies for 1325 each in her store at bergdorf goodman it 's selling for 2000 on ebay mr aarons declared proudly more than once i 'm just trying to figure out why they 're buying it he added with more than a whiff of false modesty i 'm just an ordinary guy mr aarons said i just picked a niche nobody else did luckily it was a world that everyone wanted to read about the society beauties mr aarons photographed were gossip column celebrities of their day every woman in america wanted to be babe paley c z guest or gloria guinness he said those glory days have passed and mr aarons has bid adieu to the city he said he now preferred living in the country and rarely ventured into manhattan only an hour away i do n't go to new york anymore he said i went when it was great and beautiful he was referring in part to the 1950 's when he paid 32 a month for a one bedroom apartment with a terrace on 57th street near park avenue mr aarons 's society portraits include the now familiar image of mrs guest blond and icily beautiful as she holds the arm of her 5 year old son alexander they are standing at her mother in law 's palm beach estate where a fanciful temple to the goddess diana stands sentinel between pool and ocean that image adorns the cover of mr aarons 's new book once upon a time to be published next month by abrams which has become an inadvertent memorial to mrs guest who died on nov 8 in katonah mr aarons who claims to abhor personal publicity was ready to roll an interview with him is not for the fainthearted nor the hungry i arrived for lunch at 12 30 and there was no sign nor mention of food until 4 30 when a lunch of locally smoked salmon was served at last mr aarons likes to talk after a marathon six hour soliloquy during which he scarcely stopped for a breath i was a nervous wreck but mr aarons was just getting started do n't you want to see the rest of the house he asked wearing a light blue shirt open to reveal an old fashioned blue and white polka dot ascot and chinos long enough to accommodate his prodigiously long legs he is 6 feet 4 inches mr aarons led me upstairs to his workroom there surrounded by old fashioned projectors were boxes of negatives labeled arizona millionaires hugh hefner chicago playboy club and bahamas and s america images that might end up in another volume of photographs in the living room where a pair of gleaming english hunting horns stood ready to be sounded mr aarons showed off his books i have every single thing mark twain ever wrote he said no fancy words he added admiringly every trip i traveled i always carried mark twain with me the greatest read in the world i read 'tom sawyer every year the house contains an eccentric assemblage of trophies and memorabilia in a dark hallway mr aarons pointed a flashlight at a wooden weather vane desmond guinness gave me this he said referring to the scion of the irish brewery fortune it used to hang on his door at college the inscription in bold letters said it 's a lovely day for guinness another tour revealed a mural depicting mr aarons farmhouse and the countryside around it i got tired of putting up wallpaper he said mr aarons said he liked living in katonah near bedford all the movie stars have moved in he said chuckling ralph lauren lives just across the lake from here bob pittman lives right here on the corner and the grandson of commodore vanderbilt lives just over there he said pointing to a nearby field last weekend mr aarons attended the funeral of c z guest an event that inspired many of the congregants to remark afterward that her passing signaled the end of an era of grace and style embodying that nearly extinct era mr aarons was something of a star at the luncheon that followed at templeton the guest estate in old westbury on long island everywhere he turned mr aarons was in demand john olsen a senior marketing executive at tommy hilfiger came up to pay homage we have copies of your first book around the office and we refer to it all the time he said no matter your background or your walk of life or circumstance he continued mr aarons 's pictures evoked a simpler time when everyone looked very happy and obviously very rich too he added mr aarons had spent two hours standing on his feet reminiscing about mrs guest suddenly he looked dizzy and on the verge of losing his balance he accepted an offer to accompany him to his car where a driver awaited him in the doorway he fainted and collapsed in my arms when the cry went out for a seat for mr aarons jane holzer the former warhol superstar obliged by fetching a leopard skin armchair i 'm 85 he declared ca n't stand up that long after regaining his composure mr aarons climbed into a waiting car for a good snooze he was driven home and two days later he was eager to talk some more about his book

 when hassan hakmoun played new york last month he needed two gigs one for the traditional music of his homeland morocco and one for all the ideas he has about expanding that tradition since he arrived in the united states 15 years ago he has electrified it joined it with rock and funk bent it toward arabic and indian pop and cooled it down with reggae when i search my brain for music he said i find the rhythm and beats to play other styles of music in my traditional background it 's like my soul if it 's gone i 'm gone mr hakmoun is a master of gnawa music a style of moroccan devotional music performed in all night healing trance ceremonies rooted in west africa it was carried north to morocco via the slave trade centuries ago gnawa music is played on a sintir a long necked three stringed lute and accompanied by castanets it combines call and response african chant wailing arabic melodic lines and a rattling syncopation that is akin to flamenco born in marrakesh to a father who was in the moroccan army and a mother who was a gnawan healer mr hakmoun absorbed the traditional music as a child and by his early teens was playing in jemaa el fna the times square of marrakesh he came to america in 1987 at age 23 for a concert at lincoln center and quickly made a name for himself as a rising force in world music he formed a gnawa rock fusion band zahar signed to peter gabriel 's real world label and began a remarkable series of collaborations with western musicians like the kronos quartet and don cherry using gnawa 's simplicity and vaguely bluesy african roots to meld with rock and jazz what sets hassan apart from most other moroccan musicians is his willingness to come to the western and arab musicians and try to adapt his playing to them said philip schuyler a professor of ethnomusicology at the university of washington whose area of expertise is north africa and the middle east with people like randy weston and pharoah sanders the gnawa are just being used as a kind of base on which other musicians can do their thing now 38 mr hakmoun has just released his first album in nine years the gift triloka which stretches the moroccan sound further than anything he had done before incorporating arabic music and even sugary american pop the first song on the album syada ana is a sprightly funky hymn to a saint that is based on a traditional melody but played with electric guitar and a bouncy bass line similar to the trance funk he first attempted a decade ago with zahar but lighter in june mr hakmoun married paula cole the american pop singer whom he met while on tour with mr gabriel in 1994 the couple set up a studio at their home in bel air calif and recorded a straight pop duet this gift with top dollar los angeles studio musicians it 's a sweet song with this gift i 'll keep surviving they sing in harmony about love or music but without much connection to moroccan music it 's the least effective track on the album this gift is not the only crossover pop track on the album there 's also layla layla a saudi hit from the 70 's that aims to strike a nostalgic chord with fans of arabic pop it 's played with big swells of arabic strings and punctuated by electronic zaps and mr hakmoun sings it like a true vamp other tracks like lala aisha and hamu achieve a spellbinding fusion of moroccan and arabic sounds as mr hakmoun 's sintir duels with arabic violins and clanging moroccan castanets push the mix into passionate crescendos crossover can be a dirty word but not for mr hakmoun the big idea is to get people to listen to us he said in a recent interview at a quiet moroccan restaurant in the west village quiet because the restaurant 's owner an old friend of mr hakmoun 's from morocco closed the place down for lunch i use keyboards drums guitar to introduce people to what we do with traditional instruments and pop is nothing new for him stevie wonder miles davis bob marley these are the kind of people that i listened to in morocco he said the european musicians that i listened to were the police the beatles pink floyd led zeppelin michael jackson he says was my hero he was only four or five years older than me and i saw the opportunities he had with his family mr hakmoun added i grew up with the same kind of family in morocco and that showed me that there is opportunity in america as an artist another of mr hakmoun 's current projects makes an even more ambitious cultural connection on a trip to brazil in the spring of 2000 he found himself jamming with some of the players from olodum the famous samba group from salvador da bahia once they began playing all the musicians were struck by the rhythmic similarities between samba and moroccan music they were freaking out when they heard gnawa music he said of the brazilians and to me the brazilian style sounds like african music it was like uniting a family with music he gathered some moroccan musicians and recorded a number of songs with olodum in two sessions in salvador and sao paulo he plans to do some electronic tweaking on the tapes and release an album in 2004 next on the agenda is a trip to west africa to explore the source of gnawa music i know that 's where my roots came from originally he said in mali and senegal and all over west africa they play the same kind of music i play it 's like searching for a lost family i want to find my origin
 the pell mell advances of rebel forces in afghanistan have so outpaced expectations that american commanders are considering a new war plan that would scale back bombing raids and intensify counterguerrilla operations senior officials said today the new plan would include a greater concentration on gathering intelligence and hunting leaders of the taliban and al qaeda in diminishing pockets of resistance the officials said it could also make use of coalition troops either americans or others to secure key points wrested from the taliban the officials said though the pentagon 's preference is have those tasks done by local anti taliban forces the commander of american forces in afghanistan gen tommy r franks is expected to arrive in washington on thursday to brief secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld on the details the immediate effect of the evolution of the pentagon 's campaign could well be an easing of american strikes in afghanistan that coincides with the beginning of the muslim holy month of ramadan which it to begin friday night you 're going to see a lot more flying but a lot less dropping of bombs and missiles a senior officer said another senior pentagon official said there would be no declaration of the reduction in the air campaign and certainly no formal suspension of the attacks as some leaders in the region had sought in view of the imminence of ramadan american warplanes will still hunt for targets with the goal of denying the taliban and al qaeda any opportunity to regroup after their retreat from cities they held earlier this week but the gunners would pull their triggers more selectively success has a way of reducing your target set one officer said the proposal includes several new elements and is a significant reshaping of the campaign general franks who has led the troops from his headquarters at macdill air force base in tampa is also drafting plans to deploy allied forces including americans to conduct a broader spectrum of operations from striking at the taliban and al qaeda in mountain redoubts to securing routes for food and medical convoys to seizing airfields pentagon officials said they were receiving more detailed intelligence on the movements of mullah muhammad omar the taliban 's leader as the swath of territory in which he can safely operate has shrunk they added that several strikes had been ordered in recent days on buildings and vehicles thought to contain taliban leaders or members of al qaeda an attack was ordered on kabul tuesday after the united states received compelling evidence of al qaeda personnel inside a defense department official said today officials presume that all those inside were killed but the official dismissed reports that osama bin laden had been spotted during the recent days of confusion as commander of the united states central command overseeing forces from the indian ocean to the red sea general franks is contemplating the formation of special task forces to deal with missions like aid counterterrorism and reconnaissance officials said central command planners are also deciding how to assign troops from other countries working through a military office in qatar even as the rebels advance and the taliban appear to have collapsed the pentagon continues to build up its forces and senior officials continue to assert that their mission is far from over a senior officer said today that secretary rumsfeld had ordered three more ac 130 special forces gunships which bring a withering rapid fire high caliber attack to ground forces for a total of nine almost half the air force 's fleet general franks is also reviewing growing offers of troops from other nations pentagon officials said he is working on new arrangements for providing relief on a grand scale including the use of nato airlifts and the need to put troops at airports to protect the planes as supplies are flown in officials said turkey is willing to play a role similar to australia 's in east timor leading an international force to secure kabul but has not been asked yet the pentagon 's first choice for securing relief routes is the northern alliance itself the second choice is coalition members especially from islamic states american troops are a final option the officials said finally general franks is reviewing plans for concentrating his forces in the air and on the ground in the narrowing sections of the country where the conflict is still hot and where mr bin laden and the top taliban leaders are thought to be hiding this has moved so fast we have to step back and review where we go next one defense department official said another senior pentagon official said given the developments it 's time to take stock the narrowing of taliban operations presents opportunities and difficulties the united states can now focus both its surveillance and its direct action on smaller portions of afghanistan at the same time the job of identifying taliban and al qaeda targets as separate from northern alliance troops soldiers loyal to a southern pashtun tribes and even afghan civilians has become increasingly difficult given the turmoil in the region in the south dispersing taliban fighters are moving in small units and are mixed up with emerging resistance forces once again fighter jets operating from two american carriers in the arabian sea were reported to be returning with most of their bombs still fixed beneath their wings pentagon officials also said that as the taliban 's fortunes appear to wane rapidly offers of rewards for information might be more likely to be accepted officially the pentagon cautioned against an early declaration of success saying it could be days before it is clear whether the taliban and al qaeda are on the run or simply in tactical retreat to more defensible positions at a pentagon briefing today rear adm john stufflebeem deputy director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff said the united states is prepared if conditions dictate to shift to a counterguerrilla strategy in this he suggested the anti taliban forces might well take part we should also presume that northern alliance opposition groups or for that matter all opposition groups are familiar with this kind of guerrilla warfare he said especially since it happens in a country that they are experienced in

italy q are there ryanair type low price airlines in italy particularly flying between venice and palermo charles f brydon seattle a there are roughly 20 airlines operating in italy but no true discount carrier along the lines of the irish airline ryanair according to journalists reporting on the aviation industry and the airlines themselves only one airline flies nonstop between venice and palermo alpi eagles which operates mainly in the north of the country with a few destinations elsewhere in europe it has 19 flights a week between those cities with the round trip fares including taxes running from 233 to 390 at 105 euros to the dollar but if you do n't mind a stop in rome flying alitalia will probably be cheaper with round trip fares starting at 172 for alpi eagle reservations call 39 41 599 7788 or go to wwwalpieaglescom for alitalia in the united states call 800 223 5730 or go to wwwalitaliausacom a widely held belief is that italy has not developed discount carriers because the domestic market mostly serves business travelers experts say they are willing to pay higher fares to fly into more convenient airports for better meals on good china for home delivery of tickets and other amenities the popularity of luxury business travel has led to the success of for example air dolomiti 39 04 5860 5211 and www airdolomitiit en indexasp which serves northern cities primarily and offers such pampering alitalia 's only major competitor in the italian market is airone 39 06 488 800 and wwwair oneit which offers better fares than the former state owned airline on some routes milan venice for example one way tickets can be 70 percent cheaper than on alitalia but the savings on round trip fares is usually far less perhaps 40 or 50 so booking two

 at bottom president bush 's speech on tuesday reflects the belief that the current corporate scandals are merely the handiwork of a few bad apples if we enforce existing laws more strongly he essentially told us the mess will be cleaned up he called for longer prison sentences and a federal swat team to combat fraud is such law enforcement talk what he thinks americans understand any new rules or regulations will be left to self regulators like stock exchanges there is no need for direct government oversight of accounting but something more systemic than a few clever swindlers is staining america it is hard to believe that mr bush 's economic advisers do n't know that the enron deceptions alone involved some of the nation 's most prestigious accountants lawyers wall street brokers and commercial bankers along with some of enron 's own highly respected directors about 1000 corporations have had to restate earnings the last five years a good economist 's first instinct would be to determine whether there are incentives built into the financial system that encourage deception and fraud a president who wanted to make business trustworthy again and renew the nation 's confidence would address these incentives directly it 's helpful to return for perspective to the corporate scandals of the 1980 's and 1990 's the best piece of economic analysis on the subject was done by george a akerlof of the university of california at berkeley later a nobel prize winner and paul m romer now of the stanford business school in the brookings papers on economic activity the two developed a model that showed fairly convincingly that it was rational for executives to loot their companies when accounting standards were lax their most compelling examples were the savings and loan bankruptcies of the 1980 's accounting rules were changed and existing standards relaxed to aid the s l 's after high interest rates devastated them in the late 1970 's but permissive accounting coupled with federal guarantees of deposits ultimately enabled executives to make highly risky investments to inflate short term profits they could pay themselves enormous compensation because the accounting methods did not properly reflect the risks or costs until years later the incentives encouraged them to make investments that mr akerlof and mr romer wrote could have had no reasonable payoff in any future state of the world this is sadly familiar enron inflated profits through highly devious accounting it made many bad investments whose long run risks could be hidden but that could produce rapid if temporary profits worldcom and other telecommunications companies made similarly risky investments building capacity aggressively even when there was no sign of demand but the executives were still able to enrich themselves the widespread granting of stock options created similar incentives with damaging consequences the prevailing worry famously raised by adolf berle and gardiner means in the 1930 's had been that managers would run companies to preserve their jobs rather than to maximize profits now the problem had purportedly been solved options allowed them to buy large quantities of their companies shares at low prices managers who received options it was argued would act entrepreneurially because they would be compensated as owners would be but options it turned out encouraged managers to take unduly big risks as long as they showed handsome short term profits they became rich if investments paid off but they did not lose money if they failed and they could usually bail out long before the investments went bad they also managed earnings to appeal to wall street 's short term orientation nothing was quite so ludicrous as when investors clobbered a stock because earnings per share were a penny or two below expectations now we know that billions of dollars of profits were simply fabricated true reform must correct such distorting incentives and if we are honest it should involve new regulation the stakes are high it is not just a matter of a few executives stealing a hundred million here or there perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars of national savings were misallocated to businesses that did not last rather than invested in businesses that might have created long term profits and permanent jobs the holdings of pension funds endowments and individuals have collapsed here is a start first every effort must be made to make sure accounting rules are tough and are adhered to industry on its own has not been up to this task accounting rules have been consistently watered down the last 10 years government should be involved in setting the rules a bill working through the senate sponsored by paul s sarbanes democrat of maryland is worth consideration second the ultimate authority over the annual audit of accounting practices should be held by special committees of corporate boards completely separate from chief executives and their staff third options should be deducted from current earnings so shareholders know what they are paying now there is no required deduction mr bush has said nothing about expensing options but even the federal reserve chairman alan greenspan supports such a reform more jail time for fraud as the president recommends may help but it will hardly be enough finding executives guilty swat team or not will continue to be difficult enron and worldcom executives will cite in their defense the opinions of accountants and lawyers who assured them usually in writing that what they were doing was not deceptive or illegal mr bush apparently can not or will not see that these deceptive and greedy executives operated in an environment that not merely tolerated their actions but encouraged them it is not just the bad apples that need to be expunged distorting incentives must be changed until that is acknowledged confidence will not be restored economic scene jeff madrick who

 liane le tendre does not work for google the operator of the web 's most popular search engine but she depends on google for her income the google search engine directs more than 3000 people a day to ms le tendre 's web site bareboatsbvicom for her brokerage service for yacht charters in the british virgin islands her four year old company has always relied on web visitors but the traffic used to come from a wide range of search sites now the visitors who arrive from google generate about 85 percent of her business providing her with a comfortable living and because her site shows up prominently in the search engine 's free listings for queries like british virgin islands yacht she has never had to pay google a penny ms le tendre says she assumes that there are many thousands of proprietors like herself who are dependent on google traffic for their incomes i could n't even guess at the amount of sales generated by google she said but i would imagine it would be sufficient to run a good sized country think of it as the google economy much as ebay spawned an army of entrepreneurial auctioneers google has become enough of a web gatekeeper that its leads now prop up plenty of commercial sites companies can pay google to promote their sites although the paid listings are labeled as such and are listed separately from the unpaid results but many smaller merchants in specialized niches like ms le tendre 's rely on their sites turning up in google 's free search results google uses many variables in its automated ranking process but a key one is the number of other pages linking to a particular page because links can serve as a kind of endorsement google regularly shuffles its rankings to reflect changes in its own methods or in the web 's link structure and content that makes its free listings a risky platform on which to build a business google also routinely slashes the rankings of sites that appear to be using tricks like hiding keywords in invisible text that can be read only by search engines but it is hard to discourage those who see good positioning in google 's search results as the path to riches on webmasterworld com and other discussion boards site owners and consultants gather to exchange tips on the black art of what is known as search engine optimization and to analyze google 's every hiccup traffic from search engines is especially important to small sites that unlike those of amazoncom or gap do not have the brand recognition to attract shoppers on their own only about 15 percent of consumers used a search engine to locate their most recent online purchase according to carrie a johnson a senior analyst at forrester research and yet search engine users tend to be more technically savvy she said those are the people who spend the most money online a common complaint on webmaster discussion sites is that google through deals to provide its search results to yahoo america online and other partners controls too large a share of the search market the complaints grew louder in october when yahoo demoted its own directory listings and gave more prominence to google 's results with its partner sites included google is now responsible for about three quarters of all search engine traffic to web sites according to the research firm statmarket because of this power google can be your best friend or your worst enemy said dario ferreira the owner and operator of connecticut weddingscom and similar wedding portals for other states sergey brin one of google 's founders and its president of technology acknowledged that google 's large market share can leave web site owners vulnerable to fluctuations in traffic but he was unapologetic about google 's success and its emphasis on keeping users happy even at the expense of webmasters the only reason people come to google is because it works for them he said sometimes a site 's ranking plunges drastically or disappears from google altogether often this means that google detected some evidence that the site 's owner was using deceptive tactics like building a network of linked sites to create the illusion of popularity and thereby receive a higher ranking but site owners say google can sometimes be overzealous in its fight against manipulation and some say they live in fear that a small mistake or a technical glitch will get them booted from the search results and wipe out their income ms le tendre the yacht broker for example said she was building separate sites for two new branches of her business just in case nancy bernardine a jewelry maker in cincinnati who sells her work online said she did not know for certain why google dropped her site from its index a year and a half ago resulting in a 75 percent drop in her web traffic she did several things that she said she now knows are frowned upon by google like using software that monitors a site 's rankings although she has stopped using the software and has sent e mail messages to google many times she says she has received only generic responses and that her site has made only a partial recovery in search results she says she believes google may still be punishing her somehow i 've groveled i 've apologized i 've acknowledged my sins she said but still nothing google officials declined to comment on specific cases but mr brin said google 's staff was trying to be responsive to queries and complaints from site owners by participating in online forums and answering some portion of the mountains of e mail it receives google also looks for trends in such messages that might warrant changes in the company 's software algorithms he said online merchants can guarantee their appearance on google 's search pages by signing up with google 's advertising programs they can ensure placement on other search sites by using similar services from companies like overture services which supplies paid listings to msn search and others these keyword targeted ads have been popular with advertisers and lucrative for search engines but merchants who have learned how to do well in the free listings through careful use of keywords and site structure say they receive more traffic through the nonpaid methods allan pollett who lives near toronto and runs an online art dealer ucanbuyartcom said paid listings with the search services yahoo and looksmart had failed to bring in much business the same was true of magazine and television ads he said i got more visitors from google than i got from any of those other outlets and i could do it for free he said the free ride may not last however ms johnson of forrester says larger companies have been discovering the power of search engines and site optimization as was the case on ebay when big

 a manhattan judge yesterday postponed the retrial of a columbia university graduate student who was accused of kidnapping and torturing a barnard student he met through the internet after an angry courtroom exchange during which defense lawyers attacked the barnard woman 's credibility at an emergency hearing manhattan prosecutors asked justice william a wetzel of state supreme court to put off the retrial of the graduate student oliver jovanovic until september saying that the 25 year old woman had become increasingly reluctant to testify they said that they had often been unable to reach her and that she had agreed to go forward with the case only last friday we were actually contemplating a dismissal of the case an assistant district attorney lanita hobbs told justice wetzel ms hobbs said that the barnard student had felt humiliated and dispirited by the legal process and the news media attention surrounding the case and was uncertain she wanted to go through another trial the woman ms hobbs explained did not want to relive the incident relive the mockery with defense investigators and members of the press ceaselessly harassing her then ms hobbs continued the woman became unresponsive and unavailable to prosecutors and briefly insisted that she would not testify when the defense tried to obtain records relating to her present boyfriend she has now decided to go forward with the case ms hobbs said jury selection for the second trial was set to begin next wednesday justice wetzel granted the postponement and set a new date of sept 4 in 1998 mr jovanovic was convicted of kidnapping and assaulting the woman in a sadomasochistic encounter after a dinner date and was sentenced to 15 years in prison but the conviction was overturned late in 1999 when an appellate court ruled that justice wetzel who also oversaw the first trial had improperly excluded from the trial the use of e mail correspondence in which the woman and mr jovanovic shared their interest in sadomasochism defense lawyers for mr jovanovic derided the request for a delay and mounted their strongest public attack on what they have long contended is the woman 's lack of credibility as justice wetzel tried to silence him paul f callan mr jovanovic 's lawyer contended that the woman had previously made false accusations of sexual misconduct against her father and uncle as well as a complaint of harassment against the boyfriend of a college roommate he further said that she had lied about her sexual history and he contended that she had engaged in sadomasochism with two different boyfriends at the time she accused mr jovanovic the arguments by mr callan including his plea for dismissing the case altogether provoked a sharp rebuke from justice wetzel get off the soapbox and have a seat justice wetzel said i ask you to sit down and be quiet and get control of your thoughts at one point justice wetzel threatened to hold mr callan in contempt and he directed an armed court officer to stand behind the lawyer the prosecution began in 1996 with allegations that mr jovanovic was a cyber predator one of the first to be charged with committing an internet related sexual assault at mr jovanovic 's arraignment linda fairstein head of the manhattan district attorney 's sex crimes unit made reference to the serial killer ted bundy and asked for 500000 bail but defense lawyers contended that prosecutors were overreaching and that they deliberately overlooked evidence that cast doubt on the woman 's story even members of the woman 's family joined with the jovanovic family in demanding an end to the prosecution asserting that she had a history of dishonesty the appellate court agreed that the full story had not been told and it upbraided justice wetzel for misusing a law that protects rape victims privacy to block their e mail exchange as evidence and denying mr jovanovic a chance to confront his accuser in recent months as the retrial date approached people involved in the case said that prosecutors dangled plea bargains that would end the case and require no more jail time for mr jovanovic who served two years of his sentence before being released mr jovanovic has refused to plead guilty to any wrongdoing in the encounter with the student which he has said was nonviolent and consensual

 the new york state department of health cited coney island hospital yesterday for 23 health violations and ordered it to hire a consultant to improve its emergency room care saying the staff provided insufficient treatment last summer to a woman who said she had been beaten and raped under the boardwalk the department also fined the hospital 46000 and placed it on probation for one year it was the fourth time this year that the state 's health commissioner dr antonia c novello sharply criticized a new york city hospital and issued a large fine the investigation examined the hospital 's treatment of a 31 year old woman who was attacked last july by anthony jones a serial sex offender who had been released the night before from the great meadow correctional facility he placed the woman in a chokehold and dragged her under the boardwalk she told the police that she had been raped and that her life had been threatened until she broke free and ran onto surf avenue the authorities took her to coney island hospital for treatment and a rape exam the new york times reported in may that the hospital had failed to send critical pieces of forensic evidence from the victim 's rape examination including the woman 's underwear and swabs from her genital area to the city medical examiner 's office where officials try to isolate attackers dna in rape cases without the evidence prosecutors had to withdraw their rape charge against mr jones who pleaded guilty to attempted assault and was sentenced to two to four years in prison mr jones 42 who has spent much of his adult life in prison for sex attacks in new york and arizona had faced a possible life sentence if convicted of rape the state 's investigation found a series of problems in the victim 's treatment from an exam by a resident that was deemed cursory to a failure to ensure that the victim received adequate screening for sexually transmitted diseases and complete medication to prevent pregnancy although the woman 's case was classified as urgent she was not fully examined for more than three hours the state said in its conclusions which were submitted to the hospital yesterday the mistakes continued until the victim 's last moment at the hospital the state found and included an incomplete evaluation by a social worker who apparently did not offer the victim a homeless prostitute and heroin addict referrals for substance abuse treatment or shelter the state found there were multiple problems that occurred in the care of this individual said wayne m osten director of the state 's office of health system management which investigated the case dr jane d zimmerman spokeswoman for the city 's health and hospitals corporation which supervises coney island hospital and 10 other public hospitals said the investigation had gone too far the hospital 's emergency room she said handled 46000 visits last year including more than 100 rape and sexual assault cases this is the first and only time the contents of a rape kit have been questioned she said this is an extreme overreaction by the state department of health it is overkill of enormous proportion what exactly happened to the missing evidence is still not clear dr zimmerman said the resident who performed the exam told investigators that she had done it completely dr zimmerman also said that the fallout of the case had reverberated through the hospital to the extent that the state hospital review and planning council was holding up the corporation 's effort to get approval on a 105 million renovation dr novello the health commissioner said she was particularly angered about the case because it involved a homeless victim she suggested that medical care and compassion was denied the woman because of her station in life rape victims she said should be treated the same irrespective of whether the victim was homeless or the richest woman in new york state the investigation 's list of deficiencies was unsparing criticizing the hospital from its nursing staff and social workers to its highest level of management the state ordered the hospital to submit a plan within 10 days describing how it would correct each of the 23 violations the state also ordered the hospital to hire an independent consultant to analyze the operation and management of the emergency department and to submit recommendations for improvement within 90 days the hospital has 10 days to decide if it wants to contest the findings dr zimmerman said the corporation had not yet decided how to proceed katherine n lapp the state 's director of criminal justice applauded the state 's findings yesterday we need to send them a message and that 's what the commissioner of health is doing ms lapp said this is sending a message to this hospital and to every hospital in the state that when a woman presents herself as a victim of a sex crime she receives an immediate and thorough check up and a proper rape kit examination she said the sanction was the fourth against a hospital in the city this year in february the health department fined beth israel medical center after an obstetrician carved his initials into a woman 's abdomen in march it fined maimonides medical center for covering up an operation in which a surgeon removed a patient 's healthy kidney also that month it fined staten island hospital for failing to monitor and discipline its chief of neurosurgery who the department said operated on the wrong side of two patients brains dr zimmerman said the mistakes at coney island hospital were not of the same magnitude this particular incident does not even rise to the threshold of a reportable event she said the state is treating this as if it were an egregious medical error which it is not

 mayor rudolph w giuliani sent out a pre holiday warning yesterday to panhandlers squeegee crews prostitutes noisemakers and others who he said disturb the public peace announcing his latest crackdown on quality of life crimes in new york city this time with a high tech spin since he came into office nearly seven years ago mr giuliani has unveiled a series of similar law enforcement initiatives often as the holidays neared and hordes of tourists visited the city what distinguishes this latest campaign according to the giuliani administration is the enlistment of a police department computer mapping system traditionally used to monitor more serious crimes like robbery rape and murder now complaints about everything from loud music to graffiti public drinking prostitution panhandling and homelessness will be pin mapped precinct by precinct and police supervisors will be expected to move quickly and aggressively to counter any trends the mayor and his police commissioner bernard b kerik said this will now be a major area where precinct commanders and people in the precincts are held accountable mr giuliani said and it really has to be done that way because quality of life problems are very different depending on the part of the city you are in yesterday 's city hall news conference which drew a standing room only crowd to the ceremonial blue room represented a return of sorts to the center stage for the mayor this summer and fall have been dominated by the ongoing election drama and baseball the mayor has also had to curtail his activities at least a bit as a result of his continuing prostate cancer treatment but the mayor was in full form yesterday boasting about the city 's much heralded success in cutting crime and his newest plans to push the numbers even lower he made no reference to the ongoing trial of paris drake the 36 year old man charged with randomly attacking a young woman in midtown last november with a six pound paving stone but it was clear that he was trying to reassure the public that crackdowns on the homeless as well as earlier ones related to graffiti loud radios and other nuisance crimes are still under way the city of new york is now world famous for its turnaround its renaissance its reform whatever you want to call it mr giuliani said the core however of the turnaround of new york city has to do with public safety and quality of life i would like to remind people of that within hours of the announcement though some community leaders and civil libertarians were questioning the impact the mayor 's new initiative might have other than to earn some public relations notice most of the nuisance crimes cited by the mayor yesterday have been the focus of special enforcement efforts before they noted they also raised concerns that in the zeal to impose order the administration might compromise individual rights the real issue here is what tactics will the nypd employ and whether these tactics will violate people 's civil liberties as they have done before said norman siegel executive director of the new york civil liberties union other municipalities such as boston and san diego have dramatically reduced crime without this dark side but the mayor defended the city 's policies particularly last year 's initiative to try to remove the homeless from the streets saying that contrary to predictions the police arrested only a small percentage of the homeless they encountered since last november of the 28671 homeless questioned by the police in the last 12 months 6365 were transported to shelters 532 were taken to hospitals and another 1317 or 46 percent of those questioned were arrested on charges including outstanding warrants urinating in public and disruptive behavior with police officers or social workers the mayor said the mayor also took the chance yesterday to offer a few quick civics lessons as a defense of his focus on these quality of life crimes regarding the homeless he said you are not allowed to live on a street in a civilized city it is not good for you it is not good for us he added maybe the city was stupid enough to embrace that idea years ago we care about you enough and are not that dumb to think you should live on streets so we contact and tell you you have got to move the mayor gave little hint of which of the many threats to civil order that he cited would get the most attention but police officials said enforcement efforts would be based in part on complaints collected from the mayor 's quality of life phone line 888 677 life or 888 677 5433 which in the first eight and a half months of this year received 38167 calls with noise complaints by far the most frequent commissioner kerik said that the police would not expand any squads assigned to quality of life crimes or increase spending on overtime instead at weekly meetings of precinct commanders and other department officials progress in combating nuisance crimes will be discussed and officers out on routine patrols will now be expected to pay more attention to them mr kerik said that unless there is a consistent focus on these kinds of complaints enforcement tends to surge and then decline prostitution particularly graffiti panhandling they will disappear for a while then when the focus and direction is off those problematic areas out on the street they start to flourish and pop back up again mr kerik said if we stay on them constantly he added we will be able to keep them to a very minimal level mr giuliani acknowledged that the effort might result in a surge in new citations and arrests which could ultimately increase the burden on the city 's courts but he added that that did not worry him we explained it to the court he said they may have to work a little harder that is good

band before the face of god james o halliwell in his 1847 dictionary of archaic and provincial words reminded us that a band was a space 20 yards square and broad band was corn laid out in the sheaf on the band and spread out to dry after rain over three centuries the band evolved from a marked out strip of land into a range of radio frequencies or wavelengths in 1956 w a heflin 's us air force dictionary defined broadband as a band having a wide range of frequencies in our time it morphed into a medium that not only transmits a wide range of radio video and data signals but also can carry other independent channels in their own bandwidths or space on the band on these multiple spaces the communicators still seem to lay out wet corn then metaphor began to beat the broadband the adjective sometimes hyphenated is still used to describe multiplex communications networks but in more sweeping terms in a broad band world wrote andrew sullivan in the new york times even the distinctions among telephone wires cables and satellites will be erased there will be one cultural economic tube the milwaukee journal sentinal wrote of the broad band war the struggle over who will control the ability to deliver seamless streams of data to consumers and now in an interinactive linguistic breakthrough mr levin has extended the metaphor from networks to human beings i am a

dieter in theology and usage i react religiously the etymology of agnostic is plain it 's greek for not known here 's how it was coined to describe the position held by people who are neither atheists

kissinger in his 1979 memoirs the white house years was among the first to give the word a metaphoric stretch i favored european unity but i was agnostic about the form it should take the intended

 a shimmering blue mercedes benz carries the holy man toward the sickly flock that is awaiting deliverance the faithful believe that he is a prophet a savior a man of miracles who can stop the plague that is killing this poor rural village god has sent the healer the women sing in his ramshackle church where the sunlight glints between the wooden planks in the roof he is the rev solomon mahlangu a former driving instructor who wears french suits leather shoes and an air of prosperity that is as intoxicating as fine cologne he claims that his healing hands have pulled the rains from cloudless skies exorcised wayward spirits and most important cured dozens of people suffering from aids they say it is impossible but to god nothing is impossible mr mahlangu 40 said one day this week as he settled into the church he built last year when i am facing an impossible situation like aids i can feel the power of god coming on me and i know this person will be healed i 've been thinking about advertising what god is doing there are extraordinary things that god is doing here in this community where about 35 percent of adults are believed to be infected with the aids virus he needs no advertisements when thembalihle xulu 29 stood before the congregation last year and announced that mr mahlangu had cured him of aids the news spread like wildfire some called mr mahlangu a swindler for promising miracles for money that has not stopped the sick from flocking to god 's plan church which he created today scores of people give their trust and their pennies to a man who promises to do what the government is still struggling to do help this community cope with its deadly scourge south africa has more people infected with hiv than any other nation and a furious debate is raging here over whether the government should provide the poor with the lifesaving aids medicines commonly prescribed in the west advocates for aids patients say officials have a moral obligation to provide the drugs officials on the other hand question the cost and the safety of the medicines the debate seems meaningless to many in this remote village where goats and barefoot children skitter through the dust and dozens of promising young people are buried before they reach 30 here where clinics run short of even the most basic medicines it is easier to believe in a miracle worker than in the possibility that the government might provide aids drugs with so many people dying and with no solutions in sight many ordinary people are thankful that mr mahlangu has come to town he says he left his job as a driving instructor in johannesburg when god told him to heal the poor he 's bringing miracles he 's saving the community insisted rose zungu 33 her brown eyes luminous with hope god is greater than pills god is greater than the condom mrs zungu 's husband is infected with hiv they can not afford aids drugs and before the pastor moved to town she worried about how to cope now she has an answer she prays at least three times a day she tested negative for hiv last year and aids counselors have begged her to protect herself but she refuses mr mahlangu says prayer is the best protection and mrs zungu a typist agrees there are miracles happening here now said mrs zungu who says her husband has gained weight since he began attending the church that pastor there 's not another like him in the world ellen dube the overworked aids counselor at hlabisa hospital remains unconvinced she contends that the preacher is a charlatan who is using the aids epidemic to get rich she begs her clients to continue to use condoms telling them that god would not have created condoms if he did not want people to use them but some of her clients refuse to listen and some have already died these days mrs dube watches mrs zungu anxiously looking for symptoms she shakes her head with rage and frustration when she considers that this woman who could have protected herself might be needlessly infected hiv positive people who have supported him they are dying now mrs dube said referring to mr mahlangu he says that by praying they are going to survive but they are just dying mr mahlangu acknowledges that some of his parishioners have died but he says it is because they sought advice from traditional healers and ancestors which made god angry those who have remained true to god are living healthy lives he contends at his evening services his followers clap dance and call to the heavens among the poor people here with tattered trousers there are also professionals teachers nurses and businessmen whose faith in modern medicine has been eroded by the aids epidemic he is very powerful said joyce masondo a nurse at hlabisa hospital and member of god 's plan people are coming because he is healing in this church they can see wonders in this church mr mahlangu says the wonders will multiply he has already enlarged his church three times in the past year to accommodate his growing flock he dreams of building a grand auditorium someday in this dusty village he dismisses his critics saying he is offering people infected with hiv something the naysayers can not hope some people say i 'm making money because i 'm driving a mercedes said mr mahlangu who insists that he collects money only during sunday services you get people pointing fingers and saying my powers come from the devil but i keep on going on what matters to me is that the people are still flocking in i 'm making a difference

 gary winnick the billionaire chairman and founder of global crossing may have helped oversee the company 's aggressive use of swapping communications capacity on its fiber optic network with other companies according to documents obtained by a congressional committee these swaps widespread until the financial collapse of global crossing and several of its competitors over the last year may have been instrumental in allowing companies to show robust financial health at a time when their business was actually deteriorating the securities and exchange commission ruled earlier this month that global crossing and other companies often improperly accounted for such deals representatives for mr winnick who made more than 730 million from deals involving global crossing stock before the company filed for bankruptcy protection in january have argued that he knew little about day to day management of the company in his role as chairman the house energy and commerce committee however is shifting the focus of its investigation of business practices at global crossing to the activities of mr winnick after obtaining detailed minutes of board meetings internal company e mail messages and copies of presentations by global crossing executives describing such swaps a spokesman for the panel said global crossing which was bought out of bankruptcy earlier this month by two asian companies also faces separate investigations by the house financial services committee the sec and the justice department the energy and commerce committee which began its investigation of global crossing in february after the company filed for bankruptcy protection may issue a subpoena to mr winnick after his representatives angered its members by trying to establish the terms of an interview by congressional investigators winnick has agreed to tell us about his first grade activities and who he dated in high school but has refused to talk about anything under investigation by the sec said ken johnson an aide for representative billy tauzin republican of louisiana and chairman of the committee this is a problem for us and chairman tauzin is strongly considering issuing a subpoena for winnick gary p naftalis a lawyer representing mr winnick said i 'm not aware of any subpoenas being served yet in addition to mr naftalis an expert on white collar criminal defense at kramer levin naftalis frankel mr winnick is being advised by howard j rubenstein the prominent new york public relations executive according to a copy of minutes of a meeting of the executive committee of global crossing 's board on march 30 2001 mr winnick led a discussion of a deal with another company 360networks that was apparently structured to allow global crossing to meet analysts estimates for the first quarter of last year several executives argued against the swap which was originally valued at 400 million but mr winnick who was chairman of the meeting on the last day of that quarter eventually led a discussion that resulted in its approval according to testimony obtained by the committee a short time after the deal was put into place the entire transaction unraveled after 360networks filed for bankruptcy protection still global crossing was able to meet the expectations of financial analysts when it reported its results for that quarter mr johnson said mr naftalis referred questions about 360networks to ralph ferrara a lawyer for global crossing who did not return phone calls according to mr johnson the committee is also trying to determine whether mr winnick and other executives acted improperly in selling global crossing stock in may 2001 after the 360networks and similar deals were reached mr winnick sold 123 million in stock that month before james c gorton the company 's general counsel closed the window for such transactions in june 2001 because of the company 's fading prospects thomas j casey a former chief executive at global crossing told committee investigators that joseph perrone the executive vice president for finance told him as early as april that the company 's revenues were softening that information has raised concern among investigators whether a subsequent study in mid may of the effect of the telecommunications crisis on global crossing was intended to provide cover for stock sales that month that could not have taken place the next month mr winnick 's stock sale in may was done without any knowledge of facts that would have made it improper mr naftalis said the committee has also obtained e mail messages that appear to suggest high ranking executives at global crossing understood that the practice of swapping communications capacity was intended mainly to allow the company to meet analysts quarterly estimates instead of fundamentally improving business in one message dated may 31 2001 discussing ways to compensate sales representatives for putting together swaps mr casey told mr gorton the general counsel let me make sure i understand your position here if we do n't get these deals we miss our quarters if we do n't incentivize the sales force they wo n't do these deals
 technology developers are being forced to rethink products from photocopiers to software to meet some new requirements from one of their biggest customers the federal government that is because the government is facing some new requirements itself under regulations taking effect today all technology purchased by federal agencies must be accessible to the disabled with few exceptions the provisions will affect a wide range of equipment and services from federal web sites used by the public to office equipment used by government employees while the regulations issued under section 508 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 exempt some sectors like sensitive parts of the military they otherwise extend broadly to agencies as diverse as the social security administration the coast guard and the tennessee valley authority some of the changes that will gradually become apparent are government webcasts captioned for the deaf and photocopiers accessible to employees in wheelchairs the postal service which operates 37000 stamp machines will now buy only vending machines accessible to the blind as today 's deadline approached however many of the policy 's implications and details remained unclear it 's a frenzy right now said amy berger the section 508 coordinator for the united states geological survey who is blind and uses software that reads web pages aloud there 's so much going on people are trying to figure how it 's all going to unfold only six months have passed since the requirements for accessibility were issued and the government is still trying to get the word out to federal employees and technology companies through seminars and an inundation of memorandums some standards have purposely been made general describing goals rather than how to achieve them to allow for the ever changing uses and specifications of technology as a result interpretations may vary among agencies and even within them also items may be exempted if they require a fundamental alteration or there is an undue burden terms that are subject to interpretation don heffernan the acting chief information officer of federal supply service at the general services administration the government 's main purchasing arm acknowledged that confusion had resulted these are not a clean set of guidelines he said trying to educate them all when you 're not quite sure yourself is not an easy task one misinterpretation arose in april when an e mail message was sent by a midlevel employee to the agency 's webmasters warning any web sites that are not section 508 compliant will go dark john sindelar deputy associate administrator of the office of governmentwide policy at the general services administration said that existing web sites were actually not subject to the regulations taking effect today but that the sites were being updated as part of a federal policy of accommodating the disabled with agencies using the section 508 standards as guidelines we were giving them the incentive to get hustling and get them done he said under the new standards web pages will be fully readable by the software that translates words into sounds for the blind meaning all images must have text equivalents at present web pages without such text tags can present hurdles for people like ms berger who tried to use the web to sign up for a training course about section 508 i went out to register she said and there was an instruction to click on the blue triangle it was a joke also under the new standards wheelchair users like craig luigart the chief information officer at the department of education will find it easier to use equipment like photocopiers it can be a pain said mr luigart who has a rare neuromuscular disorder called primary lateral sclerosis when the control deck is horizontal to the floor and above my eye level it means i have to wrestle myself out of the wheelchair to look at the controls apart from section 508 's effects on web sites and federal employees the regulations will affect the technology industry significantly though the regulations cover only purchasing by federal agencies the buying clout of the federal government more than 45 billion on information technology alone annually is pushing the industry to rethink and redesign a range of products hewlett packard for example is incorporating the accessibility standards into its product lines in large part because it does not want to develop separate lines and sees the demand for accessible products expanding to state governments and schools companies like ibm canon and adobe systems are taking similar steps but although most large corporations are aware of section 508 many small and medium size companies are being caught off guard francesca brown the federal contract market analyst for the boston information group said she found out about section 508 at a government exposition last month i was shocked said ms brown whose company is planning to sell software to government agencies i see this deadline as impractical and untenable while it certainly is a worthy act i think it 's also unrealistic section 508 was added in 1986 to the rehabilitation act of 1973 setting goals for accommodation of the disabled in federal purchasing in 1998 congress enacted legislation toughening the requirements and enforcement provisions individuals can bring legal complaints against agencies for failure to comply though they can not seek punitive damages some of the regulations are very specific for example on web pages images that blink or flicker are forbidden to flash 2 to 55 times a second to protect people with photosensitive epilepsy from having seizures triggered by the visual stimulus but other guidelines are more general for example the regulations say that if a piece of equipment requires biometric forms of user identification like a fingerprint or a retina scan there must also be an alternative process so that people without the use of their hands or eyes may use them some predict that accessibility in technology will become standard much as closed captioning is routinely included on television what we are entering here is a transition period said mr sindelar of the general services administration in five years what we are seeing as issues now will no longer be issues
 as it races to finish its 858 million expansion and renovation the museum of modern art has also been acquiring close to 40 million worth of paintings drawings and sculpture hoping to reopen in a year with an even richer permanent collection than before most prominent among the acquisitions is diver a drawing by jasper johns that is widely considered to be one of the most important works on paper of the 20th century the museum said it had also bought several other seminal works by modern masters like picasso and francis bacon these are a landmark series of acquisitions said glenn d lowry director of the museum most institutions would be thrilled to own just one of these works institutions like the whitney museum of american art and the san francisco museum of modern art have made substantially larger acquisitions over the last few years but their collections were not strong to begin with the modern 's recent purchases are substantial additions to what is already a world class collection to raise some of the money for these purchases the modern sold several artworks from its collection among them a rare 1909 cubist landscape by picasso that many experts say the museum should never have parted with officials at the modern however say they have another better picasso of the same period adding diver to the collection was something of a coup for the modern it is the most profound and intense work of art that johns has created in any medium said john elderfield the modern 's chief curator of painting and sculpture created in 1962 63 it is an unusually large drawing nearly 7 feet tall and 6 feet wide experts say it is worth well over 10 million drawn on brown paper with charcoal chalk pastel and probably watercolor the work abstractly suggests a diver in motion showing two sets of hands one touching and pointing down as though preparing to dive and the other coming back up as if the figure were rising its theme is similar to this artist 's 1963 painting periscope to hart crane both works refer to crane 's 1932 suicide by drowning diver was begun before mr johns created a painting by the same name although the drawing was not finished until afterward johns began it as a study for the painting mr elderfield said it ended up being a major picture in its own right although it is a work on paper diver will hang with mr johns 's paintings because it is considered to be of comparable scale and ambition diver had belonged to the prominent manhattan collectors victor and sally ganz who had bought it shortly after it was made from leo castelli mr johns 's dealer then mr ganz who died in 1987 was in the costume jewelry business and his wife who died in 1997 was a benefactor of educational and cultural organizations the year mrs ganz died her four children sold much of their parents collection at a christie 's auction in new york the sale brought 206 million making it the largest single owner auction in history but two of the ganz children kate and tony were so attached to diver that they kept it the two owned it jointly trading the drawing back and forth every two years it had been in the family for over 40 years kate ganz said we thought the time had come for it to be shared with others tony ganz added that owning diver was a privilege and it was our inherited responsibility to see that it went to the modern their mother had been close to kirk varnedoe the modern 's chief curator of painting and sculpture mr ganz said so the two children gave a portion of the painting to the modern in memory both of varnedoe who died in august and of their parents the museum bought the rest for an undisclosed sum with the addition of diver the museum now owns one of the world 's most comprehensive group of works by mr johns including 10 paintings 16 drawings a sculpture and more than 250 prints the modern has also added to its collection a seminal bacon triptych the painting the last major work before bacon 's death in 1992 was sold to the museum by the artist 's estate the triptych 's three panels with strangely distorted figures are derived from photographs taken by eadweard muybridge an early modern photographer known for his action figures over these are a portrait of the artist and a portrait of the brazilian race car driver ayrton senna the work has been interpreted as reflecting the struggle between the man of action and the man as artist we have much strength in early bacon but we have not been fortunate enough to cover his entire career mr lowry said missing was a monumental triptych we kept hammering away at the estate till they were ready to release this one both the bacon and the johns were works the museum spent years trying to get two sculptures that have been added to the collection came on the market only recently one is picasso 's pregnant woman 1950 which was shown at the gagosian gallery in manhattan in an exhibition of picasso sculptures this spring it was being sold by maya picasso the daughter of the artist and marie therese walter inspired by picasso 's companion francoise gilot who was pregnant with their daughter paloma the work is unique because it is fashioned from plaster rather than bronze it 's actually an assemblage mr elderfield said the breasts stomach and one of the arms are made from shards of broken pottery which picasso found in a garbage heap when i saw it i thought it looked like something that had been dug up from the earth and was thousands of years old at an auction of works from the estate of sophie taeuber arp wife of the modernist sculptor jean arp which was held in paris in june the modern bought taeuber arp 's dada head from 1920 the museum paid about 12 million for the sculpture which is a small abstract painted wood head it joins two paintings a drawing and six prints by taeuber arp already in the modern 's collection while the impetus for these purchases is the reopening of the museum on west 53rd street in manhattan the modern plans to show some of the acquisitions in early february in its temporary home in long island city queens by then there may be more acquisitions but referring to diver mr lowry said there will probably be nothing on this scale
 stock prices moved lower yesterday after alan greenspan the chairman of the federal reserve suggested in senate testimony that economic conditions did not warrant aggressive cuts in interest rates in his remarks mr greenspan played down the risk of a recession and confirmed the view that the economy was in the midst of an inventory correction in which manufacturers cut production and retailers curb purchasing to respond to a slowdown in sales his comments seemed to dash hopes the fed would move to lower short term interest rates before the next meeting of its policy makers in late march he made it clear that if the risks continue to fall on the downside the fed has more room to lower interest rates said thomas m mcmanus chief equity strategist at banc of america securities but he did not give the market any confidence of an intermeeting cut stock prices gained in early trading mainly because of a report showing that january retail sales were stronger than expected but market gauges began to deteriorate by early afternoon as traders and investors digested mr greenspan 's remarks the dow jones industrial average fell 4345 points or 04 percent to 1090332 the standard poor 's 500 stock index slipped 1151 points or 09 percent to 131880 and the nasdaq composite index slumped 6194 points or 25 percent to 242772 if you are a prudent investor you can take some comfort from greenspan 's view that the economy is not unraveling said jonathan olesky head of block trading at morgan stanley dean witter but the market was willing to trade an unraveling economy for more rate cuts about as many stocks rose in price as those that fell on the new york stock exchange trading volume was slightly more than one billion shares on the big board drug stocks led by pfizer contributed to the weakness in the dow and s p 500 pfizer fell 109 to 4503 after regulators asked the company to withhold an experimental drug from patients merck a dow component dropped 223 to 8075 and bristol myers squibb declined 212 to 6304 big technology companies like intel cisco systems jds uniphase and brocade communications systems were among the big nasdaq losers intel fell 213 to 3244 after an analyst at credit suisse first boston downgraded his rating on the shares cisco slipped 106 to 2850 jds uniphase fell 213 to 3850 and brocade a manufacturer of switches that link computer servers and data storage systems fell 956 to 5344 applied materials the semiconductor maker was also punished shares fell 275 to 4125 after the market closed the company reported fourth quarter earnings that beat lowered forecasts in after hours trading the stock was quoted at 4150 up 25 cents a share treasury prices mixed by reuters bond prices were mixed yesterday after alan greenspan the federal reserve chairman said the economy faced near term risks to growth but was not in recession and should recover by the end of the year treasuries which had been bracing for a much more dour economic prognosis in mr greenspan 's semiannual report to congress gave up some ground as dealers bet the fed might not need to cut interest rates as sharply as some had forecast the price of the benchmark 10 year treasury note fell 4 32 to 99 17 32 its yield which moves in the opposite direction from the price rose to 506 percent from 504 percent on monday the 30 year bond rose 2 32 to 99 14 32 its yield fell to 541 percent from 542 percent
 hitting yet another snag in its nascent internet service the comcast corporation said yesterday that it was scrambling to repair an e mail failure that had left as many as 300000 customers unable to receive messages starting at 10 pm wednesday customers were able to receive e mail messages intermittently but by noon yesterday they were unable to receive them at all said dave watson executive vice president for marketing at comcast mr watson said the company hoped to restore full e mail service by late last night but if not would work around the clock to do so this is just the latest stumble for comcast a cable operator that provides high speed internet access to about 950000 customers until last year comcast provided the service in partnership with excite home but when excite home went bankrupt comcast set out to build its own internet network initially comcast infuriated many internet subscribers particularly in the new jersey and detroit areas who said they could not get access to e mail and the web then earlier this week the company faced criticism from privacy advocates who said comcast was tracking subscriber internet traffic patterns in a way that could allow it to follow individual surfing habits comcast announced on wednesday that it would modify its practices in the latest trouble mr watson said the company had a problem with its e mail distribution servers which are powerful computers responsible for distributing to individual users the e mail messages received by the comcast system mr watson said the servers had continued to receive incoming mail and were storing it for distribution when the technical problem was solved mr watson said the problem affected only users who relied on a comcast e mail account and that subscribers who relied on a different service like a residual one from home were unaffected in a larger sense mr watson said the problems for comcast are a result of the effort to deploy an internet service in very short order these are early stage issues he said noting that other internet companies have faced similar problems but that 's not an excuse for us the problems also hark back to legal arguments made by excite home when it went bankrupt excite home sought to put pressure on its cable partners like comcast and att to pay more for its service arguing that they were underestimating the difficulty and expense of operating an internet network

 remember the doublemint twins remember jingles like hi ho hey hey chew your little troubles away the wm wrigley jr company is working hard to make you forget them faster than your chewing gum loses its flavor on the bedpost wrigley the nation 's leading maker of gum is accelerating ambitious efforts to convince consumers particularly those ages 12 to 34 who buy and chew gum at rates far higher than their older counterparts that the company long ago put behind it dated devices like hokey songs and spookily ever smiling models after remaking the advertising and promotion for brands like big red juicy fruit orbit and winterfresh wrigley is updating two of its most venerable products wrigley 's spearmint and doublemint in a pair of multimillion dollar campaigns infused with snappy humor the longtime wrigley agency bbdo chicago is promoting reformulations and redesigned packaging for spearmint introduced in 1893 and doublemint brought out in 1914 there is also a new theme for spearmint now you wo n't want to chew on anything else in the brand 's first campaign in five years as well as one for doublemint feel the green and now feel it longer though doublemint retains a duality approach the twins have been replaced by 21st century sisters the tennis stars serena and venus williams what we did was relevant for consumers in its day and worked in its time said paul chibe director for united states consumer marketing at wrigley in chicago there 's definitely an opportunity to have wrigley be much more attuned to consumers today the revamping of the pitches for doublemint and spearmint is indicative of the re energizing of the somnolent wrigley marketing machinery by a new chief executive bill wrigley jr who also recently made an audacious ultimately unsuccessful bid to acquire the hershey foods corporation bill is a guy very much focused on the future with a healthy dose of impatience said phillip gant executive vice president and chief creative officer at the chicago office of bbdo worldwide part of the omnicom group he has much more of a vision of the possibilities the brand images can have to help stimulate growth in an increasingly competitive confectionery field mr wrigley is eager for consumers to at long last perceive wrigley 's advertising products and promotions as contemporary there is enormous equity in the wrigley brand and its product brands but the problem is that the company has n't been relating to the next generation of consumers for its survival said raleigh c green principal at corporate voice in new york which specializes in online brand communications the younger generation is smart and media savvy he added and needs to be talked to not talked down to at the same time for the makeover to be effective it must avoid damaging positive elements of the company 's image like its hard earned reputation for selling tasty inexpensive treats obviously it 's a fine line you 're walking when you update heritage brands said michael cucka a partner at group 1066 in new york a corporate identity consultant wrigley has been understated throughout its history an alternative to the carnival style shouting at the gum counter he added do you stay true to who you are or do you take a risk wrigley has decided to pursue a strategy characterized by the oxymoron of careful risk when consumers are asked for their reaction to wrigley 's shift to a more modern marketing voice most people say 'about time mr gant said because the previous approach was kitsch for a lot of them as a result for so long people did n't notice the advertising it was wallpaper he added if you 're doing advertising people ca n't relate to it 's hard to weave the brands into the fabric of american culture to accomplish that now bbdo chicago is taking a playful approach to re presenting the doublemint and spearmint personas for doublemint print and outdoor advertising shows bold images with wry headlines one ad for example featuring a luscious shot of a green wrapped venus williams carries the headline mint that hits the sweet spot which has a nudge nudge double meaning for tennis fans another ad featuring an oversize shot of a smiling young man carries the headline mint sweet enough to show some love borrowing a phrase from the urban vernacular for spearmint there are radio commercials along with the print and outdoor ads the spots avoid jingles in favor of humor that is uncharacteristically cartoonish for wrigley for instance in one spot a man is dressed in pants made of redwood and turned loose in a boxcar filled with crazed beavers which prefer to chew on spearmint rather than him in another commercial a man is dressed like a wounded seal and dropped into shark infested waters the sharks have chosen longer lasting spearmint the announcer intones except for that one he did n't get any and he 's mad the spot ends with jaws  like music and screaming it 's a smart strategy said dr robert passikoff president at brand keys in new york a brand and customer loyalty consulting company it allows them to position their gums as being modern and cool which is what they need to do dr passikoff likened the campaigns to one bbdo chicago created for a newer wrigley brand orbit spoofing serious product demonstrations with mock gum tests in our research a lot of older people complained about the orbit ads he said laughing and we said 'guess what they were n't made for you bbdo chicago has created wrigley ads since 1979 when it acquired the arthur meyerhoff agency which began working for wrigley in 1933 the budgets for the doublemint and spearmint campaigns are being estimated at 10 million each wrigley spent 79 million in major media to advertise doublemint last year according to the cmr division of taylor nelson sofres and nothing on spearmint sales of spearmint in the 52 weeks that ended sept 8 totaled 211 million according to information resources down 47 percent from the period a year ago and sales of doublemint totaled 373 million down 72 percent

to the extremes of pillage destruction naked war lawrence durrell wrote it was as if its beauty was too much for them and they went berserk traders followed the invaders in the early 1600 's portuguese and dutch ships put in at marseille with among other exotic imports calico chintz and printed cottons from india known even in english as indiennes the gaily colored prints were immediately embraced by louis xiv in 1664 he had his minister colbert form the compagnie des indes orientales to import indian fabrics and goods the company sent spies to india to learn the secrets of printing and dyeing the cottons the nobility adopted the colorful indiennes for court dress moliere satirized the vogue in his first production of le bourgeois gentilhomme in 1670 outfitting his hero in a rainbow of printed indiennes intentionally worn upside down french textile producers set up workshops to make indiennes and began a thriving business they carved flowers arabesques and other motifs on laminated blocks of fruitwood then applied the blocks to the cotton by hand one color at a time using natural dyes made from plants and minerals the colors were strong and vibrant blue the color of a gauloise cigarette box mustard yellow terra cotta red and raspberry pink lavender and bright green over time new motifs were incorporated local vines flowers insects and herbs provencal women liked to cover themselves with the luxuriant foliage indiennes were worn in layers as scarves aprons blouses and long quilted skirts men wore vests and doublets in provence one could determine people 's social rank by the style of indienne bedecked clothes they wore by the late 17th century french made indiennes achieved such popularity that jealous wool and silk makers persuaded the government to ban their production in france though unevenly enforced the interdiction lasted from 1686 until 1759 the government did n't mind instituting the decree the compagnie des indes earned a lot of money said colette nicollin president and owner of souleiado the major producer of provencal cottons today in france indian cottons were very expensive not to be thwarted after the royal ban provencal manufacturers moved to the comtat venaissin a part of france near avignon that was under the jurisdiction of the popes until the french revolution souleiado is not the only producer of such prints today but it is the oldest established in 1806 in a former capuchin convent near tarascon an ancient roman city on the banks of the rhone under different names the company has been owned by just a few families for two centuries never ceasing production despite wars and revolutions in 1916 it was bought by charles henri demery who passed it down to his nephew charles demery in 1937 in 1939 it was named souleiado the word in old provencal means a ray of sun shining through the clouds after a rain the printing workshops were installed in a 17th century limestone hotel particulier a mansion situated between a courtyard and a garden in the center of tarascon where it remains the younger demery adopted the indiennes for home decoration fashion faience and accessories in 1950 he opened the first souleiado boutique in florence demand so exceeded supply that he began to have the cottons printed in factories instead of by hand blocking in 1977 charles demery brought the company back to life said michel biehn a decorator based near tarascon mr biehn who owns la maison biehn a source of rare vintage provencal textiles and costumes wrote a 1987 book on traditional costumes made with indiennes his view is shared by karl friberg chief executive of motif designs in new rochelle ny the wholesale distributor of souleiado fabrics and wallpaper in the united states charles demery had so much charisma he did n't need to be a good businessman mr friberg said francophiles loved whatever he sold americans embraced souleiado in the 1970 's after pierre moulin and pierre levec started displaying the colorful prints in their greenwich village antiques shop pierre deux in 1984 these dealers wrote with linda dannenberg pierre deux 's french country a book that popularized souleiado along with provencal antiques pottery gardens and decor eventually they sold their name to an investment group that started the pierre deux stores which carried souleiado goods when the company was restructured in the late 1980 's it switched its allegiance to another provencal manufacturer of cotton prints today souleiado fabrics and wallpapers are available through motif designs 800 431 2424 and at souleiado boutiques in westport and chester conn los angeles and brentwood calif portland ore phoenix chagrin falls ohio and bar harbor me when charles demery died in 1986 his son jean pierre took over he opened a private museum in the company 's tarascon headquarters that is an ode to provence with 18th century costumes a reconstructed dye making and printing workshop pottery and a display of the 40000 18th  and 19th century carved wood blocks the museum offers classes in block printing provencal quiltmaking embroidery and lacemaking michel biehn helped to create the museum i tried to build up the collection of traditional costumes and worked on the installation he said we also wanted to show the origins of the hand blocked indiennes 18th  and 19th century provencal handicrafts in the 1990 's souleiado started to fail financially it was bought last july by louis and colette nicollin she is a native of the camargue region near marseille jean pierre wanted to create communicate sell in fact do everything mrs nicollin said it was too much when he came to us we were happy to help to take the company back to its roots she hired a paris couturier team vincent millet and yannick flageul to create a women 's ready to wear line with hand blocked prints from the souleiado archives mr millet said the line was inspired by the fierce provencal wind known as the mistral the collection is all about movement and fluidity mr millet said we went back to the original wood blocks and tried to interpret them in a new way by printing by hand on denim we are using traditional materials and motifs in a new way the collection will be shown at the nicollins house near marseille on sunday information 011 33 1 40410427 what 's next in september at the maison et objets fair in paris souleiado will introduce a new line of linens glass ware pottery and accessories their wood blocks are their crown jewels mr biehn said that is what they should build on
 it may have been an aversion to baseball or to politics or both but american television viewers displayed a rare hunger for their nightly ration of prime time network entertainment in the first week of the new television season which resulted in impressive to outstanding performances by a number of new network offerings as well as by several returning favorites the delay in starting the new television season pushed back from mid september to october by the olympic coverage on nbc may also have made viewers eager to rid themselves of repeats and get back to their network viewing habits whatever the reason the first week 's ratings indicate that as many as four or five new series may be on the way to hit status while two established shows the west wing on nbc and everybody loves raymond on cbs look as if they are about to emerge as challengers to the likes of er and friends as the top drama and comedy on television the west wing only in its second year was the most watched show of the week with a season premiere audience of 251 million raymond meanwhile had its biggest audience ever last week 22 million and followed that up with a second episode on monday seen by close to 20 million but it was the news for new series that had many network programmers considering cartwheels among the shows pulling in surprisingly big initial audiences were dark angel on fox ed on nbc and csi the district and even a much maligned comedy yes dear on cbs other new shows performed well though not quite as eye catchingly including gilmore girls on wb titans and deadline on nbc and that 's life and the fugitive on cbs that cbs has no fewer than five new shows off to strong starts with both of its better reviewed comedies bette and welcome to new york set to start up tonight is one indicator that it is the network with the most momentum cbs won the week in terms of most viewers with an average of 145 million but startlingly cbs even won the week among the audience that its competitors always say is the big one adults between the ages of 18 and 49 nbc was clearly hurt by losing its big thursday night to the vice presidential debate still this is the first time cbs has won a premiere week in that young adult category since 1991 at least part of the reason cbs may be doing better with younger viewers is the opportunity the network had to expose its roster of new series to the huge audience much of it young that watched survivor on cbs this summer the explanation for the strong performance of ed may have been similarly linked to mass promotional exposure during the olympics or it may have had something to do with getting some of the best reviews of any new show this season ed soared on sunday for nbc delivering the highest ratings for an nbc premiere on a sunday in six years that made it a sensational week for david letterman 's worldwide pants production company which also owns raymond the explanation for the initial success of dark angel is a bit less lofty in essence fox skipped out on the usual expectation that each broadcast network without a sports obligation carry the presidential debate so that dark angel could face off against baseball and the debate a result was hit numbers for the new action series from the director of titanic james cameron fox executives acknowledged that it would take time to see how well angel would fare against regular competition that may be true of all the new shows most of which used the less than avid interest in this year 's baseball playoffs to grab viewers in the first week usually the television season starts with a horde of new shows all jumping in at the same time this season because baseball has played on two networks many new shows have had a chance to get on the air less challenged by entertainment series and the news has not been universally good for new shows nbc 's comedy block from 8 to 9 on monday daddio and tucker is off to a dreadful start with tucker looking as if it may be the first show to wear a cancellation bull 's eye this season that woeful performance damaged deadline which fared reasonably well in its first try then fell back on monday abc 's friday night comedy lineup hugely promoted all summer barely stirred a ripple of interest last week with one new series the trouble with normal looking most troubled while another new comedy madigan men showed just a trace of life on fox freakylinks on friday struggled though the network liked its reach with teenagers and young adults but in the new season 's first week the disappointments were actually outnumbered by pleasant surprises and that has not happened since well nobody can remember the last time that happened
 the justices of the illinois supreme court have decided that all the state 's judges deserve cost of living raises themselves included so they have ordered the government to pay them more but others in this deficit ridden state disagree including the governor and the comptroller who writes the checks that has set off a storm of legal maneuvers that threaten to leave the comptroller in contempt of court and some of the state 's best paid workers judges suing the governor in their own courts i would n't say that this is a constitutional crisis comptroller daniel w hynes said this afternoon but it is a constitutional clash facing a state budget crisis aides to gov rod r blagojevich say now is no time to pay judges more not when state departments are slashing budgets and when other top level employees will be going without raises so this month mr blagojevich vetoed a 28 percent cost of living increase for the more than 900 judges that would have cost 38 million judges here earn more than 127000 a year supreme court justices who earn 158000 would receive an extra 4000 a year with the increase in the worst fiscal crisis in illinois history with a 5 billion deficit you have to make tough choices a spokeswoman for mr blagojevich cheryle jackson said between investing millions for well paid judges or investing in health care for children or in preschool for at risk children the choice is clear but the justices apparently did not see it that way after two sets of terse letters were exchanged between the courts administrative offices and the comptroller 's office the justices weighed in on thursday they ordered the state to give judges raises stating that the governor 's veto might have removed the financing for them but that the action did not remove a legislative resolution from 1990 that required judges to be given annual cost of living increases the state 's constitution the justices pointed out ensures that judges salaries not be diminished in their terms in office supporters of the justices argue that the dispute is not simply a matter of cash but of a crucial legal principle that is part of the constitution that judges must not have their salaries dropped at the whim of elected officials who might then punish judges for rulings with which they disagree a spokesman for the illinois supreme court joseph tybor declined to comment this afternoon citing a flurry of pending litigation among the legal claims and counterclaims are judges suing mr blagojevich and mr hynes in cook county circuit court and mr hynes asking the supreme court to vacate its order the question legal scholars said may center on how the annual increase should be defined is it really a raise or is it something else and is the state diminishing a judge 's salary if it does not give a cost of living adjustment the question becomes whether cola is part of the salary already said dawn clark netsch who teaches law at northwestern university and is a former state comptroller it comes down to the language if the adjustment is not a raise but a legally required annual change in a judge 's salary then the state can not constitutionally take it away supporters of the justices argued if they remove it they are reducing a judge 's salary and the constitution provides that they can not do that said kevin m forde a lawyer who represents judges in the cook county suit and the purpose is not because the founding fathers were so interested in protecting judges as persons it is to protect the public so that judges may be independent david a novoselsky a lawyer who represents his father a judge in a separate legal complaint filed against mr hynes in state supreme court said the issue was not money his father benjamin is 87 they will happily donate the raise david novoselsky said adding i care about the principle the us constitution has a provision in it similar to the one in illinois 's constitution you can not reduce the salary of a judge but mr hynes said he intended to issue checks with no raises when the judges receive their monthly salaries on thursday the last day of the month the supreme court he said reached its order telling him to pay without going through the proper process of a hearing there are legitimate legal arguments on both sides mr hynes said theirs was not an enforceable order there was no lawsuit filed at that time no parties were heard one branch of government can not just mandate that another do what it says mr hynes who earns 116000 said he would not be receiving a raise this year

 the track of qlogic seems to illustrate that sanity has returned to the technology sector after three long years qlogic makes switches and controllers that manage the flow of data between computers and their storage systems unlike many other technology companies it has managed to remain profitable over the last two years in its fiscal 2003 which ends march 31 qlogic is expected to earn 108 million or 115 a share on sales of 440 million and the company has a beautiful balance sheet with about 600 million in cash and no debt excluding that cash at friday 's close of 3568 a share qlogic trades at about 25 times earnings which does not seem unreasonable for a company whose profit margins approach those of microsoft but some short sellers and analysts argue that qlogic is less enticing than it first appears the case they make should give pause to anyone who thinks that tech stocks are ready to rally qlogic 's exceptional margins result largely from the fact that it has only one major competitor emulex in its most important business making host bus adapters do n't ask right now it 's a duopoly said ashok kumar a technology analyst at us bancorp piper jaffray but in the next year a new generation of technology based on open standards will hit the market and qlogic and emulex will face new competition they 'll have to try to compete against the intels and the broadcoms of the world and they do n't have a prayer mr kumar said it 's a disaster waiting to happen even before then qlogic faces the risk that fujitsu its largest customer providing one sixth of its sales will exit the disk drive business you have technology transition risk and you have customer risk mr kumar said these are clear and present dangers he said fiscal 2004 when qlogic is expected to make about 130 a share could be its peak earnings year h k desai chairman of qlogic said it had planned for two years for a potential transition to new standards and was prepared to compete with anyone we are technology agnostics mr desai said in any case the transition will probably happen more slowly than mr kumar expects because companies are loath to adopt a new standard if their current systems are working mr desai said and even if fujitsu quits the business qlogic may lose no more than 8 percent of its overall sales because it will gain business with other customers mr desai said qlogic 's shares are certainly a better bet today than they were at the height of the technology bubble in march 2000 when they reached 190 but given the risks should they really trade at 25 times earnings qlogic is a solid well run company but even after falling 80 percent in three years it may be overpriced relative to its growth prospects and competitive position in this it 's hardly alone consider oracle trading at 30 times 2003 earnings or sun microsystems losing money now and selling at 35 times estimated earnings for its 2004 fiscal year investors are paying those prices because they believe that big technology companies will be able to return to the profit levels they had at the peak three years ago but those profits resulted from a once in a generation binge in technology investment fueled by the year 2000 software changeover and huge spending from newly public internet companies they are not coming back not for a while technology remains a brutal business with short product cycles and constant compression in prices and margins unless you happen to be microsoft so it 's hard to understand why these companies justify multiples above the market 's average price to earnings ratio now about 15 get used to it

 new york city 's budget shortfall could top 6 billion which would make it more than a billion dollars worse than mayor michael r bloomberg projected according to a report issued yesterday by comptroller william c thompson jr mr thompson also stated that much of the state and federal assistance that mr bloomberg was seeking to help close the deficit in the year beginning july 1 was not likely to occur warning that the city could fall 456 million short of its target in that area if that were to happen mr bloomberg would have to try to carry out most of his contingency plan which calls for 500 million in further budget cuts that he has described in the past as onerous and painful the contingency plan would cut school aid further shrink the size of the police department more eliminate fire companies from eight firehouses that currently hold two each reduce garbage pickups and lay off workers washington and albany must now stand up and realize that new york city is not crying wolf and that we need additional help mr thompson said in a statement mayor bloomberg puts the budget deficit at nearly 5 billion and has repeatedly expressed optimism that he will get the state and federal help he seeks the mayor 's aides said yesterday that they believed their projections would hold while we stand by the accuracy of our analysis the comptroller 's report reminds of the severity of the city 's fiscal problems said jordan barowitz a spokesman for the mayor mr bloomberg a republican wants to close the deficit by borrowing cutting services and getting help from washington albany and the unions the city council which is overwhelmingly democratic and must pass the budget in june wants to raise the income tax and to restore a commuter tax on people who work in the city but live elsewhere mr thompson one of two citywide elected democrats calls for restoring the commuter tax but not for raising the income tax in a speech last month he said that other tax increases are not the preferred course and were unlikely to be approved in albany the comptroller 's report says that the budget gap will grow for two basic reasons the city will take in less in taxes than the mayor expects because the economy will be slow to recover and the city will need to spend more than it expects on overtime pension costs labor contracts public assistance and legal judgments the report cast doubt on the mayor 's contingency plan it is unlikely that the city can achieve all of these savings given that some elements are unlikely to be approved by the city council or are programmatically undesirable it said
 a decade has passed since fox acquired national football league television rights and established rupert murdoch 's network as a viable competitor to its three rivals the fox contingent that vowed to nfl owners that it would respect the game launch broadcast television 's first one hour pregame show and expand the game 's technological vistas was not completely certain that the league would jettison cbs after 38 years i went home to england and told my wife joan 'it 'll never happen said david hill chairman of the fox sports television group who was running murdoch 's sky sports at the time not in my wildest dreams did i think the league would let cbs go but money did not just talk it hollered fox would spend an average 395 million annually through 1997 for the national football conference contract fox 's pre emptive maneuver helped raise television sports rights fees while revolutionizing sports broadcasts with innovations that included the fox box pregame comics and ultra slow motion replays the nfl gave fox a platform to strengthen a weak station lineup and create a miniempire outstripped by only espn 's manifest destiny fox subsequently acquired additional sports rights including those to major league baseball and nascar it created cable 's fox sports net which works better as a confederation of regional sports networks that carry local games than as a full fledged national network competing with espn fox sports net tried and failed for example to sustain a news operation against sportscenter all of this sprang from the football contract fox developed the fox box the catchercam and the glowing hockey puck installed a football field in its nfl studio added microphones to bases and outfield walls sandwiched replays between whooshes and in cooperation with nbc and tnt inaugurated the satellite based nascar driver identification system fox 's presence is the prime reason for the increase in rights fees fees that would eventually cause the network to write off 909 million from the value of its nascar major league baseball and nfl deals its macho boisterous and carefree attitude has yielded comedians and a female weather forecaster with sex appeal on its fox nfl sunday studio program along with the nightly guyfest led by the comic actor tom arnold on fox sports net 's best damn sports show period a title that perfectly illustrates the fox ethos dick ebersol the chairman of nbc sports said they demystified a lot of stuff and showed that you can have a lot of fun some of us disagreed with some of it but it was the right thing to do the fox box with the score clock and other information in an upper corner of the tv screen symbolizes fox 's investment in graphic and electronic technology hill developed it in 1992 for soccer on sky sports murdoch 's satellite service in england after watching a match that offered the viewer little basic information it was one rainy sunday afternoon and for reasons i 'm not sure of i was very attached to the chelsea football club he said i 'm watching for 20 minutes i do n't know the score or when it started and i 'm going nuts his wife asked him to tone down his language hill told her if i ever do soccer i 'll put the time and score up so people wo n't be in this position not long after the fox box appeared on sky an espn production official saw it and adapted it for its world cup telecasts in 1994 hill then brought it to football hockey and baseball and all other networks with nbc 's belated acquiescence followed suit each adapting in its own way in recent years the fox box has morphed into a strip across the top of the screen hill now hopes to expand upon the recent mega slo mo technology which brought a new dimension to baseball replays to find a way to show a ball wrap around a bat at the moment of impact neal pilson who was the president of cbs sports when it lost its nfl rights admires much of what fox has created though he is not enthusiastic about pregame comedians and buxom weather forecasters they 've never felt constrained by prior practices pilson an industry consultant said they brought a bold attitude to sports that really broke up the three network club that existed before they arrived one can easily argue that the addition of the comedian jimmy kimmel to fox 's nfl pregame show in 1999 led to abc sports in 2000 hiring the caustic comic dennis miller for monday night football and one can draw a straight line between the success of the raucous over the top style of fox nfl sunday and cbs 's continued efforts to bring a similar camaraderie and notice to its rival program the nfl today what is undeniable is that fox 's aggressive moves to acquire sports properties as building blocks for a stronger network led industry rights fees to soar fox became the fourth bidder in an arena accustomed to three had fox never entered the nfl bidding the league may not have secured its eight year 18 billion deal which includes cbs but not nbc now paying an average 500 million a year abc and espn may not have paid 600 million over five years to take nhl rights away from fox in 1999 and possibly nascar would not be entering the fourth year of a 28 billion deal with fox nbc and tnt hill said that fox lost the bidding for the rights to carry the pga tour the ncaa men 's basketball tournament and the olympics we are he said tongue seemingly in cheek tempered in all ways

 a minnesota teenager who the authorities said created a virulent version of the blaster computer worm was arrested yesterday morning by federal investigators who were tracking the origin of the worm that wreaked havoc on users of microsoft windows federal law enforcement officials said that the teenager jeffrey lee parson 18 of hopkins minn was acting alone when he copied the blaster virus and wrote a variant known as blasterb mr parsons who used the internet name teekid was able to develop the b version by modifying codes of the original virus federal authorities in seattle have taken the lead in the investigation because microsoft 's headquarters are in nearby redmond they said mr parson had no connection to those responsible for unleashing the original blaster worm it and its variants have affected more than 500000 computers worldwide and cost north american companies 13 billion according to computer security experts mr parson was arrested at his home at 8 am yesterday after a search there on aug 19 by agents of the federal bureau of investigation and the secret service who seized seven computers federal investigators working with microsoft were able to find mr parson by intentionally infecting a computer with the virus and then watching it connect to a web site wwwt33kidcom which they eventually linked to mr parson the creator of the site by hacker standards mr parson apparently did not hide his tracks very well he is said to have changed the name of a file to teekidexe which is similar to his internet pseudonym that simplified the task of finding him for law enforcement agencies and antivirus researchers who maintain files on thousands of hackers around the world mr parson was placed under house arrest yesterday barred from access to his computers and was scheduled to appear in federal district court in seattle on sept 17 the criminal complaint filed by the united states attorney for the western district of washington said mr parson intentionally caused and tried to cause damage to a protected computer if convicted he could be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in prison and a 250000 fine the authorities said the blasterb variant infected at least 7000 individual computers and it also used those computers to attack or try to attack microsoft 's web site wwwwindowsupdatecom neither mr parson nor his parents returned phone calls left at the family 's home the authorities in seattle said the arrest should serve as a stern warning to computer hackers there 's no thrill to this said john mckay the united states attorney in seattle the handcuffs are not cyberhandcuffs they were real cuffs this morning attorney general john ashcroft issued a statement saying cyberhacking is not joy riding hacking disrupts lives and victimizes innocent people across the nation but the arrest brought investigators no closer to finding the culprits responsible for creating the original blaster virus even as they continue the hunt for the hackers behind the virus known as sobigf which also struck recently mr mckay said that the agency had evidence concerning the author of the original virus but declined to give details the original blaster worm a viruslike program known by a variety of names including w32blaster msblast and w32 lovsan struck corporate computer systems on aug 11 and was among the most damaging computer viruses to date it struck just days before the sobigf virus was sent to millions of e mail addresses throughout the world blaster which was a network worm that struck mainly corporations brought network traffic to a halt and compromised company data sobigf was aimed at home personal computer users and small companies the version that mr parson developed was relatively limited in its effect by the time the b variant hit most companies had already taken action to defend against further attacks computer security experts said security experts say that creating a variant of an existing worm is a relatively easy task compared with creating the original malicious code in some cases requiring only a few changes in the original worm 's code he took an existing worm and tweaked it said dr peter tippett founder and chief technologist at trusecure a computer security consulting company in herndon va over the last five years there have been about 150 writers of major harmful viruses dr tippett said of those roughly 20 have been identified only about 10 have been prosecuted dr tippett said sophisticated hackers are able to cover their tracks by connecting to a variety of anonymous servers scattered throughout the world but novice perpetrators may be inclined to brag about their work in the cyberunderworld the authorities said that is what mr parson did

 it was a year ago that edward f stancik the special new york city schools investigator issued the finding that dozens of teachers and 2 principals in 32 schools had helped students cheat on standardized reading and math tests used to rank schools and promote students mr stancik said the methods from teachers using palm cards to overzealous test coaching were so varied and widespread that they could only be the tip of the iceberg but a year later a former school inspector hired by the teachers union has reinvestigated the allegations and accused mr stancik of padding evidence of cheating to make wrongdoing look far more pervasive than it was and of shoddy and unfair investigative methods the investigator thomas d thacher 2nd a former inspector general of the school construction authority found that of the 9 teachers dismissed outright 3 have been offered reinstatement and that 15 others who were the subject of disciplinary hearings were back in the classroom mr stancik 's post was set up 10 years ago to investigate recurring corruption in city schools but successive chancellors have accused him of exaggerating problems in a quest for media attention his supporters say he is a much needed outside check on a huge school system that has been inept and sluggish in investigating itself mr thacher said that mr stancik 's investigators ignored evidence that pointed toward the innocence of at least 35 out of more than 50 educators accused of cheating routinely declined to interview teachers when they asked for a union representative or lawyer to be present and ignored some eyewitnesses in classrooms where cheating was alleged to have taken place one 11 year old girl a student at ps 99 in queens was interviewed when she was home only with her 14 year old brother mr thacher said the boy let the two men in because they showed badges and he lacked the confidence to say no according to mr thacher the cheating report mr thacher said was so flawed that it lacked credibility amounting to nothing more than a terrible miscarriage of justice randi weingarten the union 's president at a news conference with mr thacher called on the board of education to review the charges against all the teachers the union said it hired mr thacher now president of his own private investigation firm because of his reputation as a thorough and scrupulous investigator mr stancik stood by his report yesterday saying that he would not be intimidated and that mr thacher 's report represents nothing more than the union 's desire to protect dishonest educators in an interview mr stancik said that in hundreds of interviews conducted during the cheating investigation his office might have made some mistakes but that it 's like during the jfk assassination listing 100 interesting things and saying 'see it was a conspiracy in one case study mr thacher said a teacher rebecca ballantine had been wrongfully accused of cheating because of a sudden spike in the test scores of her students in his december 1999 report mr stancik accused ms ballantine a seventh grade teacher at intermediate school 450 in the east village of major transgressions including directing children to check their answers during the test or pick another answer interviews with students mr thacher said made it clear that what mr stancik had construed as cheating had actually occurred during practice examinations he said mr stancik had failed to interview a proctor during the exam who later said ms ballantine was innocent miss ballantine her eyes glistening apparently with tears attended the news conference yesterday and described the experience of being accused of cheating as devastating she added it changed my life in very huge ways it was hard for everyone i know family friends also colleagues at my school as an untenured teacher she was dismissed the day after mr stancik released his findings she was later offered reinstatement she said mr stancik stood by his findings in ms ballantine 's case yesterday saying that his investigators had originally suspected all of is 450 because of high numbers of erasures on test sheets but had been able to substantiate cheating only in her class and in the class of a colleague mayor rudolph w giuliani ridiculed the thacher report yesterday saying that the uft hired someone to reach the result they wanted to reach and i think it really is a shame both ms weingarten and mr thacher took pains yesterday to say they were not denying that cheating had occurred in some cases but mr thacher said that mr stancik had aggregated data over four years and many test administrations and he noted that the accused educators amounted to 05 percent of the 102000 educators in the city system long after it had completed its investigation mr thacher said mr stancik 's office sent a series of thank you notes to the parents of several children who had been questioned the notes warned that the teacher 's union has hired private investigators who may try to ask your child about the answers given to our investigators they went on to advise the parents that they did not have to allow their children to be interviewed but if they did you have the right to be present after getting such a thank you note the mother of the 11 year old girl who was interviewed while her parents were at work wrote a letter of complaint to mr stancik accusing his investigators of using gestapto like tactics mr stancik said yesterday that the investigators believed the 14 year old boy to be 18 and legally an adult
 the amateur draft was the topic of discussion between representatives of the owners and the players yesterday but they did not get too far in solving that element of their attempt to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement the union last week agreed to a single draft of domestic and foreign players but the two sides had differences the owners negotiators tried to address some of them dealing with baseball academies in latin america the union said that major league baseball and not individual teams should operate the academies the owners said they were willing to guarantee a minimum number of academies so that there would be enough places for teenage players in those countries to go if individual clubs did n't want to operate whatever number that was agreed on management lawyers said baseball would find someone to run them we have a ways to go rob manfred baseball 's chief lawyer acknowledged michael weiner a union lawyer agreed that not a tremendous amount of progress was made on the draft

 q you wrote your book lucky man without a ghostwriter did you find that writing uses a different set of muscles than acting it 's not even a set of muscles it 's a completely different behavior the thing about performing as an actor is that there are all these artists and artisans everybody doing whatever their discipline is and it 's like this big river you show up you have a cup of coffee people put makeup on you and you can take a little time to figure out what everybody 's doing and what your direction is going to be within all of that with writing it 's like standing naked at the edge of a lake you wake up every day and try to figure out if you 've got the energy to cross it it sounds daunting did you hate it oh i loved it a lot there really is something about saying this is the way that i want to say this and no amount of lighting or background casting or art direction is going to change it in any way so is writing the future for you i think i 'll still be involved in television and film but probably more as a director or producer and potentially now as a writer i think that 's opened up to me in the sense that i have a belief that i could finish something that was a great part about the book finishing it so now i think when i say that would make a terrific pilot or this would make a terrific film i know that i can actually sit down and with a certain amount of you know agony i 'll get to the other end of it in the book you offer a pretty harsh indictment of the world of celebrity it 's not meant to be so much an indictment as a there but for the grace of god go i not that i did n't go some places that were very godless and very graceless but at some point clearly i made a decision that i was n't going to set up permanent housekeeping in this place that was n't connected to the rest of the world it was n't necessarily a virtuous act where i looked at things and chose humanity it was more i have n't got whatever it takes to pull that off bottom line is it 's a great ride it 's terrific to have financial independence it 's even more terrific to be able to express yourself creatively and to have it be an actual vocation but at the end of the day it 's all kind of silly i was trying to explain to my son sam i said you know when you 're over at your friend 's house and you say 'you pretend you 're this and i 'll pretend i 'm that that 's my job it 's terrific but it does n't mean that i have a solution for the afghanistan situation which as a celebrity you might be expected to have that 's what i 'm saying once you kind of give in to it you can really build a network of support for just about any venture when i met my wife tracy i was already kind of thinking about some of these issues and then very quickly after that my son was born and my father passed and then i was diagnosed with parkinson 's a real saving grace for me has been not wanting to sacrifice my canadian politeness it really has been a major part of the way i approach my success and the challenges of this part of my life i 'm still very aware of what the rules are it took me a long time to get used to the new york jaywalking thing you 've lived in new york for 12 years do you feel like a new yorker i do there is something about this city where we all know we 're in it together you can say sweeping things about new york versus los angeles that new york is n't monoindustrial it 's not all about the business and smog but i love its juxtapositions and interactions donald trump has to walk by the korean grocer you 're more likely to step on a new yorker 's foot than you are to step on the foot of an angeleno you 're more likely to bump into an angeleno 's car and then the only kind of discourse over that distance is a bullet which to me is not preferable to someone saying your mother is a whore like in new york i love that about the city how have you found life here different since 9 11 one of the difficult things about the book was that i was writing the last quarter of it around the time of 9 11 and there was this great urge to contextualize it i 'm really glad that i did n't because while there are connections just on the level of personal grief and coping with change i did n't think it would have been an appropriate correlation to make down the line tragedy is egalitarian it was one of those moments where everybody was brought to the same level briefly at least remember all those obituaries for the ironic and the trivial those all went by the wayside the trivial is right back with its cockroach like staying power and it 's got deeper roots david rakoff

 not so very long ago tony sanchez was just a fabulously wealthy businessman known in texas business and political circles but unknown to the voting public he fancied his thin mustache and wore aviator styled glasses he was supposedly a democrat but he also gave generously to george w bush the mustache is now gone and the glasses have been replaced by a more staid wire rimmed pair also gone is 538 million from mr sanchez 's fortune spent on a barrage of advertising as the democratic nominee for mr bush 's old job as governor if texas hardly knew tony sanchez before the state can not escape him now what do you say to those who say you are trying to buy the election a houston television anchor jerome gray asked mr sanchez on wednesday night in the candidates first debate televised across texas i 've had to do in a few months eight months what he has done in 17 years mr sanchez answered noting that his opponent gov rick perry is well known from a long tenure in politics mr sanchez who has never before run for office added i 've had to try to catch up in what has become one of the nastiest and most expensive governor 's races in the nation mr sanchez 59 by dint of his wallet and his presumed ethnic appeal is making republicans work hard to hold the office that vaulted mr bush to the presidency the advantages in republican leaning texas remain with mr perry the former lieutenant governor who inherited the top job from mr bush but polls suggest mr sanchez is gaining for the democrats who lost every statewide office in mr bush 's tenure the sanchez candidacy smacks of both inspiration and desperation democrats hope that mr sanchez 's spending will invigorate their ticket and that his mexican american heritage will attract a record turnout among the fast growing hispanic population if he wins mr sanchez would become the state 's first modern day hispanic governor he has been closing the gap day by day said molly beth malcolm chairwoman of the state democratic party a survey usa statewide tracking poll found that mr perry 's lead fell from 16 percentage points on july 12 to 7 points last week the sanchez campaign has released a poll showing the difference at 3 points while perry aides say the margin is safely in double digits the dynamics of the raceseem turned upside down it is the democrat mr sanchez who is running a big spending campaign as an outsider and a businessman criticizing mr perry as a career politician beholden to lobbyists and industry it is the republican mr perry who boasts of long experience as an elected official in the debate mr perry repeated the word experience so many times that scattered snickers rose from the audience but the biggest difference by far is the money republicans usually outspend democrats in texas in statewide races in 1998 governor bush outspent his democratic opponent about 17 to 1 in cruising to re election including about 3 million in contributions from others mr sanchez spent 575 million through sept 26 the deadline for the latest filing period compared with 163 million for mr perry as a result mr sanchez by himself has already broken the state 's spending record of 534 million for the governor 's campaign set by the combined campaigns of seven candidates in 1990 he is now spending roughly 1 million a week on television advertisements his campaign estimates that the average texas television viewer sees a sanchez commercial 8 to 10 times a week no small feat in a state with 18 television markets and nearly 21 million people it 's like nothing we 've ever experienced said susan weddington chairwoman of the texas republican party who accused the sanchez campaign of essentially co opting the democratic party just money everywhere trying to buy everything over all democrats are relishing this taste of affluence and say they believe the money can help them in other statewide races but some party members say the sanchez campaign despite its spending and television campaign has not yet energized its base hispanic vote hispanics represent more than a third of the state 's population but traditionally vote in far lower numbers one hispanic state legislator who spoke on condition of not being identified by name said mr sanchez was taking hispanic support for granted he is assuming that hispanics will vote for the hispanic and that is a good assumption if they vote at all said the legislator who is a democrat but since they do n't vote at all unless they are asked that 's his challenge he 's got to ask and he has n't asked yet mr sanchez a seventh generation texan from laredo who traces his lineage to mexico and spain is running as a business oriented moderate an oilman and banker mr sanchez is estimated to be worth 600 million and his campaign initially assumed that his business background would be a plus in texas but the collapse of the enron corporation and the attention on corporate malfeasance have undercut any advantage of campaigning as a chief executive mr perry has also pounded at a 1980 's scandal in which a savings and loan controlled by mr sanchez and his family accepted 25 million in cash from mexican men later identified as drug dealers ultimately the savings and loan failed costing taxpayers 161 million in a federal bailout in the debate mr sanchez noted that his bank was cleared of any wrongdoing involving the drug money and said that the institution 's overall failure came as more than 2500 savings and loan were also collapsing in texas mr perry also attacked mr sanchez over the fact that he did not vote in the last governor 's election mr sanchez conceded that that was a mistake throughout the debate mr sanchez repeated his main point that mr perry had done too little to address a home insurance crisis in the state hundreds of thousands of homeowners in texas which leads the nation in the cost of home insurance premiums are expected to lose their coverage in the next year and premiums will increase for many others mr sanchez said mr perry should have called a special legislative session to address the issue and accused him of failing to act because he has more than 1 million in campaign contributions from insurers mr bush has campaigned with mr perry but mr sanchez who contributed more than 300000 to mr bush 's campaigns has run commercials noting his own ties to the president the election is acutely important to both parties republicans would be horrified if they lost mr bush 's old job democrats have focused on this election cycle for two years and assembled

 a jury in federal court convicted a boston investment firm and its lawyer today on racketeering bribery and obstruction of justice charges that included offering money and other benefits to connecticut 's former state treasurer in exchange for a 200 million pension fund contract the defendants were acquitted of other bribery charges the firm triumph capital and its general counsel charles b spadoni were each convicted on 8 counts of an 11 count indictment based largely on the testimony of its key witness paul j silvester the former state treasurer the government convinced jurors that the firm and mr spadoni had agreed to provide fake 1 million consulting jobs for lisa a thiesfield his campaign manager and mistress and christopher stack another friend of mr silvester 's in exchange for an increased investment in the state 's pension fund contract the jury also convicted the firm and mr spadoni on obstruction of justice for mr spadoni 's use of a computer program to destroy files after the fbi served his firm with a subpoena the jury did not convict on the government 's charge that the firm and mr spadoni had committed a 100000 campaign contribution to the state republican party intended for mr silvester mr silvester had testified that there was an implicit rather than an explicit understanding among him mr spadoni and the firm that the campaign contribution was offered in exchange for state work mr silvester whom gov john g rowland picked to fill a vacant treasurer 's job in 1997 and who appeared in the 1998 statewide republican ticket with a candidate for secretary of state who has since been indicted has been in prison since 2001 he said he testified in hopes of reducing his sentence during his two days of testimony he said that as sole arbiter for awarding millions of dollars of state money he entered or tried to enter into illegal quid pro quo arrangements with triumph and four other private investment companies seeking business with the state at times mr silvester 's testimony read like a catalog of political and business luminaries who he said received finder 's fees or were selected for state work for example mr silvester said he was considering investing with the apollo real estate investment fund when pat mccabe a hartford lobbyist and jerome wilson a former new york state senator told him that the apollo fund manager william mack would hold a fund raiser in 1998 for governor rowland if the state invested with apollo mr silvester agreed and shortly afterward mr mack raised 50000 at a fund raiser for the governor on another occasion mr silvester said he selected an investment firm pioneer capital although he was dubious of its merits because it was favored by the governor he described a decision to increase the state 's investment in pioneer after some of his treasury department employees and campaign staff got state jobs although the governor directly turned down his request for the jobs through a spokesman the governor has denied asking anyone to speak to mr silvester mr silvester testified that he invested in the carlyle group in exchange for a finder 's fee for wayne e berman once a top republican fund raiser in washington from whom he sought a job mr berman has said the fee was legal he also testified that william a dibella a former democratic state senator received a finder 's fee in exchange for a state investment in thayer capital a washington investment firm according to mr silvester who arranged for the fee with frederic v malek a company executive mr malek was an official in a series of republican presidential administrations hugh keefe mr dibella 's lawyer said his client did nothing wrong although mr silvester has pleaded guilty to illegal dealings with five investment companies the only firm the government has pursued is triumph mr spadoni will be sentenced oct 3

 hipolito mejia 's path to the dominican presidency was cleared of its last obstacle today when his opponent from the governing party declined to seek a runoff averting what he said could be a prolonged and costly electoral crisis with virtually all the votes tallied mr mejia the candidate of the dominican revolutionary party was first with 4987 percent danilo medina of the ruling dominican liberation party was second with 2494 percent and joaquin balaguer the blind nonagenarian and seven time former president had 246 percent at an early morning news conference mr medina said that while it was clear to him that mr mejia had not won an outright majority a june 30 runoff would have cost too much in time money and tension adding that a continued campaign would have hurt the economy although his announcement was praised by some as an elegant exit it drew jeers from party militants who heckled him with shouts of traitor and repeated cries for a runoff leaders of the dominican liberation party or pld said their decision came after mr balaguer had warned them on wednesday night that he could not guarantee that all members of his social christian reformist party would support mr medina in the runoff the absence of a solid alliance would have guaranteed a victory for the dominican revolutionary party or prd the program of the pld is for the general good of the country and not for our organization 's or any individual 's interest mr medina said the leaders of our party decided not to create problems in the dominican republic and acknowledge the victory of the prd although the electoral council still needs several more days to certify the election formally mr medina 's departure from the race sets the stage for mr mejia 's inauguration on aug 16 when he and his vice president milagros ortiz bosch take office they will preside over an economy whose phenomenal growth presents them with the challenge of providing improved social services to the thousands of dominicans who supported them befitting his background in agriculture and past service as minister of agriculture mr mejia said he would find ways to help farmers who have been hurt by the privatization of state run enterprises in sugar production and the nearly fourfold increase in food imports since 1996 ms ortiz bosch said their administration would have to spur housing construction as well as improve delivery of electricity and water all part of their vow to provide better opportunities to the vast majority of residents who have not benefited from the robust economy this country needs 750000 units of new housing we have a deteriorated health system and social security covers only 6 percent of the population she said apart from economic growth we have not had economic development in a departure from the country 's history of acrimonious relations with haiti its impoverished neighbor ms ortiz bosch said their administration would seek to help it enlisting the support of the international community she raised the possibility of relocating assembly plants to the border and easing travel rules to allow haitians to come in and work for the day the new government 's ability to fulfill those promises will be closely watched although improving the circumstances of older residents who have been on the economic margins for decades could prove difficult this is a fairly affluent country yet you still have a terribly high level of social debt that has to be paid on education and other programs a diplomat said how do you deal with those workers who are between 25 and 45 years old a large number of semiliterate people who do not have many skills in any country it 's hard to include people who were left out in the past during a rapidly changing economy members of several delegations of observers said that despite the cumbersome electoral process which included long waits and numerous double checks of voter cards and lists to prevent corruption the vote was carried out smoothly and fairly to some extent the absence of major problems reflected the country 's economic good times said bernardo vega a former dominican ambassador to the united states today a service economy dependent on tourism business and an assembly sector that can leave the country and relocate elsewhere produces and economic model that implicitly needs political stability he said these elections reflected that
 it was just a routine roll call said the generals reassuringly a showy late night deployment last week of nearly 100 tanks around the presidential palace inside indonesia 's top military men were saluting their commander in chief president abdurrahman wahid and respectfully declining to carry out his order to impose a state of emergency so that he could cling to office it was an act of insubordination that underscored the political power of the indonesian military but nobody seemed to mind suddenly one of the country 's most unpopular institutions was the hero of the day now a big surprise the military has become the darling of democracy said salim said an expert on the armed forces an interesting view indonesia 's military is the overmuscled giant in the room and it is used to having things its way it ran the country for 32 years under former president suharto not just security affairs but politics government the bureaucracy it was mr suharto 's instrument of repression and terror until his ouster three years ago now people want it out and it has promised to withdraw from politics so democracy really can flourish that promise will be tested now with the inauguration this week of a new president megawati sukarnoputri who is a friend of the military and does not share the reformist ideals of her predecessor mr wahid in the most dire prediction put forward by mr wahid himself she will become its puppet and military influence in indonesia will be more unchecked than ever military leaders robustly deny this saying that the military has learned its lesson and that it really wants to become a professional nonpolitical organization at the service of its civilian commander it has been our commitment to leave the political arena and we are preparing a new paradigm that is different from our behavior in the past said gen graito husodo the chief spokesman for the armed forces in an interview we know we must change we have no other choice but to change if we do n't change we die but he added a significant caveat it 's not about changing our culture overnight he said especially a culture that has been shaped over the past 32 years most independent analysts of the military here agree with this as a broad generalization but they too add a caveat saying there are many steps to be taken on the road to reform many differences over the pace and nature of change and many serious obstacles that will take years to address rather than seeing mrs megawati as a puppet these analysts say it might be more accurate to say there is a wide meeting of the minds with more of the actual thinking perhaps done by the soldiers there has been an implicit alliance between them for more than a year a western diplomat said there is little question that the military has been out to get wahid the new president is not seen as a stickler for civil liberties and she is expected to welcome the military 's eagerness to use aggressive tactics to quell separatist movements and other disturbances most political analysts do not expect her to press forward very hard with prosecutions of officers implicated in an array of human rights abuses like those committed in east timor when it gained its independence in 1999 she may be influenced by them but saying she will come under their domination is too strong said harold crouch an expert on the indonesian military with the international crisis group a policy institute she will probably allow them a freer hand in what they would see as their own field security matters whether the screws will be tightened to the point of reinstituting press restrictions harassing public interest groups and limiting political expression and whether such steps could be blamed on the military are questions raising concern among many indonesians today such possible steps might depend on the perception of the military and the power structure of the degree of threat they see to their control there is also an old guard within the military that is reluctant to cede the wealth and power that came with political dominance and that argues that civilians are not yet capable of running the country the ineptness of mr wahid 's administration only strengthened that argument i keep telling my friends that at the end of the day the important thing is not whether the military role is reduced but how to increase the civilian capacity for good leadership said juwono sudarsono a former defense minister whatever happens it would take some doing to go back to the pervasive military role of the past significant and possibly irreversible changes have already taken place the army 's roles in security and politics have been formally ended no longer is the military in charge of the political system and government bureaucracy no longer does it have the power to examine and reject party leaders and electoral candidates active officers can no longer populate the government power structure as they have for decades as provincial and local administrators government ministers and ambassadors and the formal inclusion of the armed forces as a voting bloc in the upper and lower houses of parliament has been reduced in number and is due to be phased out entirely in the next few years one of the stumbling blocks to reform is the maintenance of a structure that operates parallel to the civilian bureaucracy and often wields more power the military argues that the nation is still too unstable for it to pull its forces out of the provinces entirely more important the territorial commands provide as much as 70 percent of the military 's operating budget through legal and illegal businesses extortion rackets and control of logging and mining operations another issue is the lack of professionalism of many of the troops on the ground which top officers concede undertrained underpaid often poorly commanded local units sometimes run wild one more criminal element in an unstable society repairing the reputation of the military both at the level of national politics and in remote provinces may be as difficult a challenge as more substantive reforms but by challenging it with his threat to impose an emergency mr wahid may have given the military its biggest public relations lift in years
 morgan stanley is expected to settle a complaint by the securities and exchange commission as early as today according to people who have been briefed on the investigation the complaint asserts that the firm did not disclose improper payments from investment companies for selling their mutual funds these people said yesterday as part of a settlement morgan stanley is expected to pay a fine of around 50 million these people said the sec is expected to assert that brokers at morgan stanley through its partners program received financial incentives to sell the mutual funds of the investment companies which would then direct brokerage business to morgan stanley neither the payments by fund companies nor the extra compensation paid by morgan stanley to its brokers was sufficiently disclosed the agency is expected to claim a morgan stanley spokeswoman declined to comment sec officials did not return messages the sec informed morgan stanley of its investigation in september when it sent the firm a notice saying the agency was considering an enforcement action because of a lack of disclosure on the brokers payment arrangements according to filings companies practice of paying a broker via commissions to sell mutual funds called paying for shelf space is an industry norm but the sec is said to have been concerned that morgan stanley was paying its brokers extra to participate in this practice and not disclosing it as part of the program as many as 14 fund companies would get preferred access to morgan stanley 's distribution network the firm would pay its brokers additional commissions for selling the preferred funds as opposed to nondesignated funds the sec is expected to say

 the accounting firm ernst young announced yesterday that it would stop selling information technology services to companies it audits and that it would no longer serve as internal accountant and external auditor at the same company the move by ernst young comes as several competitors are announcing new limits on the range of services they will provide to a client on sunday arthur andersen the accounting firm that audited the enron corporation announced that it was creating a special oversight board with broad powers to change how the firm does business kpmg and pricewaterhousecoopers both announced last week that they would support similar changes ernst young 's announcement leaves deloitte touche as the only big five accounting firm standing by the practice of providing consulting services to companies it audits in a statement last week deloitte acknowledged that its policy was perceived as a problem by investors but said the public interest would be served by lowering the level of hyperbole in the debate and carefully considering potential unintended consequences of any proposed reforms james s turley ernst young 's chief executive said in a conference call with reporters yesterday that it was important for the large accounting firms to adopt clear positions on the question of which services auditors can provide to clients investors regulators and lawmakers have been calling for a review of the many services accounting firms provide since the collapse of enron and its filing for bankruptcy protection enron 's auditor arthur andersen provided both consulting and audit services and also served at times as an internal and external auditor it 's obviously a challenging time for the profession mr turley said over the last few weeks it became very clear to me that several of us needed to stake out positions and just get on with things relative to the scope of services mr turley said he favored the creation of an independent disciplinary organization unrelated to the accounting industry 's trade association a proposal similar to one made last month by the chairman of the securities and exchange commission harvey l pitt but he also suggested that regulators create a crisis response team that would react to situations like enron 's bankruptcy filing by recommending rapid changes to accounting standards mr turley said that providing consulting services to companies audited by ernst young did not in fact create conflicts of interest and that a prohibition against doing so would probably not prevent an enron style implosion rather he said the public perception of a conflict had to be addressed in any event he said giving up technology consulting would not be a serious hardship because the firm sold its consulting business to cap gemini a european consulting firm in 2000 ernst young will however feel the effects of no longer serving as both internal and external accountants for its clients mr turley said from 20 to 25 clients receive both services and the internal audit work generates several hundred million dollars a year for the accounting firm ernst young would not disclose exactly how much it earns from clients where it is both internal and external auditor the firm could lose some clients when it changes its policies but it could just as easily pick up clients from other accounting firms making similar changes not to take such steps might keep the accounting industry from recovering its credibility mr turley warned that in turn could cause it to lose its best people the profession could become one where existing professionals do n't want to stay in it he said and students would not want to work as accountants the same concerns are behind an e mail message sent yesterday by james g castellano chairman of the american institute of certified public accountants to members of that organization mr castellano wrote that enron 's collapse has eroded our most important asset public confidence and reported that the association 's board had approved a resolution supporting measures similar to those adopted by ernst young andersen and others mr castellano also advised the group 's members that in the next few weeks the association would take out advertisements in national publications to try to restore confidence in the accounting profession and attract recruits the profession 's heightened visibility mr castellano wrote makes this an opportune time to convey our messages regarding its viability dynamism and high standards enron 's many strands accounting correction february 6 2002 wednesday an article in business day yesterday about efforts by the accounting firm ernst young to change some practices misstated part of its plans the firm did not say it would stop providing information technology services to companies it audits it has not provided such services since it sold its consulting business in 2000 ernst young does however support an industry proposal to prohibit accounting firms from selling consulting services to companies they audit

 the largest private landowner in the adirondacks in upstate new york international paper said yesterday that it had agreed to sell 26500 acres to the nature conservancy a private environmental group for 105 million in what would be one of the largest land preservation agreements in the state 's history the agreement is complex and people at some environmental groups said the virtues of the plan would emerge only in its details which are to be worked out in the coming months a portion of the land for example is to continue in active commercial use as timberland after the sale is completed the amount of land and its location remain to be worked out the purchase is to be completed within 90 days but state officials and leaders of the nature conservancy agreed that at a minimum the sale would protect in perpetuity a chain of undeveloped lakes and ponds that are considered jewels within the wilderness section of adirondack park and the commercial logging that does occur will be overseen by the state we wanted to find a way to satisfy the public interest in these lands but also maintain a commercial working forest because we think that 's important too said robert stegemann a spokesman for international paper gov george e pataki said in an interview that the agreement was unprecedented partly because of the size of the tracts involved but also because it would complete what he said has been an environmental dream of the state since at least 1997 when new york bought an adjoining 15000 acre tract in that case the seller was the whitney family inheritors of the fortune of william c whitney the industrialist who purchased tens of thousands of acres of upstate land in the 1800 's officials at the nature conservancy said the agreement would cover a backwoods canoeing trail that had been concentrated in the whitney section ever since its sale but which would now extend into international paper land as well mr pataki stressed that while preservation was the state 's first goal encouraging sustainable economic activity in the adirondacks was crucial as well he said managed logging and increased tourism on the newly opened wilderness lands would provide economic stimulus to neighboring towns new york state has been acquiring land in the rugged north country of the adirondacks for more than a century the result is a sprawling wilderness that many environmentalists have called one of the nation 's last great wild places adirondack park itself now includes six million acres making it the largest public park in the lower 48 states a spokesman for the adirondack council a private environmental group that focuses on the park region said the agreement was tremendous news but the spokesman john f sheehan said there were still concerns because so many details especially how the land would be managed remained unsettled we would have liked to see it all become wilderness mr sheehan said but at the very least it will be preserved from development and the commercial operations will be overseen by the state he said his group would be an active participant in negotiations about long term management of the land the state director for the nature conservancy henry tepper said the delicate balancing of interests was the hallmark of the agreement he said that while the nature conservancy had bought other smaller parcels for protection while agreeing to their continued commercial use the latest deal was by far the largest of its kind in new york this agreement simultaneously maintains a managed forest landscape conserves ecological resources and supports the local economy he said most of the land is in hamilton county in the town of long lake the land is clustered in three large parcels that contain four large lakes more than 12 smaller ponds over 4000 acres of pristine wetlands 85 miles of rivers and streams and a rare section of spruce and fir forest mr pataki and the officials at the nature conservancy said however that the extension of what had been a well established canoe route through this area of adirondack park was what gave the land much of its recreational appeal little tupper lake in particular will connect to the bog river and tupper lake round lake and loon pond two large remote lakes in a section adjoining the whitney parcel will also greatly expand the canoeing network they said
 with mortgage rates matching their lowest levels in more than 30 years thousands of americans are rushing to refinance the loans on their homes but the lift to the economy that usually comes when homeowners negotiate a better mortgage deal is unlikely to be as great this time as in the past the falling rates dropping to 654 percent on average last week for a 30 year mortgage are indeed a prop for the wavering economy with loans so cheap home sales and home construction are booming those who refinance to raise cash also strengthen an economy dependent on consumer spending and in the new rush to refinance the majority of households are doing just that but many homeowners who might have refinanced their mortgages now did so last fall when rates also fell just as low for a few weeks the pool of people who missed that window is relatively small mortgage lenders say in addition a growing number of households are using the lower rates to shrink 30 year mortgages to 15 or 20 years for about the same monthly payments the economy gets no stimulus when a homeowner does this instead of using lower rates to decrease monthly payments and increase consumer spending the economy as a result is not likely to get the same kick from this round of refinancing as it did last fall when interest rates fell in the aftermath of sept 11 then people with 7 percent mortgages rushed to refinance at 65 percent and the tendency to shorten a mortgage 's maturity rather than to refinance was not as common the people most sensitive to interest rate changes refinanced last fall said sterling edmunds jr the president of suntrust mortgage a nationwide lender headquartered in richmond va and for them to do it again the 30 year rate would have to fall another half a percentage point not since the 1960 's have rates on 30 year mortgages fallen that extra half point to 6 percent or less the increasing popularity of shorter mortgages is apparent in the 11 offices of mortgageamerica which operates in florida alabama and georgia john b johnson the chief executive attributes the trend to a growing desire among cautious americans to be debt free by their late 50 's there is an absence today of more profitable investments than homeownership itself he said and people realize this the strongest reason for refinancing is still to get lower monthly payments mr johnson said but we are seeing significant numbers of people refinancing to shorter maturities while leaving their payments unchanged more than last fall for mr edmunds 's suntrust the flow of refinancing activity while up sharply from early spring is still running 25 percent below last fall 's peak of 4 billion in new mortgages in october or as dorothy lubbes the mortgage officer at southern commercial bank in st louis said i have lots of appointments and i am extremely busy through the day but i am not putting in the extra hours that i put in last fall it has not gotten to that point yet the window of opportunity last fall stayed open only a few weeks rates reached their low point in the second week of november then bounced back to roughly 7 percent by year end and stayed there until may when the current fall began accelerating last week through each episode stock prices also plunged displaying a grim relationship falling stock prices it turns out have become a principal reason why in this business cycle long term interest rates including mortgage rates are also falling in this respect the two have become wrapped in a strange embrace that has made the flight from stocks an unexpected source of strength for consumer spending mainly through mortgage refinancing in a recovery stock prices and interest rates usually rise together but this time they are falling together it suggests that if you get a rally in stocks you will get a setback in mortgage rates said henry kaufman the wall street economist and consultant we are caught in a recovery that helps people and hurts them at the same time fear seems to make this unusual mechanism work displaying more fear of stocks than at any time since the 1980 's investors are shifting their money to what they consider safe investments mainly 10 year treasury notes and mortgage backed bonds treasuries are guaranteed by the federal government and mortgage backed bonds have homes as collateral as the demand rises for both these types of bonds their rates fall and so do the associated rates for household mortgages the stock market is not alone of course in pulling down long term rates a weak economy has convinced many investors that the recovery from last year 's recession will take longer than originally anticipated and the federal reserve will not even consider raising rates until late this year at the earliest as recently as may forecasters had expected the fed to have raised rates by now to control inflation but in the weak economy inflation has been dormant a bit of gloom and doom has developed about where the economy is going and that weighs on rates said lyle e gramley a senior economic adviser to schwab capital markets clearly it weighs on the 30 year mortgage rate which edged down to 654 percent last week from 657 percent the week before according to freddie mac the government sponsored mortgage agency the 654 percent matched last november 's low of 645 percent after including the additional points charged in the fall as a refinancing fee freddie mac bases its average rate on a weekly survey of mortgage lenders its average rate last week also matched another post 1960 's low in early october of 1998 when a surge in refinancing helped to lift the economy during a growing global financial crisis stock prices fell then too as investors shifted their money to what they considered safer investments now in the latest round of mortgage refinancing many homeowners are reducing their payments by significant amounts some customers at southern commercial for example have cut up to 80 from each monthly installment on an 80000 mortgage the second most popular option has been to keep the monthly payments unchanged but borrow more thus tapping the rising value of homes when prices are rising so quickly that some experts say a bubble has developed alan greenspan the chairman of the federal reserve rejects that concern in congressional testimony he has argued that the housing market does not lend itself easily to bubbles because home prices vary by region and homeowners do not buy and sell quickly as stockholders do fed policy makers argue that even before the latest refinancing boom homeowners who sold diverted some of their windfall profits to consumer spending and that dynamic continues to provide crucial support for the recovery the fed is supporting every dimension of the housing market said albert m wojnilower a wall street economist in principle if stock prices keep dropping there is no reason why the rate on 30 year mortgages should not go below 6 percent

 a panel of experts appointed by schools chancellor harold o levy has recommended that a more demanding high school math curriculum be created for students who want it because it said current programs geared to state standards are not rigorous enough to meet the needs of thousands of college bound students the recommendation in a 52 page report released yesterday would restore a two track system just as the state board of regents has begun abolishing the old two track system beginning this spring all students who started ninth grade four years ago will be required to pass a state regents examination in math before they can graduate from high school the regents driven city and state math curriculum for all students leaves the most advanced ones as much as three years behind where they should be the panel said if they want to be ready for college level math science architecture nursing and even law which requires analytical thinking while the regents contend that the new graduation tests raise standards for everyone the panel gave the current math curriculum only a lukewarm endorsement calling it adequate for the time being the panel urged city schools to give college bound students in grades 9 through 11 the choice of a more traditional approach to math involving an emphasis on abstract thinking and mastery of standard mathematical rules known as algorithms more than half the 1100 city schools use a different approach called constructivism which encourages students to discover how to solve problems on their own rather than depending on formulas the content and scope of these courses should emphasize more extensively and in greater depth the logical formal and abstract aspects of mathematics the report found although buried in the jargon filled text of the report this particular section appears to be a cautiously worded critique of constructivist math which encourages students to rediscover centuries old mathematical principles for themselves using materials like beans and calculators to add fractions students taught by the constructivist approach might fold paper strips rather than reduce the numbers to the lowest common denominator at a news conference yesterday at board of education headquarters in brooklyn where the report was released mr levy said that he would follow up on the recommendation for an advanced track although aides said later that the new system would not necessarily be ready by this fall mr levy suggested that a two track option would provide an alternative to constructivist math without dictating curriculum and teaching methods he emphasized that it would be available to any student who was interested one shoe fits all for all students did not seem to me totally appropriate mr levy said alan ray a spokesman for the state education commissioner richard p mills said mr mills had no objection to advanced courses the regents requirements are supposed to be a floor not a ceiling he said adding that mr mills believed that they were an improvement over the graduation requirements of the past the panel started working in october matthew goldstein chancellor of the city university of new york was the chairman mr levy focused on pressing the case for more qualified math teachers a recommendation that had been included in a draft of the report that was released in april recruiting more qualified teachers of all kinds and paying them better have been mr levy 's top priorities the report blamed teachers inadequate training for city students low scores in math only 22 percent of city eighth graders passed last year 's state math test but 40 percent passed statewide the report did not provide statistics or even anecdotal evidence to support its contention that many math teachers are underqualified mr levy said the panel members did not visit classrooms the report was prepared by analyzing documents and talking to teachers his office later released statistics showing that 81 percent of math teachers in high school and 64 percent in junior high meet state certification standards some of the city 's most vocal critics of constructivist math said yesterday that they doubted that a two track program could be carried out fairly how will we select which children in high school are eligible for the reform said elizabeth carson a leader of that opposition and the mother of an eighth grade boy she said it was racist it is classist it is appalling not to give all students the best courses
 poland 's political future became murkier today with more complete tallies from the election on sunday indicating that the clear victors the democratic left alliance of former communists will not be able to control parliament without a partner likely to make demands that could slow entry into the european union and to slash the budget deficit the democratic left is likely to have to strike at least an informal alliance if not an outright coalition with one of the right wing peasant parties whose overall strength in the elections showed the depth of discontent among poland 's peasant farmers over the agricultural reforms that would be necessary to gain membership in the union over all an electorate fearful of the future 16 percent unemployment and a growing budget deficit showed clear disillusionment with the results of just over a decade of democracy and capitalism turnout was low 46 percent and a huge majority of the votes actually cast went either to the former communists considered likely to keep afloat at least some deficit ridden state enterprises or to parties with a nostalgic vision of the peasant poland of old a strong roman catholic strain or a pronounced hankering for law and order the only bright spot for poland 's new urban middle class was the second place finish of a new pro business party civic platform led by defectors from several other major parties they received almost 13 percent of the vote eclipsing the established pro market forces around leszek balcerowicz whose party posted only 3 percent on sunday and will not sit in parliament civic platform supports budget cuts and the european union but its strong business constituency and staunch laissez faire views would make it a difficult partner for the democratic left partial but official election results issued this morning showed that the democratic left was the landslide winner but the alliance led by leszek miller received only 41 percent of the vote compared with earlier estimates of 44 percent and could be 12 seats short of a parliamentary majority mr miller 's most likely partner is the polish peasants party which took 89 percent of the vote and was the democratic left 's partner in a rather unhappy coalition from 1993 to 1997 the peasants party is opposed to the european union but less militantly so than the samoobrona or self defense party of angry farmers which garnered 10 percent mr miller gave no public hint of who he would tap as partner saying he preferred to wait for complete results on tuesday samoobrona and its leader andrzej lepper made their name by setting up highway blockades to protest the government 's farm policies two other right wing parties will enter parliament one is law and justice a new party focused heavily on attacking corruption and street crime election results indicated that it received 94 percent of the vote the other is the league of polish families a group with xenophobic leanings that campaigned on the slogan so that poland can be poland and took 76 percent the demise of solidarity was complete with 56 percent of the vote it will not get into parliament

 even if as the beach boys sang everybody did have an ocean across the usa they still might not be surfin like californ eye ay as any novice can attest it 's at least as hard as it looks but this summer 's fashionable beachcombers will be wearing their baggies and their archie sandals too just like the guys on the water the surf fashion trend that has been growing in recent years has become well a huge wave that is already breaking over department stores soho shops and other outlets to visit any big men 's wear department for example to step off the elevator on the second floor at macy 's herald square is to wade into fashion 's north shore of oahu tommy hilfiger has traded in his house on cape cod for a little grass shack turning his display area into a nylon rain forest hilfiger was ridiculed early on by surfers for sewing mesh briefs into its board shorts but the label has learned its lesson and has come back strong with some classic designs at ralph lauren there are wildly colored board shorts that may never get wet unless it rains and tank tops t shirts in every conceivable surf related pattern hang on racks shaped like surfboards surf and tropical is by far the no 1 summer trend said joseph dinofrio macy 's vice president for fashion we started seeing little tastes of it last year and now there 's a full head on it mr dinofrio said the popularity of flowery surf patterns was probably a reaction to the racing stripes that predominated in the late 1990 's and the rise of board shorts cut baggy and long for freedom of movement and protection against chafing may be an outgrowth of pop fashion 's long and baggy trend manifested in cargo and basketball shorts down in soho quicksilver an authentic surf brand based in california has opened a shop on spring street the metal handles on the shop doors are shaped like a pair of miniature surfboards so trendy rippers expert surfers have to grab a rail the edge of a surfboard just to check out the hawaiian shirts and hooded sweatshirts for surfer girls there are jeans camisoles and floral print bikinis by the company 's roxy label quicksilver 's labels say its products are used by real surfers that might be enough to make real real surfers cry it would be easy even understandable for them to sneer at the towel potatoes on the beach tricked out in their rip curl shorts sideburns and dragon shades but it may be that real surfers could n't care less what other people on the beach are wearing we all love the beach and we all love the ocean for different reasons said george browne 50 of bayville nj who has been surfing since 1968 i happen to love the ocean to catch waves and the people who want to look like us that 's fine mr browne who surfs mainly in lavallette nj easily qualifies as a soul surfer a veteran with a boundless love of surfing as well as respect for the beauty and power of the ocean itself mr browne is a long boarder that is he rides a board measuring nine feet or more which offers a more mellow ride a long board is also more effective in small surf than so called short boards of seven feet or less which are generally nimbler and faster and are generally preferred by brash young types in between there are so called fun boards mr brown 's 19 year old son phil is a semiprofessional surfer who flies to places like hawaii tahiti and this month barbados in pursuit of the perfect wave he strives not so much to place high in competitions but to be photographed in ideal settings by photographers eager to publish this delights him and his sponsor billabong because it helps the company sell board shorts and t shirts surfing has been a part of american pop culture since the 1960 's when california bands recorded hits harmonizing over borrowed chuck berry guitar riffs and bruce brown released his quintessential surf film the endless summer these days the pursuit of a good wave takes place on the jersey shore from sandy hook to cape may and on long island to the tip of montauk new york city itself has surfing on rockaway beach you can take a subway to surf said eron bloomgarden 25 of manhattan an internet marketing specialist for ibm who surfs the net at work then heads for the real thing on long island at long beach lido beach and gilgo the surfrider foundation an environmental group made up mostly of surfers has been among the leading opponents of ocean dumping off sandy hook it has also successfully fought surfing bans at municipal beaches on the jersey shore in deal ortley beach point pleasant and elsewhere people do get connected to the environment via articles in surfer magazines said kristin milligan 29 of south belmar nj a marine biologist with the clean ocean action environmental group who builds her own surfboards then again she added a lot of surfers are some of the least environmentally aware people i 've ever seen i mean they trash the beach like their surf wax it comes in plastic and they leave that plastic on the beach dr milligan is both a serious environmentalist who sits on the surfrider foundation 's environmental issues team and part surfer girl working the jersey shore with a group of about 30 women known as the ocean divas a lot of real surfers i know take real pleasure in wearing surf clothes ms milligan said when we get together the girls like to talk about that kind of stuff no one is really sure how many people are out there catching waves but a possible indicator of the sport 's increasing popularity is the growth of the surfrider foundation which was founded in 1984 in malibu the number of chapters has grown from 10 in 1992 to 48 currently including chapters in new jersey in montauk and as of december in new york city the foundation 's 25000 dues paying members include 1554 in new jersey and 1287 in new york state the organization 's president christopher j evans is a native of huntington on long island and its chapter operations director edward mazzarella was born in west islip there as far as our growth and awareness i think it 's related to growth in the surf industry mr mazzarella said and the whole image mr bloomgarten the new york city surfer took up the sport five years ago after being transfixed by surfers on the north shore he is now the chief organizer of surfriders new york city chapter mr bloomgarten admitted that he himself was first attracted by the surfer image as much as by the sport while he eventually ended up putting his board shorts to real use he has no problem with the likelihood that most people never will saying you do n't need to do the sport to achieve the look

 william hanna of hanna barbera fame brought the world the jetsons the cartoon family that whizzed through rush hour on a skyway and kept robot friends mr hanna 's son david plans today to introduce a more attainable vision of the future david hanna is the chief executive of tropos networks inc which has equipped a one square mile area in downtown half moon bay a northern california coastal town with a network technology that gives mobile computer users internet access the deployment of wireless internet access is primarily through hot spots or single points of access at places like coffee shops the locations are equipped with technology popularly known as wi fi in which data is sent over a radio frequency but a big challenge with the technology is that it typically does not travel very far and can be interfered with relatively easily the tropos concept is to build blanket coverage that provides uninterrupted service for an entire geographic area in half moon bay the company has deployed 8 to 10 wi fi hot spots equipped with technology that enables them to communicate with one another two of the hot spots have land line connections to carry the data to the internet backbone the tropos service offered through a local internet access provider coastside net inc charges 495 an hour to give customers access to the internet anywhere within the district company officials said mr hanna said that within the last month the company also deployed its technology for use by police departments in san mateo calif and boulder city nev tropos said the systems were designed to give police officers access to data over high speed networks as they drive around the city several cities have experimented with providing wi fi service to the public said craig j mathias an analyst with farpoint group an ashland mass telecommunications consulting firm he called the tropos technology a very interesting approach i expect them to get a lot of interest mr mathias said mr mathias said the technology bears some similarities to an approach generally known as a mesh network which allows data to move among hot spots before being routed to the internet he said it would take superior marketing as well as effective technology to succeed in this market the ability to get the word out is going to play a big role mr mathias said in that vein mr hanna is seeking to market tropos first as a way to address law enforcement and antiterrorism issues we think this is going to be the tail wind that drives networks and applications he said
 amid the current carnage in technology shares nuance communications is one of the last great story stocks nuance a leading developer of advanced speech recognition software able to recognize and respond to human voices is tapping into a market that many technology analysts say they believe is potentially enormous big companies which spend tens of billions of dollars annually on call centers to take orders and provide customer support increasingly rely on speech recognition not just to handle requests for information but to process customer orders at fidelity investments the boston mutual fund giant almost 5 percent of its customers now use computerized voice recognition for trades and the company expects that fraction to climb said jim taylor fidelity 's senior vice president for retail phone operations automated call centers are only the most obvious way speech recognition will be used the software is now becoming sophisticated enough to identify speakers through voiceprints akin to fingerprints eventually reducing the need for personal identification numbers within a few years many analysts say the standard telephone dial tone will be replaced by internet enabled telecommunications systems that understand human voices and can connect to both other phones and web sites ultimately you can imagine a day when you pick up the phone and instead of hearing a dial tone you hear 'how can i help you said graham smith nuance 's chief financial officer we obviously think the market is pretty huge until a couple of weeks ago investors seemed to agree between april when nuance based in menlo park calif first sold shares to the public and early november the company 's shares rose almost seven fold that gain gave nuance which has lost about 18 million so far this year a market valuation of almost 4 billion about 100 times its trailing annual sales even by the loose standards of last winter that ratio was extraordinarily high now nuance is suffering its own mini crash as investors once again learn that great stories do not always make great companies or great stocks since nov 8 nuance shares have dropped from 11581 to 3225 a withering 72 percent plunge any highflier has just gotten knocked down and they were definitely a highflier said brian ruttenbur an analyst at morgan keegan a regional securities firm based in memphis last wednesday when nuance 's stock stood at 54 mr ruttenbur decided that the company 's shares had bottomed and become a bargain he raised his rating from market perform to outperform i thought it was settling out he said instead i became a javelin catcher nuance may not be through spearing unwary investors according to short sellers who think the company remains overvalued despite its steep decline short sellers sell stock they have borrowed hoping to buy it back later when its price has fallen the shorts argue that the market for speech recognition software is likely to develop more slowly than nuance 's boosters hope they point to a report earlier this year from frost sullivan which predicts that the overall speech software market will be only 700 million in 2006 up from about 100 million last year in addition they note that nuance 's domestic sales dropped from the second quarter to the third quarter though its overall sales rose about 20 percent to 144 million more important when the market does mature the skeptics argue nuance will get only a tiny fraction of it because its software is a commodity that is the least valuable part of the recognition business the hardware provided by companies like ibm and nortel networks and the application software that guides customers through a menu of choices are far more important they say there is a serious discrepancy in the marketplace said manuel asensio who has sold nuance shares short it 's one of those triple digit multibillion wonders that when it gets to be under 500 million people will go 'gee who would have thunk mr asensio also complained that in september only five months after the company 's initial public offering nuance executives sold more than 17 million shares of stock which at the time were valued at more than 210 million executives will be able to sell another 19 million shares of stock in december when a lockup expires nortel which uses nuance 's software in the call centers it sets up for corporations and is nuance 's largest customer plays down nuance 's role in its products it 's three  or four layer cake here and they 're down in the infrastructure said marty dixon who directs customer interaction solutions for nortel which accounted for 29 percent of nuance 's sales in the first six months of 2000 ken holl senior product manager for advanced speech technology for nortel said nuance 's product was not very different from similar speech engines offered by royal philips electronics the giant dutch high technology conglomerate or speechworks a boston based competitor we have a very strong relationship with nuance but we also have a strong relationship with philips mr holl said they both support a good set of features the core technology all originated from the same source mr smith the nuance chief financial officer said that analysis was simplistic nuance 's software offers advantages over its competitors including better recognition over background noise like traffic he said in addition nuance 's software is able to simultaneously process thousands of conversations on a single network he said that scalability will be crucial for companies like sprint pcs as they replace dial tones with speech software ultimately scalablility becomes very important mr smith said after raising money from public investors twice in the last seven months nuance has enough cash to ride out a prolonged downturn that money gives it time to prove the value of its software but even after its three week skid nuance has a 1 billion market capitalization and trades at 25 times trailing revenues that valuation gives it plenty of room to drop correction december 8 2000 friday the market place column in business day on nov 29 about nuance communications a developer of speech recognition software referred incorrectly to the sale of 17 million shares by stockholders in september nuance executives sold 122000 shares and other stockholders including venture capitalists and members of nuance 's board sold the rest nuance executives did not sell the entire amount

titanium cards credit lines of as much as 100000 unlike most of us however mrs hamman 93 never sees them that is because she has been in an assisted living residence in homestead fla for more than a

5572 for 48 months that means that she would repay 267456 which translates to an annual interest rate of 31945 percent more than four times the prime rate if this check had fallen into her hands it 's entirely conceivable that she might have used it and not really known what she was doing mr hamman said celeste murphy director of investor relations at household international which is based in prospect heights ill said her company did not specifically single out older people for such solicitations she agreed that the 31945 percent rate offered mrs hamman was stunning mr hamman was also puzzled that many of the offers cited his mother 's excellent credit history as a reason for offering her up to 100000 of credit she does n't have any credit he said she has no assets other than her pension and social security and has n't owned a home since the 1960 's either there is a credit report mix up or this is the biggest bunch of hooey i 've ever seen a spokeswoman in washington for the american bankers association a lobbying group said that members look at creditworthiness before making credit card offers mrs hamman grew up in oklahoma and during world war ii was a lieutenant in the women 's army corps serving in italy and algeria she later worked in indiana as a consumer education agent and as a food editor at the evansville courier after retiring she served in the peace corps in belize for two years she 's always been a very independent person who stood up for folks who could n't stand up for themselves mr hamman said these credit offers would upset her because of the damage they can do to people who are n't financially sophisticated the seemingly personal solicitations can also prove seductive to the psychologically vulnerable mrs hamman is lucky that she has her son to look out for her in these matters many older people who are on their own especially if they are homebound lonely or confused can easily fall victim to such practices that while not illegal are certainly questionable travis b plunkett the legislative director of the consumer federation of america based in washington said indiscriminate and reckless marketing had become the rule in the credit card industry which last year mailed out a record 35 billion solicitations while members of this industry are asking congress to make bankruptcy more restrictive they have actually increased their solicitations and lines of credit he said referring to a bill pending in congress that would make it harder for people to erase their debts their business model the way they profit is to make risky loans to people who often do n't have the financial skills to know whether it 's right or not he added they 'll give a credit card to anything that moves consider the case involving the late doug x ping doug was a shar pei who was struck by a car and killed in 1994 when he was 5 the dog 's brooklyn owner who had brought him to the united states from china later put the pet 's name on some random consumer survey earlier this year doug received a solicitation from first usa bank in wilmington del for a national geographic society platinum mastercard with a solid line of credit of up to 100000 a spokesman for first usa bank which is a member of the banking association and a unit of bank one said we make every effort to ensure that the offers we mail out go to credit eligible adults if you 're not a dog you can take some steps to limit the number of mail solicitations you receive for a 5 fee the web site of the direct marketing association wwwthe dmaorg consumers allows you to remove your name from its members mailing lists the same service is free if you write to mail preference service direct marketing association po box 9008 farmingdale ny 11735 9008 there is also an automated toll free number 888 567 8688 that allows you to remove your name from mailed lists provided by the big credit reporting agencies but perhaps the best advice on dealing with credit solicitations comes from

 one morning last week my friend sherri and i went shopping in one of those unfamiliar neighborhoods where low slung anonymous warehouses have loading docks and blank windows we were looking for a wholesale restaurant supply store but all the winding streets looked interchangeable except for a few discreet signs like allied fastener corp and cubbies unlimited is n't this the third time we 've passed american pallet i asked as i turned left onto east industry court and look there 's window rama again sherri said we were lost in a light industrial zone this is a cautionary tale this is what can happen if you are the sort of disorganized person who plans a really big luncheon at your home to celebrate your daughter 's bat mitzvah then leaves all the details until the week before the party then blithely decides to run a zillion errands during the final harrowing days when you should be concentrating instead on moving the furniture to a neighbor 's garage i had hoped to buy all my last minute party supplies online without leaving my desk and certainly without wandering around the outer reaches of east industry court and to be fair if i had stuck to the original list i could have done a week 's work in one morning it took only a few hours in fact to knock off the first few items on my list 1 coffee i ordered five pounds from zabar 's wwwzabarscom for 598 a pound even though i skimped by choosing the cheapest shipping option the order arrived within 48 hours 2 beverages for kids in various non carpet staining colors a day after i placed the order wwwpeapod com delivered sprite ginger ale seltzer and other clear liquids at supermarket prices i paid a delivery fee of 395 discounted by 1 for a late evening delivery time during a specified two hour period so i did not have to carry 11 heavy plastic bags from the store to the car to the house delivery is a heftier 995 for orders under 75 3 florists supplies like wet foam 150 per brick and wire 99 cents for a 10 yard spool to make centerpieces i ordered from afloralcom with standard shipping they arrived in three business days 4 glow in the dark necklaces which i learned fall into a category known as glow novelties the jewelry comes in such child pleasing variants as earrings rings and even bunny ears after comparing the prices of such party purveyors as chemlite com glostickscom and epartyunlimitedcom i settled on wwwaccessoriespalacecom luckily i phoned to place the order the owner craig weil told me that the bracelet necklace combo sets three pack glowsticks were out of stock but after he checked with his supplier then called me back to say he could get them in time i placed an order for six boxes of 24 three packs at 15 a box and four dozen pairs of glowing earrings at 720 per dozen and to meet the site 's 75 per order minimum i asked him to throw in some eerie glow in the dark mouthpieces in assorted colors 780 per dozen that should be a real treat to see in action those early successes emboldened me especially after i realized that in a pinch i could even turn to amazon com for a 55 cup farberware stainless steel coffee urn 14999 or to bedbathandbeyondcom for the smaller 36 cup model 11999 i could even have a folding metal coat rack delivered to the door 109 at organize everythingcom here is where i went overboard item no 5 on my list said innocuously enough plastic or paper plates but although i quickly found big selections at such sites as www 1partysuppliesandfavorscom and 4yourpartycom and www birthdayexpresscom i could n't bring myself to buy them maybe it was the unappetizing descriptions like solid color partyware which did n't sound like something on which i would like to put food could i afford to use china instead it was a far more appetizing possibility but i had already priced and rejected the possibility of rental china which at about 60 cents a plate seemed too dear likewise rental flatware at 65 cents apiece but when i searched for restaurant suppliers online i found promising leads like acemartcom and gandgequipmentcom which listed real plates for sale at near rental prices the headquarters of one company premium supply was in deer park ny about a half hour drive from my house if i picked up the dishes myself i figured i could even avoid the shipping charges when i phoned the toll free number to inquire i learned that premium supply welcomed walk ins between 9 and 5 lucky too because its web site would not allow me to place an order online armed with door to door driving directions from mapquestcom sherri and i set off to find the dishes but now as i passed the midland manufacturing company yet again i was getting desperate try making a right at the next corner she said as we approached grand boulevard i did and suddenly as if in a dream premium supply appeared on the left inside the store was jampacked with aisles of merchandise like enormous whisks that would not be out of place in the land of the giants the sort of huge heavy duty cone shaped soup strainer you dream of when you are trying to remove the boiled out vegetables from stock and millions of the disposable cartons in which chinese takeout food gets packed but i learned that the selection featured online was very different from the actual merchandise in the store for instance the basic wide rimmed white china plates i sought were out of stock bad but it turned out that there were plenty of narrow rimmed plates fine and in one corner packed willy nilly in nondescript cardboard boxes that reached to the ceiling i rooted around the close out merchandise to find treasure a trove of simple white coffee cups that i could get for 52 cents apiece by the time my car was loaded with all the booty i had also scored cake plates for 576 cents apiece nice heavy forks for 36 cents apiece and matching spoons for 24 cents apiece sherri bought the fine mesh soup strainer 49 an item i expect to covet for the rest of my life then i drove past american pallet a few more times finally found the road to the highway and arrived home congratulating myself on having nine days left until the party with nothing to do but rearrange furniture and hire a band online shopper e mail slatalla nytimescom
 there are blackouts and then there are blackouts unlike unexpected power outages caused by bad weather the rolling blackouts in california have been planned and last no longer than two hours but regardless of the duration of interruption many of the precautions are the same if yours is a heavily computer dependent household you should consider investing in an uninterruptible power supply or two it may help you avoid some agony said jonathan cogan an energy information specialist at the energy information administration part of the federal department of energy if you 've lost two hours of work it may be worth the investment most large office supply and computer stores carry ups units and there are many brands to choose from apc and tripp lite make popular models equipment to plug into the power supply include computers and external disk drives and modems monitors especially cathode ray tube models draw a fair amount of power and so require a larger more expensive ups most power supplies for home use provide 10 to 20 minutes of backup power the more sophisticated and expensive units communicate with the computer on when to shut down and when the ups battery is waning if you depend heavily on your internet connection and can keep your computer going for a while on batteries it is wise to have a dial up connection on reserve which should remain up unless the outage affects your internet service provider cable modems and dsl connections will be lost generators are another matter they are tricky to install and use properly they can actually trip your whole power system up so that when the rest of the grid comes online there 's a surge and it can damage not only the generator but the wiring said claudia chandler assistant director of the california energy commission she recommended working with the local utility company when installing a generator generators which start at around 800 for a five kilowatt model also require gasoline or diesel fuel which can be dangerous to store although some models operate off of natural gas lines
 hoping to stem the purchase of fake police badges that could be used by terrorists representative anthony d weiner said yesterday that he would introduce a bill to restrict their sale nationwide new york state law prohibits the purchase of police badges real or fake by civilians although a bill passed in 2000 by congress made it a federal crime to sell replica badges across state lines they can still be legally purchased by someone wishing to use them for recreational purposes within the state where they are bought badges nearly identical to those worn by new york police department and new york state police lieutenants are available over the internet for 2995 those for higher ranking officials sell for about 80 the gleam of these fake badges is often enough to trick unknowing civilians each year the new york police department receives more than 1200 complaints about someone impersonating a police officer officials said there are people using fake badges to commit very real crimes mr weiner a democrat representing parts of brooklyn and queens said yesterday during a news conference as he held up a fake new york police sergeant 's badge alongside an authentic one mr weiner pointed out that the two were nearly identical from the golden hue to the span of the eagle 's wings you 'd have a very hard time determining which is the real sergeant and which is the sergeant who found his identity on the internet he said most web sites that sell the fake badges ask buyers to click a button saying that they intend to use them legally but there is nothing that these web site operators do to ensure that you are indeed following the rules mr weiner said the prohibition on purchasing fake badges is completely toothless he said and in this age of heightened awareness of terrorism we simply can not allow these things to continue a study by the general accounting office in 2000 found that plainclothes officers showing fake badges easily gained access to federal buildings including the headquarters of the cia the fbi and the justice department as well as the pentagon they were not searched or asked for additional identification this is a virtual pass for terrorists mr weiner said you can almost be any rank you want the potential for trouble is particularly acute in new york city which has nearly 40000 police officers mr weiner said in smaller communities he said officers are more widely known the president of the sergeants benevolent association in new york ed mullins voiced his support for the bill which would require anyone wishing to buy a fake badge including television movie and theater producers to submit an application to the applicable police department detailing what it would be used for collectors would only be able to buy badges encased in lucite
 the bargain hunters never bargained for this mutual fund managers who specialize in spotting undervalued stocks often relish market declines because they expect to find more companies trading at attractive prices but the current market swoon is proving deeply frustrating for even these so called value funds their biggest bets have performed much worse than expected hurting the funds returns and damaging their managers images as discerning stock pickers value managers reaped good returns in the past by scooping up stocks that had fallen out of favor but this year many of their choices have continued declining the main culprit is earnings prospects which have deteriorated sharply in the weak economy they have helped to drag down the standard poor 's 500 index by 29 percent through september hurting returns for nearly all types of stock funds if you 've been in equities it does n't matter what you 've owned in the past few months because there 's been nowhere to hide said bill nygren manager of the oakmark fund which takes a value approach but the lackluster returns of value funds have not resulted only from the general market decline funds have also made some spectacularly inopportune purchases recent accounting scandals have punished many value funds even though value managers are known for being cautious investors who thoroughly analyze financial statements worldcom and adelphia communications both of which filed for bankruptcy protection this year were owned by several large value funds both companies were held by the vanguard windsor fund which lost 202 percent of its value in the 12 months through sept 30 according to morningstar inc charles t freeman the manager of windsor declined to comment the pimco value fund was another large owner of worldcom and at the end of july the fund also had high exposure to other stocks that have fallen sharply in recent months including j p morgan chase and el paso the energy company the pimco fund was down 244 percent in the 12 months through sept 30 phil neugebauer a spokesman for pimco did not respond to calls seeking comment there is opportunity for value funds but investing is riskier for them than it was in the past said harold evensky the chairman of evensky brown katz a financial planning firm in coral gables fla there could be more shoes to drop in corporate america on average value funds investing in large companies lost 186 percent in the 12 months through sept 30 according to morningstar compared with a 217 percent decline for the s p 500 that slight outperformance may not be enough to convince investors to buy shares in an actively managed value fund rather than an s p 500 index fund in fact mr evensky said most value managers were finding it hard to beat value style exchange traded funds which track the equity markets the way indexed mutual funds do but trade throughout the day like stocks for example the ishares russell 1000 value index an exchange traded fund was down a less severe 186 percent for the 12 months through september and is far cheaper for individual investors than almost any value fund because of lower fees another exchange traded fund ishares s p midcap 400 barra value which focuses on medium sized companies was actually up 27 percent for the period value funds lead over growth funds has been shrinking of late in contrast to value funds growth funds focus more on the earnings power of a company than on whether the stock is cheap value funds have done markedly better for the last 12 months than growth funds large cap growth funds were down 209 percent for the 12 months through september but in the third quarter growth funds investing in large companies were actually down less than their large cap value funds 159 percent versus 182 percent dissatisfaction with value funds may be showing up in the tallies of money flowing in and out of funds after attracting nearly 50 billion of net inflows in the first five months of the year value funds had a 105 billion net outflow from june to august according to lipper a fund tracking firm in this brutal market some of the most prominent value managers have taken hits perhaps the most revered value manager is william h miller iii of the legg mason value trust the only fund to beat the s p 500 in each of the last 11 calendar years with a 285 percent decline through september it lagged behind the index by about 05 percentage points the legg mason opportunity fund a value fund also managed by mr miller was down 29 percent big recent stock purchases by mr miller have hurt him on june 30 the third largest holding in the value trust was mgic investment a mortgage insurer that fell sharply in september after issuing an earnings warning the fund also held big positions in citigroup jp morgan chase and fannie mae all down substantially this year in the opportunity fund americredit the consumer lender was the portfolio 's biggest holding at the end of june it fell more than 48 percent in september after announcing that it would issue stock to improve its liquidity mr miller declined to comment mr nygren of the oakmark fund another celebrated manager has also seen some large holdings decline sharply one was electronic data systems the computer services provider that plummeted over 65 percent in september because it said future earnings would be well below expectations mr nygren said he could not comment on eds the oakmark fund was down 118 percent for the 12 months through september some value managers remain upbeat bob olstein manager of the olstein financial alert fund down 76 percent for the 12 months through september said the negativity has gone way too far this is the most opportune time for investing i 've ever seen mr olstein 's bets on certain financial companies and semiconductor makers have not served him well this year but one large investment in an unloved industry has done better that is the arkansas best corporation a trucking company that he regards as well positioned to gain customers who once used consolidated freightways which filed for bankruptcy protection in september arkansas best has the excess capacity to easily pick up the new business mr olstein said at the end of september the stock was up 60 percent from its july low many value investors love panic sell offs believing that investors mistakenly lose faith in damaged companies many including mr miller have bought tyco international which is trying to resuscitate its reputation after its former chief executive l dennis kozlowski and chief financial officer mark h swartz were indicted on fraud charges the tyco bet could backfire badly tyco is conducting a review of its bookkeeping but said last week that it had found nothing so far that would require additional disclosure but if problems are found many value funds could suffer another serious setback

 while neither democrat denise majette nor republican representative john linder is a household name they both scored impressive victories over better known rivals in the georgia primary on tuesday ms majette a yale educated former judge handily defeated a five term democratic incumbent cynthia a mckinney a vocal liberal in the democratic primary in the state 's fourth congressional district mr linder cruised to an easy victory in the republican primary in the seventh congressional district over representative bob barr a strident conservative who four years ago had led the effort to impeach president bill clinton i may only be 5 foot 1 but tonight i am 10 feet tall ms majette 46 told cheering supporters at her victory celebration as she stood on a platform in order to be seen over the lectern by winning their respective primaries mr linder and ms majette are virtually assured of victories in the general election since their parties dominate both of their districts we 're just here this evening to congratulate john linder for having run a very good race mr barr said in conceding defeat we go into the fall race very much a united party mr linder 59 a former dentist and business executive whose phlegmatic style was a sharp contrast to mr barr 's sizzle had at times made his steady demeanor an issue in the campaign during one debate for example mr linder said to his opponent i will remind you that i am the one who has been married for 39 years to the same woman a subtle criticism of mr barr 53 who is in his third marriage the race between mr linder and mr barr two incumbents running in a district reconfigured by redistricting and the contest between ms majette and ms mckinney were the two highlights of the georgia primary in other important races representative saxby chambliss whose campaign received strong backing from the white house defeated two opponents in the republican primary for the senate and will face freshman democratic senator max cleland in november mr cleland ran unopposed in the democratic primary in the gubernatorial race former state senator sonny perdue defeated two opponents for the right to take on governor roy barnes a democrat with 89 percent of the vote counted in the seventh district mr linder had 67 percent to 33 percent for mr barr in the fourth district with 75 percent of the vote counted ms majette had 60 percent of the vote to ms mckinney 's 40 percent reports indicated a strong turnout of republican voters casting ballots in the democratic primary presumably in a bid to defeat ms mckinney 47 state officials were investigating the source of telephone calls made to voters in heavily republican areas telling them it is a violation of state and federal law to attempt to vote in a democratic primary without proper documentation republican leaders charged that the phone calls originated with the mckinney campaign as an attempt to tamp down republican crossover voting in the open primary a spokesman for ms mckinney denied the accusation both of the congressional races were noteworthy as intraparty spats in carefully drawn districts dominated by one party virtually assuring the winners of being elected to congress as a result neither race will have an impact on the narrow balance between the two parties in the house still both races featured well known personalities many from out of state and both races produced their share of vitriol ms mckinney who has served 10 years in the house has been criticized for a number of tart comments such as declaring that the bush administration may have ignored warnings of the sept 11 attacks and that president bush 's allies in multinational corporations have profited from the war on terrorism she also said she would have accepted a 10 million check from a saudi prince for victims of the attacks that mayor rudolph w giuliani of new york spurned after the prince suggested that america 's policies in the middle east were partly to blame for the hijackings the mckinney majette race also rekindled concerns about a split between blacks and jews a rift that many leaders of both communities hoped had healed in recent years but ms mckinney who has been vocal in support of arab causes drew much of her campaign financing from pro arab groups while jewish groups contributed to ms majette 's campaign a number of prominent blacks including the rev jesse jackson and louis farrakhan of the nation of islam who have been accused of making anti semitic remarks campaigned for ms mckinney on the republican side mr linder and mr barr who has served four terms ran against each other in a district that cuts across atlanta 's northern suburbs the revamped district was part of a new congressional map created by georgia 's overwhelmingly democratic legislature that shifted much of mr barr 's old seventh district into a new one that favored a democratic candidate both incumbents are conservatives and differ little on fiscal and social issues like cutting taxes gun control and abortion with little to distinguish themselves on issues or ideology the race featured more of an emphasis on style a former united states attorney mr barr burst on the national scene in 1997 when he became the first republican to call for the impeachment of mr clinton mr barr soon became a regular on talk shows and the next year was a house manager making the case in the senate for mr clinton 's removal as befits mr barr 's celebrity status he attracted a host of conservative luminaries including charlton heston g gordon liddy and oliver l north to campaign for him in another primary on tuesday in wyoming businessman eli bebout won the republican primary to succeed gov jim geringer who could not seek re election because of term limits mr bebout will face democrat dave freudenthal a former federal prosecutor in the general election in the fall

 the good news about the holiday travel season is that in some sense the worst is already over the sunday after thanksgiving traditionally the busiest day of the year for air travel has passed without notable delays or disruptions thanks in part to good weather but even though travel is spread over a longer period in late december flying at christmas presents a different challenge dealing with all the baggage that passengers check drag through security and cram into overhead compartments a daunting task for both the government and the airlines in keeping with the holiday spirit security officials and airline representatives have been acting a bit like bickering relatives when it comes to assigning blame for problems at the airport even before the busy season actually began we feel that there will almost certainly be delays caused by security lines said diana cronan a spokeswoman for the air transport association of america the trade group for united states airlines by telephone a week before thanksgiving brian turmail a spokesman for the federal transportation security administration responded that 's interesting because the average traveler reports they spend twice as long waiting to get their boarding pass as they do to go through security he was referring to a survey of passengers conducted by the department of transportation last august as it turned out some of the longest lines observed at the airport over the thanksgiving weekend were at coffee retailers according to a survey conducted by travelocity one undercurrent for the tension is the fact that the government and the airlines have yet to work out who is responsible for the nearly 12000 claims that have been submitted by passengers reporting problems with checked bags such as missing items since the security administration began screening luggage for explosives a year ago since then the agency has advised travelers to leave bags unlocked in case they need to be searched raising the still unresolved question of who is liable for missing or damaged contents caught in the middle roberta dibartolomeo is one of the passengers caught in the middle of that negotiation she is still waiting for a response to a claim she and her husband filed in january reporting items missing from their luggage after a flight last dec 25 although they were ultimately reimbursed through their homeowner 's insurance she said the lack of a response from the security administration was disheartening we went through the whole process and wrote them a letter she said somebody from that office should have responded mr turmail said her claim was most likely held up by the ongoing negotiations with the airlines mark hatfield another administration spokesman said that a system to acknowledge baggage complaints has since been created so where does that leave travelers with piles of presents sweaters and winter sports equipment ms dibartolomeo 's advice make sure you have really good insurance is probably a good place to start even when an airline does take responsibility for lost luggage its liability is limited to 2500 a passenger on domestic flights and 907 a pound on international flights about 640 for each piece of baggage and most airlines stipulate that they are not liable for electronic equipment jewelry and other valuables one bright spot this year is that travelers can now buy luggage locks that meet guidelines approved by the transportation security administration screeners can open the locks if necessary the first locks to meet those standards using a system developed by a company called travel sentry have gone on sale at a variety of retailers 20 for a pair of the larger locks sold by brookstone other manufacturers and retailers expect to have more products to meet the standards before the holidays but if you are traveling with expensive presents a better option may be to ship them separately through the delivery services that usually help out santa there are also a handful of companies that specialize in delivering luggage an option i tried for a trip to my parents house for thanksgiving with mixed feelings about the results i had to wait around the house for them to show up although they did appear within the time window they promised and if i did n't work at home i would have had to take the bag to work since they generally pick up only during business hours surprisingly costly i was surprised how expensive these services are the price quoted by sports express at its web site sportsexpresscom to ship a small suitcase weighing 20 pounds was 5261 one way plus 15 for additional insurance the company includes 500 worth of insurance for each order extra insurance costs 1 for each 100 in declared value and i had to send my bag overnight on a friday for monday arrival sports express and its competitors typically arrange deliveries through companies like federal express and united parcel service so generally they do not pick up or deliver items on saturday or sunday the fact that several airlines have partnered with sports express boosted my confidence and its online booking process was very thorough i arranged the whole delivery without picking up the phone it was only after i submitted my credit card number that i was told the price quote was an estimate and the final price would be determined by the actual weight of the bag when it was picked up but the bag was delivered by midday monday as promised and my visa was charged the original price quoted 6761 my take using a luggage delivery service may be worthwhile for skis or golf clubs or if you can place the cost on an expense account but for most recreational trips paying upward of 60 each way to ship a bag does n't buy enough convenience for bags you do take to the airport the transportation security administration recommends leaving presents unwrapped since they may have to be opened for inspection and that undeveloped film be packed in a carry on bag since it can be damaged by screening equipment this year a growing number of airlines are also encouraging passengers to check in online american delta northwest united continental us airways alaska and america west allow customers traveling on domestic e tickets and on some international routes to check in and print out a boarding pass at their web sites typically 90 minutes to 24 hours ahead but even if you follow all the travel advice dispensed during the holidays you may still encounter hiccups for my thanksgiving trip i sent one bag ahead bought new locks that can be opened by screeners for my carry on and logged on to my computer around midnight to check in for a 9 am flight the computer told me that the first leg was delayed meaning i would miss my connection which led to a scramble for a 6 am flight but at least by checking in online i had time to change my plans when i asked the agent if the airline would have called to tell me about the delay he said at this hour

 eugene cammarato the long beach democratic leader resigned last week as the city 's operations director after three years of criticism that the democratic controlled city council created the post as a political favor mr cammarato began work last week as labor and facilities director at nassau regional off track betting corporation in hempstead at a salary of 95000 but his 102000 a year post in long beach was not abolished and the city council appointed steven polcer a vice chairman of the long beach democratic party to be mr cammarato 's successor mr polcer who drew 82516 as the building commissioner will earn 97000 in the operations director post his appointment revived criticism that the local democratic party 's reach in the city 's government is too deep here we go again said stephen k lee a long beach lawyer who opposed mr cammarato 's role in the operations director post the line between the democratic party and the city of long beach is not blurred it 's nonexistent joel crystal the city council president defended mr polcer 's appointment saying the search for a successor centered on local residents to balance the recent appointments of outsiders to city posts he referred to harold porr iii who last month came from newburgh to be long beach city manager and william holst a former suffolk legislator who became the city 's corporation counsel in march we need someone who knows the city to help guide them mr crystal said in addition to mr polcer 's appointment the city promoted robert piazza to superintendent of street maintenance mr piazza will earn 86100 compared with the 82000 he drew as assistant superintendent mr lee said that mr piazza was also too close to mr cammarato and the democratic machine last year justice ira b warshawsky of state supreme court in mineola ruled that the city should stop paying mr cammarato 's salary the ruling was a response to a complaint mr lee brought on behalf of five residents that mr cammarato and two others including mr piazza held jobs that did not exist under the city charter one month later the city council formally created the operations director job mr lee is seeking the return of about 225000 in salaries paid to the three between july 1999 and justice warshawsky 's ruling in march 2001 a judgment on that issue is pending an appeal by the city on the ruling that the operations director post was created illegally mr cammarato who will receive a retirement payout of 204000 for benefits including accrued sick time and vacation declined to comment mr polcer and mr piazza did not return calls

 f lee bailey the lawyer who gained fame nearly 40 years ago for his defense of dr sam sheppard was disbarred today in florida citing his mishandling of stock forfeited by a drug smuggling client the florida supreme court unanimously ruled that mr bailey may not practice law in the state for at least five years the court called his conduct egregious and evidence of a complete disregard for the rules governing attorneys mr bailey part of the so called dream team that represented o j simpson in his murder trial was found to have misappropriated money earned from the stocks the court also ruled that he had kept the stocks despite a federal court order to relinquish them that he had lied to a federal judge and that he had put his financial interests above those of his client the complaints were brought in 1999 by the florida bar after mr bailey 's defense of claude duboc from 1994 to 1996 mr bailey had said money he earned from nearly 6 million of stock that had belonged to mr duboc was payment for his services but the florida bar contended that mr bailey knew all along that he was given control of the stocks with an understanding that they would be turned over to the federal government i 'm very pleased with the decision said david ristoff a lawyer for the bar group who pursued the case against mr bailey the supreme court decision is based on overwhelming evidence against him that he engaged in theft conflict of interest and misrepresenting his client which are the most serious things lawyers can engage in mr bailey did not return a telephone call to his law office in west palm beach a lawyer who represented him before the supreme court beverly pohl said her client could decide to appeal the case to the united states supreme court we are obviously disappointed ms pohl said but we have no idea if we will do that or not the seven judges decided against permanent disbarment as had been recommended by a judge in collier county who conducted disciplinary proceedings last year mr bailey has to wait at least five years before he can reapply to practice law here to be readmitted mr bailey has to retake the bar examination and be cleared in a background and character review the court gave mr bailey 30 days to close his law practice
 in his first appearance before the legislature as new york city 's interim schools chancellor harold o levy displayed an easy confidence with lawmakers today as he asked for more money for the city 's beleaguered public schools i 've got a short term so i get to say things more candidly perhaps mr levy said interrupting his opening statement to set a no nonsense tone while partisan politics have bedeviled new chancellors in the past mr levy a corporate lawyer was not ruffled when confronted with questions about his nonrelationship with mayor rudolph w giuliani who opposed his selection last month and has called him unqualified and a puppet of the teachers union at today 's budget hearing by the assembly and senate senator daniel r hevesi a democrat from queens urged mr levy to remember the problems encountered by his predecessor rudy crew after his friendship with the mayor soured you 've got to have some kind of working relationship with the mayor it 's absolutely essential mr hevesi said mr levy responded simply i would welcome it later another lawmaker asked mr levy if he had heard from mr giuliani i have heard from the mayor 's office and i have had several communications mr levy said pointedly not mentioning the mayor himself mr levy outlined an ambitious plan that seeks to recruit more certified teachers provide summer school for all students who do not meet academic standards and evaluate district superintendents with new criteria and like every chancellor before him he lobbied for a greater share of the state 's education budget we have 36 percent of the money 38 percent of the kids and 80 percent of the problems he said i want to have the money to make the system top quality at one point mr levy openly disagreed with an assemblyman john j flanagan a republican from suffolk county suggested that all school districts not just new york city should receive more money mr levy shook his head i do n't agree he said bluntly you have a fine education system and new york city has an underfunded one for their part the lawmakers did not seem to take offense at mr levy 's criticisms of a public school system that he repeatedly said was critically underfunded senator hevesi said he was impressed with mr levy 's comments and agreed with his education priorities but then mr levy was not just any education official with an outstretched hand he is familiar with albany having been handpicked four years ago by assembly speaker sheldon silver the democrat from the lower east side to serve on the state board of regents mr levy resigned from the board last month to become the interim chancellor a job for which mr silver had lobbied on his behalf today following his testimony mr levy joined mr silver at a news conference he calls things like they are no matter where the chips may fall and he took this position in hopes of laying a foundation and straightening out problems at the board of education mr silver said of mr levy he earned a lot of respect from people who had n't heard him before mr levy said he believed the key to improving the city 's public school system was in hiring better qualified teachers he said that more than 10000 of the city 's 78000 teachers were not state certified if you get quality teachers you get quality results he said it 's not biology it 's not race it 's not language it 's not who your parents are it 's not socioeconomic status it 's teacher quality randi weingarten president of the united federation of teachers who also testified at today 's budget hearing said uncertified teachers were the result of low salaries for teachers in the city 's schools she said thousands of teachers leave for jobs at suburban schools where they typically earn 20 to 30 percent more mr levy also asked lawmakers for more money to raise teaching salaries saying he would need the financial incentive to recruit more certified teachers and persuade them to give up part of their summer vacations to teach lagging students he requested an additional 15 million to hire inspectors and establish a system for monitoring attendance records and test scores
 when president mwai kibaki of kenya arrived at the white house recently for a state visit his wife lucy kibaki was at his side resplendent in a flowing gown perhaps fortunately for the white house protocol office which has little experience with polygamous relationships mr kibaki left his second wife wambui kibaki back home mr kibaki 's multiple marriage has been known for decades among close friends and family in his native village of othaya near mount kenya but most kenyan voters first learned of it on sunday morning nearly a year into mr kibaki 's presidency when a local newspaper the east african standard splashed a profile of mr kibaki 's second wife on its front page such a complicated family life is not uncommon here by no means limited to muslims polygamy is widely practiced in africa particularly among the well off members of mr kibaki 's generation who can afford multiple dowries and the expense of keeping more than one home but polygamy is also falling from favor according to social scientists and women 's rights advocates especially among younger kenyans and mr kibaki has not sought to publicize his living arrangements his official campaign web site for example mentioned only one mrs kibaki i do n't believe in sharing husbands said rose nganga 20 a nairobi college student if my husband were to bring another wife he would have to either divorce her or me why should i be the second wheel to a man for polygamy to work peacefully the wives must buy into the tradition sometimes an older wife will actually assist her husband in choosing a younger bride typically to provide some assistance with all the work at the homestead but kenya 's newspapers are rife with stories of disputes between wives of the same husband they frequently scheme against each other and sometimes come to blows andrew 26 a nairobi bartender who declined to give his last name grew up in such a situation his father took his mother 's sister as a second wife when he was about 7 i remember being confused on whether i should call her aunt or stepmother he said in an interview it became too much for my mother and we left i was not in a polygamous family for that long but it was long enough to understand that it breaks home and hearts mr kibaki 's home life is by all accounts a calm one lucy kibaki a former schoolteacher whom mr kibaki married in the 1960 's lives with the president wambui kibaki who was also a schoolteacher before meeting mr kibaki in the 1970 's occupies the presidential ranch it is lucy kibaki who typically appears at mr kibaki 's side at ceremonial functions and acts as first lady but wambui kibaki is often just a few rows behind the first couple as she was last friday at a 40th anniversary celebration of kenya 's independence from britain wambui kibaki has her own security detail and more access to the presidential office compound than many ministers parliament is debating whether the government ought to provide benefits should a retired president have more than one spouse in the only interview she has given since her husband took over the presidency a year ago wambui kibaki said she was comfortable with her arrangement i do not feel restricted she told the standard i have my time with him just as before he became president i go to state house when i want and i ca n't complain i am his wife and not being made public does not bother me mr kibaki is not the first polygamous politician here kenya 's first president jomo kenyatta had several wives although only one of them took on the official role of first lady a recently retired member of parliament dickson kihaika kimani has more than a dozen wives last fall he sought to have two of them join him in parliament but voters rejected their candidacies and his as well supporters of the practice say that in the aids era polygamy is a far healthier arrangement than another one favored by many men one wife and one or more mistresses or even prostitutes on the same day that the standard was detailing mr kibaki 's home life nairobi 's other major newspaper the daily nation broke the story of a major prostitution sting that rounded up more than 100 young girls many of them university students among those caught up in the police roundup were three top kenyan politicians all of them married men and all videotaped with seminude prostitutes in their vehicles but polygamous relationships too are blamed for helping spread aids the more sexual partners involved critics say even under the cloak of marriage the greater risk of the disease spreading particularly as some men take on multiple wives and still have affairs on the side in an advertising campaign aimed at reducing the spread of aids mr kibaki urges kenyans to be faithful he avoids the ticklish question of how much faithfulness he thinks that kenyan men ought to spread around

 bathed in cheers and blinking in the unaccustomed sunlight 26 student protesters emerged today from a harvard university administration building where they had staged a three week sit in to demand a living wage for the university 's lowest paid workers harvard did not agree to give them exactly what they had sought an immediate 1025 minimum wage for all workers but the protesters said the university agreed to reopen a subject it had called closed announcing that a committee of faculty members workers officials and students would re examine university wage policies harvard also promised that until that committee reached its conclusions the university would stop giving custodial and dining service work to outside subcontractors it also agreed to an early renegotiation of its contract with its custodians union which could allow a wage increase retroactive to may 1 and it agreed to re examine the health insurance co payment for its lowest paid workers out of 13000 harvard employees about 400 workers mainly janitors dining hall workers and security guards earn less than 1025 an hour several hundred temporary workers for subcontractors also are paid less than that several hundred protesters proclaimed victory today at a rally in harvard yard outside massachusetts hall where the sit in had been staged mainly in the corridor outside the office of harvard 's president neil l rudenstine you are the moral conscience of the university bob haynes president of the massachusetts afl cio told the crowd i hope my kids grow up to be just like you harvard officials also expressed satisfaction with the outcome i think everybody comes out of this with something paul grogan a university spokesman said we have not agreed to a 'living wage mr grogan said and the university had ended the sit in without the use of force there was a lot of forbearance and that could have been different and one hopes that is recognized asked if the students who occupied the building would be punished mr grogan said that was up to the administrators and faculties of the schools in which they were enrolled more than 400 faculty members signed a letter supporting the protesters who were also endorsed by massachusetts two united states senators and an array of local politicians and labor leaders organized labor played an important role it had helped some students learn to organize sit ins and then acted as a go between with the students and the administration the harvard protest was part of a national living wage campaign by student groups and unions some students at other universities said they were watching the harvard sit in to see whether it was worth emulating as the protesters left massachusetts hall today ending what is believed to have been the longest sit in in a harvard building supporters presented each with a red rose inside the office workers and administrators who had played host to the protesters drank champagne and the hall where the students sat for weeks looked immaculate except for a couple of garbage bags they even vacuumed the university police chief francis d riley said of the protesters
 it 's malignant then give it to me straight doc how long have i got the correct answer to that question a new study suggests may be more optimistic than doc thinks because statistical methods used in calculating cancer survival are too conservative the study says americans with cancer are actually living longer than many doctors have been led to expect and patients researching their disease on the internet may be reading prognoses that are grimmer than the truth a study of 24 million americans in whom cancer was diagnosed from 1978 through 1998 to be published today in the lancet a british medical journal argues that the traditional cohort method used to estimate survival rates does not consider the leaps made in cancer diagnosis and treatment in recent years using a different method called period analysis the epidemiology study concluded that all cancer patients whose tumors are diagnosed today have a 51 percent chance of living 20 years the cohort method would give them only a 40 percent chance the differences vary widely with the types of cancer patients with cancer of the prostate ovary rectum or breast or those with leukemia or hodgkin 's disease probably have much better survival rates than previous figures suggested said the study 's author dr hermann brenner of the german center for research on aging in heidelberg who used the national cancer institute 's database for example dr brenner said a woman with ovarian cancer may have been told that she has a 35 percent chance of surviving 20 years in fact she probably has at least a 50 percent chance of living that long a man with prostate cancer may be told that he has a 44 percent chance of surviving 20 years in fact dr brenner said he probably has an 81 percent chance however dr brenner conceded that some of the most significant improvements in survival come not from miracle cures but from new tests that find tumors including tiny slow growing ones very early for prostate cancer it 's clear that early diagnosis or even over diagnosis may play a role he said but for colorectal cancer leukemia and other cancers he said early detection and better treatment produce genuinely longer lives the current chance of living 20 years after a diagnosis of rectal cancer is about 49 percent not 39 percent his study found and with leukemia 26 percent rather than 21 percent the new analysis included 20 year relative survival rates of 95 percent for thyroid cancer 88 percent for testicular cancer better than 80 percent for melanomas and prostate cancer and 65 percent for breast cancer the study did not analyze which outcomes stemmed from earlier diagnosis and which stemmed from better treatment other biostatistics experts agreed that dr brenner 's analysis probably produces results closer to what a modern prognosis should be in an era when life expectancies are going up even the period method will understate survival probability said dr david a freedman a professor of statistics at the university of california at berkeley to estimate how many patients will live 20 years the simpler cohort method looks at patients whose disease was diagnosed in 1978 and counts how many were still alive in 1998 the flaw in using that method to predict the survival of someone whose cancer was diagnosed in 2002 is that it assumes a 1978 treatment plan with period analysis a statistician would use 1997 data to compute the probability of living one year 1996 data to compute the probability of surviving a second and so on these probabilities can be multiplied together to estimate the probability of surviving 20 years demographers use this method of analysis to compute life expectancy because looking back 80 years to the birth dates of cohorts of aging citizens says little about life expectancy today but dr donald berry head of biostatistics at the m d anderson cancer center in houston cautioned that the study might have little or no effect on what patients hear from their doctors no clinician well almost no clinician dr berry said would simply quote to a patient the overall survival numbers for a type of cancer any good doctor making a prognosis he said takes into account the size of a tumor how far it has spread the patient 's age success rates of new treatments and other factors dr brenner agreed but noted that these survival statistics based on the old numbers are on the internet everywhere and are seen there by patients an advantage of his calculation method dr brenner said is that it is faster at making obvious the impact of new therapies such observations can be useful to policy makers who parcel out dollars to researchers dr brenner used the surveillance epidemiology and end results database of the national cancer institute which has tracked cancers in about 10 percent of the american population for 30 years dr brenda edwards the deputy director of the cancer institute 's database unit said dr brenner 's conclusions were correct adding that we 're going to look at some of the features of his method not all the news from dr brenner 's recalculation was optimistic some cancers that have always had grim prognoses including those of the lungs esophagus liver and pancreas as well as multiple myelomas still have very low 20 year survival rates of 2 percent to 8 percent
 the letter was signed a santa beliver and made a simple request give us a good reason to smile in this wonderful season how could julie taylor say no ms taylor was sorting through the letters to santa claus from needy children collected at manhattan 's general post office which for more than 70 years has made them available to the public under the auspices of a program called operation santa claus the tone intrigued her the whole feeling of the letter was so genuine she would later say it was honest and straight from the heart it began my name is ashley i am 6 years old it said she was writing because mom could not and added my brother melvin ca n't talk there was no explanation nor was there a last name this family is very needed the writer went on in prose beyond the years of a 6 year old we would n't have christmas if you do n't reach us ms taylor a matter of fact woman made up her mind folded up the piece of ruled paper and went off to shop and so a letter from a child brought together ms taylor the daughter of missionaries from oregon and the azcona family children of the dominican fields living on public assistance in washington heights briefly during one of the darkest holiday seasons in memory a ray of hold on you might be saying not another dose of christmas treacle all right then thanks to anthrax letters to santa are irradiated these days mailed presents can not just say from the north pole but must have a return address the number of letters is down to an estimated 200000 from 280000 last year fewer volunteers are walking in to take part in operation santa claus though many people are participating by phone and the program 's office has a new computer program to guard against savvy children who send numerous letters to increase their chances more than half are duplicates but none of that crossed ms taylor 's mind a good thing for the azcona children and perhaps for the treacle lovers of the world as a chill gathered on the last day of fall ms taylor drove her creaky 1984 jeep wagoneer uptown and parked on yes st nicholas avenue wearing a red santa hat she walked up a flight of stairs and saw the door of apartment 26a open a sticker declared that inside was ps 115 's student of the month the student as it turns out is ashley hidalgo actually 5 years old her brother is milvio 3 whose name was anglicized in the letter milvio is tumbling about on a worn linoleum floor ashley a girl of large eyes and long lashes sits on a plastic covered couch with her favorite book my silly snowman a moment of panic seizes ms taylor as she enters the one bedroom apartment there are three children instead of two she worries that she misread the letter but she finds out that one of the children is a cousin carlos lopez 5 i 'm not quite santa but close she says to no one in particular as ashley and milvio 's mother francisca azcona and her sister lucila azcona look on puzzled are you ashley i brought you some presents you were asking for ms taylor says to the girl i know a bunch of folks ms taylor continues trying to break the ice you know rudolph ashley and milvio examine the packages this is mine this is my mom 's ashley says reading the labels ms azcona a gentle 28 year old woman does not speak she does not know english and can barely read or write in spanish her native language because she grew up as granddaddy 's girl her family says in a rural area around san jose de las matas in the dominican republic she was never made to go to school so she is taking a basic english class at ps 115 ashley helps her with homework and when ashley needs help ms azcona calls the girl 's father milvio hidalgo who lives elsewhere as the letter said mom ca n't write and milvio can not talk because he has not learned to he suffers from learning disabilities ms azcona is not sure exactly why but she blames the problems on a stressful pregnancy or maybe on the bite on milvio 's head from a rat when he was 2 months old but the boy is making progress he can say words like mommy and tio uncle ms azcona 's nickname lillian comes out giggia she keeps careful track of records of his care signing forms in a shaky print the children 's toys consist mainly of some stuffed animals a toy computer a doll 's bed money is tight ms azcona survives on 290 a month in public assistance 50 a month in child support and 186 in food stamps outside there are drug dealers on the corner this christmas is worse because i have nothing to give ms azcona said in an interview before ms taylor 's unexpected arrival i do n't have the money to buy what they want she begins to cry and turns her face away ms azcona came to new york in 1990 two years after the arrival of another 18 year old ms taylor who came from salem ore to study acting at new york university ms taylor 's father was an independent missionary she lived on indian reservations until age 10 and then on the top floor of a halfway house called chemawa chapel run by her parents for a time in the early 1970 's she her parents and her brother and sister survived on 500 a month in donations one year on christmas eve a sears truck pulled up to the chapel and out came

 for all the emphasis that pentagon planners have put on special operations forces in a war against the network of osama bin laden and the taliban government at the moment relatively few of these secretive soldiers are within striking distance of the heart of afghanistan officials at the pentagon say as the military 's mobilization accelerated this week a defense department official said that only a few dozen members of the military 's special operations forces had deployed into the region so far short of an intelligence coup disclosing mr bin laden 's location that is scarcely enough to scour the caves and canyons of the country looking for him and his captains but an additional 500 or so members of special operations units will be laced among the 23000 united states troops now landing in egypt for a monthlong military exercise bright star which begins next week pentagon officials say they could easily swing over toward afghanistan one pentagon official said and other special operations forces will most likely deploy with many units bound for the region with so few of them there so far the initial mission of these fighters has focused on the more conventional of their many specialized roles these include scouting targets and standing by to illuminate them with laser beams that precisely guide missiles and bombs to the most important ones recalling the persian gulf war of a decade ago paul d wolfowitz the deputy secretary of defense said this week that the most effective means for finding scud missiles iraqi scud missiles was putting very brave special forces people on the ground in western iraq but he conceded that their daring sometimes went to waste when they got there and they found targets we did n't have the kind of integration with our air capability to make that bravery effective mr wolfowitz said special operations forces are also the most likely soldiers to carry out another strategy that pentagon officials have spoken of assisting resistance forces of the northern alliance in their campaign against the taliban 's military assisting forces that are in opposition to the government of a hostile country now that is a classic special forces mission said one veteran of the army special forces the green berets the hope has been both to dislodge the taliban regime and to flush out members of al qaeda the terrorist network and counterterrorism generally is another of the particular missions of special operations units wayne a downing a retired four star army general who headed the united states special operations command has joined the national security council as the president 's new director for counterterrorism american commandos are capable of much more than hiding for days on end and working in the dark of night to locate targets or propping up indigenous rebels to do the fighting these forces receive the most intense training in the military and some of its most sophisticated radios and weapons so they can wipe out targets on their own special forces wage their corner of the war with intense and concentrated violence that can be important tactically to the broader mission and disruptive psychologically to an enemy current and past members of these units say in the words of one former special operations officer they fight fast and they fight furious and then they get out they can be secretly inserted into enemy territory in pitch darkness by pave low and pave hawk helicopters that skirt the terrain for heavier loads and longer distances there is the combat talon a modified cargo plane that needs only 750 feet of rudimentary runway to land so secret are the special operations forces missions that their movements into and around the region are blacked out of slide presentations about the war effort shown to some of the most senior military leaders at the pentagon their importance to that effort though is no secret secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld has made it clear that in this campaign a lot of it will be special operations as the air force readies high altitude food drops over afghanistan an operation aimed at filling the stomachs as well winning the hearts of the afghan people and undermining the taliban 's legitimacy in their minds special forces could stealthily search for identify and help destroy taliban anti aircraft systems whose capabilities remain an unknown pentagon officials say that mission would become even more critical if president bush orders a sustained bombing campaign to squeeze the taliban by attacking command posts arms depots airfields training camps and storage sites for the heroin that has underwritten the taliban officials say special operations forces do everything from coordinating refugee relief to training foreign soldiers to reconstituting a water purification system to preparing leaflets urging surrender in dialects that few american soldiers have ever heard spoken there are 40000 members of united states special operations units budgeted at just over 3 billion or about 13 percent of all military spending said col bill darley a spokesman for the special operations command most special operations personnel who work in civil affairs are in reserve units as are many of those trained in psychological operations units vary in size and specialty from the top secret delta force which specializes in counterterrorism to navy seal teams that specialize in coastal reconnaissance infiltration and demolition to the larger units of army rangers perhaps the best trained infantry in the world but spectacular failures still haunt these forces there was the aborted hostage rescue in iran in 1980 during the 1989 invasion of panama the forces had a disproportionate number of casualtiesthe disastrous attempt to kidnap a somali warlord mohammed farrah aidid in 1993 certainly ended public support for involvement there

 wherefore security being the true design and end of government thomas paine advised in 1776 it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us with the least expense and greatest benefit is preferable to all others such common sense is needed in congress on aviation security everyone agrees that the current system in which barely profitable airlines contract with private companies provides inadequate incentives for security airlines seek the lowest cost providers federal standards are lax and poorly enforced so security companies provide the bare minimum and sometimes less the main disagreement is whether screening should be contracted out by airports to companies working under federal oversight or whether screeners should be federal employees or whether the president should have the flexibility to choose between these models economic logic says you usually get what you pay for airline security is no exception low pay is particularly problematic screeners and other security workers are paid the minimum wage or slightly more not surprisingly companies can recruit only minimally skilled workers better security will require employees with enough common sense to search luggage thoroughly if they discover passengers with knives in their pockets regardless of what federal standards require every contingency can never be spelled out low pay also causes high turnover the general accounting office found that annual turnover for screeners varied from 37 percent in honolulu to 416 percent in st louis the average was 126 percent at the 19 largest airports high turnover has a potentially pernicious effect because it makes it easier for terrorists to get airport jobs high turnover also raises training costs and reduces the incentive to provide training in the first place a new study directed by michael reich of the university of california at berkeley examines the effect of an initiative at san francisco international airport that established recruitment compensation training and performance standards for all workers in security areas or engaged in security tasks in april 2000 starting pay for screeners rose from 591 an hour to 10 plus health benefits turnover fell from 95 to 19 percent employers reported that morale skills and performance improved while absences and grievances fell looking across 19 airports professor reich also found that lower turnover was associated with a greater likelihood of detecting security breaches both the house and senate bills would raise pay but the senate bill which federalizes workers would raise it more the house only vaguely authorizes the transportation department to set minimum compensation levels when appropriate federal workers would be more likely to unionize although the service employees international union has made inroads with security workers it is disingenuous however to say unions and democrats favor federalizing security to increase membership the service employees union opposes federalizing the work force because it would lose members while the largest government union supports it if all 28000 screeners were unionized membership would increase by only one tenth of a percent anyway a more heavily unionized work force would not jeopardize security ever since the seminal study by the economists charles brown and james medoff most studies have found that unions raise productivity even in the public sector unions raise wages and reduce turnover so it is not surprising they lead to higher productivity although at higher cost european airports which commonly contract with the private sector for security provide only limited guidance on the advantages of public versus private employees first firing for cause is about as easy in the private sector in europe as in the public sector here second pay and benefits for low level workers in europe are much higher the main potential advantage from private contractors stems from their incentive to use resources efficiently most important competition among private companies may result in security innovations and the option of contracting to private providers shields government should a terrorist attack occur government could quickly replace the contractor giving the appearance and possibly reality of improving security the main risk of using private contractors is that they could marshal their resources to influence regulators indeed the aviation security association a group representing security firms that was formed two days after sept 11 is lobbying for bigger budgets and higher pay could it be that cost plus contracts which lead to increased profit when costs rise have something to do with their sudden interest in worker pay contracts must be written with safety in mind the house bill simply leaves this up to the transportation department companies should be penalized if they fail undercover tests profits should not be just a mark up over cost another risk is a shortage of federal employees to perform the crucial supervision background checks training and certification federal employment is down 10 percent since 1966 and will private workers have access to cia fbi and ins data networks regardless of who employs the screeners security issues still remain it takes a village to turn around a 747 said julie neff who just retired after 30 years as a flight attendant because her relatives were concerned for her safety caterers cleaners and others have access to planes what is missing from both bills but in the san francisco plan professor reich said is the inclusion of higher standards for the other workers who have access to the planes president bush is said to be readying an executive order in case the house and senate remain gridlocked so here 's a brandeisian proposal direct the transportation department to contract out screening in some airports and use federal workers in others then have the federal aviation administration conduct random undercover tests to see which system is working best as thomas paine argued the representative system of government is calculated to produce the wisest laws by collecting wisdom where it can be found economic scene alan b krueger is the bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at princeton university and editor of the journal of economic perspectives e mail

 right now cisco systems seems as close to perfect as a technology company can be the biggest maker of internet communications equipment cisco is also the second most valuable company in the nation after general electric it has succeeded in elevating its chief executive john chambers to near deity status in some quarters and has even managed to stay in the government 's good graces in contrast to microsoft among others which all means that this is probably an excellent time to think about which companies have a legitimate shot at eating cisco 's lunch after all one of the canons of the technology business the last two decades has been that it is at a company 's moment of maximum optimism that the seeds of trouble are most likely germinating think ibm or for that matter microsoft actually the companies that appear best positioned to be the next powerhouses in communications equipment do not want to eat cisco 's lunch at all rather moving in new economy time they are planning financial and technical smorgasbords of their own for the next generation of digital networks in an arboreal coincidence the two leading candidates among the many young companies vying to be the next cisco are called juniper networks and sycamore networks though they do very different things the two companies are remarkably similar in many ways they have innovative technologies juniper in high capacity internet routers and sycamore in optical networking they are both narrowly focused but forward looking they have the financial resources to position themselves for growth and perhaps most important each is led by an executive who has been there before what 's interesting about juniper and sycamore is that what you have is that this is not just a category killer but in many cases a category definer said steven d levy a lehman brothers communications equipment analyst they 're both hypergrowth companies and they have managements that have seen at least one or two wars cisco juniper and sycamore are spoiling to sell equipment to both established and upstart communications carriers for the next generation of high speed networks those networks will be necessary to meet the growing demand for internet and other data communications services even though it barely generated 100 million in revenue last year juniper has already established its leadership in a sector that cisco wants to own ultrahigh capacity internet switches put simply juniper 's systems can route more billions of digital bits each second more reliably than anyone else 's with its almost ludicrously impressive financial strength cisco is never to be discounted but there are good reasons to believe that juniper will be able to go toe to toe with cisco the next few years first juniper is focused on high end internet routers for big communications carriers cisco had its start selling relatively low capacity routers for use in corporate networks and analysts say it still derives two thirds of its revenue from corporate customers though it is selling more to communications carriers second as strong as cisco may be in developing new technologies the company is best known for acquiring and integrating other companies but there are not many companies that cisco could acquire to help in its battle against juniper nexabit networks one company in the same sector has been acquired by lucent technologies while avici systems another high end routing company has not yet announced big commercial customers in a bit of backhand diplomacy scott kriens juniper 's chief executive said our success does n't mean that the other will go away cisco is certainly not going to go away just like ibm did not go away but they are not any more likely to dominate networking in the future than ibm dominated computers mr kriens himself is well positioned to compete against cisco cisco 's carrier sales group essentially did not exist until cisco acquired mr kriens previous company stratacom for about 4 billion in 1996 in that sense mr kriens is quite similar to daniel smith sycamore 's chief executive sycamore is at the forefront of the next generation of optical networking which is set to allow communications carriers to route digital information from one point to another using lightwaves cisco has tried to add optical networking gear to its offerings with its acquisitions the last year of the cerent corporation monterey networks and a unit of pirelli of italy but it remains a minor player in that market sycamore 's main competition in optical networking is not cisco but the giants of the communications industry including lucent nortel networks of canada and fujitsu of japan mr smith 's previous company cascade communications was a competitor of stratacom for much of the 1990 's and is now deep inside lucent by way of its sale in 1997 to ascend communications which was subsequently acquired by lucent like mr kriens mr smith is betting that his company 's focus on a specific and potentially lucrative niche will allow it to outmaneuver titans like lucent and cisco that are trying to span a variety of communications sectors and like any good entrepreneur mr smith tempers his confidence with caution i truly do respect cisco he said they 're very aggressive in every way but i sure do n't fear them i know that when i 'm on the field with them i better have my chinstrap buckled and be ready to hit and i think they know that about me

 as allied troops interview iraqi scientists the chances grow of finding the chemical weaponry that western governments believe saddam hussein was hiding since the gulf war of 1991 if the troops do find it they will also find something else that the means for making it came primarily from western companies years ago below is a picture of the origins of what iraq said it imported for its chemical weapon effort the data was given to united nations inspectors in the late 1990 's and was reconfirmed in iraq 's 12000 page declaration last fall but the statistical material on which it is based remained confidential until recently the data reveals that firms in germany and france outstripped all others in selling the most important thing specialized chemical industry equipment that is particularly useful for producing poison gas without this equipment none of the other imports would have been of much use iraq did n't declare everything it bought so the data is incomplete but they can be presumed to be reliable as far as they go in general the pattern of iraqi behavior with united nations inspectors was to admit buying something only after learning that the inspectors already knew about it thus it seems logical to assume that the admitted imports actually occurred iraq sometimes lied about the quantities of ingredients or munitions to protect suppliers or to conceal stocks remaining on hand equipment on the other hand was listed in discrete units so those quantities seem to be reliable the countries of origin are compiled based on the exporter not the manufacturer because it was the exporter who decided to sell a sensitive item to iraq most of the equipment described in the report is restricted for export today even though it also has civilian uses but it was probably not restricted when it was sold in the 1980 's while individual items may have had innocuous uses the usefulness of a combination of items on an order for making poison gas could have tipped off a seller a former united nations inspector citing one case said anyone looking at the order could see that all the chemicals were for sarin the absence of american firms from this picture does not mean that none supplied mr hussein 's mass destruction weapons programs american firms show up on lists of suppliers of anthrax strains to iraq and of advanced electronics for nuclear and missile sites gary milhollin directs the wisconsin project a research group in washington that tracks mass destruction weapons kelly motz is associate director and arthur shulman is a research associate contributed to this project

one of the crew had been christa mcauliffe a schoolteacher astronaut he spoke to them directly i know it 's hard to understand that sometimes painful things like this happen it 's all part of the process of exploration and discovery it 's all part of taking a chance and expanding man 's horizons the future does n't belong to the faint hearted it belongs to the brave the challenger crew was pulling us into the future and we 'll continue to follow them he ended in poetry quoting john gillespie magee jr a canadian air force pilot who died in a spitfire crash in 1941 mr reagan said the astronauts would be remembered as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of god john f kennedy often addressed a worried nation he gave great speeches on berlin and on civil rights but he had a singular challenge on oct 22 1962 he was not memorializing as bill clinton did after the oklahoma city bombing nor was he announcing a specific course of action as president george h w bush did when outlining the 1991 attack on iraq as bob shrum a speechwriter for top democrats for three decades put it mr kennedy 's task was not just to react but to define the event to which the country was reacting he laid out the problem soviet offensive missiles in cuba despite a pledge foreign minister andrei a gromyko had given him personally he explained the plan a blockade of cuba to halt delivery of any more military equipment and a warning that if a missile was fired the united states would strike at the soviet union and he closed with a determination that moved the nation noting that there was danger implicitly that of world war iii ahead the path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards as all paths are but it is the one most consistent with our character and courage as a nation and our commitments around the world the cost of freedom is always high and americans have always paid it and one path we shall never choose and that is the path of surrender of submission in the era of radio no one commanded national attention as strongly as franklin delano roosevelt starting on the day he took the oath of office it was the depths of the depression and he told his listeners the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance but perhaps his simplest and most forceful speech was delivered the day after pearl harbor when he told congress yesterday dec 7 1941 a date which will live in infamy the united states of america was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of japan he cataloged japan 's deceit and its ravages throughout the pacific but the point was to rally not educate since americans already knew of the attacks no matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion he said the american people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory like mr reagan 's peggy noonan and mr kennedy 's theodore c sorensen mr roosevelt had speechwriters but according to his biographer arthur m schlesinger robert e sherwood and samuel rosenman were both in new york on dec 7 1941 they caught the first train to washington but the president had already dictated his speech to his secretary grace tully on tuesday in the crisis of the moment some of president bush 's first comments seemed casual almost unscripted from sarasota he promised to hunt down those folks who committed this act at barksdale air force base he offered thanks for all the folks who have been fighting hard to rescue our fellow citizens he had a more organized message in the evening from the oval office but his delivery without much practice was not commanding even when he warned we will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbored them but three days later he spoke most effectively at the washington national cathedral where he said we are here in the middle hour of our grief so many have suffered so great a loss and today we express our nation 's sorrow he was firm when he said this nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger this conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing still his true test is ahead he will be judged both for oratory and policy by what he says when he goes on television some night soon to explain that the united states has just struck back correction september 23 2001 sunday an article last sunday about historic presidential speeches misstated the means by which two speechwriters for president franklin delano roosevelt rushed back to washington from new york after the japanese attack on pearl harbor the two robert e sherwood and samuel rosenman took a plane not a train
 senate republican officials said today that they had been unable to muster enough votes to begin oil drilling in the alaska wildlife refuge probably dooming the signature energy plan of the bush administration a vote on the drilling plan will probably take place by friday or early next week and lobbying groups in favor of oil production in alaska say they have not given up hope of achieving a slim senate majority but republican officials say they are not counting on more than 48 votes for drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge at this point we do n't have the 50 votes and i do n't think we 're going to get them a republican official said so the democrats will probably be able to strip it out such a vote would be an embarrassment for the bush administration which came into office in 2001 vowing to reverse president bill clinton 's refusal to permit drilling in the refuge it was unable to get the measure through the senate last year when it was controlled by democrats after the republicans took control of the senate in january administration officials hoped for a different result but they said at least eight republicans and most democrats remained opposed to the plan supporters of drilling said they had hoped to take advantage of rising oil prices and a potential war with iraq to argue that the united states needs more domestic oil production to free itself from sources in the middle east in congressional testimony on wednesday gale a norton the interior secretary called the area flat white nothingness and said it represented the nation 's greatest potential for future oil our reliance on foreign oil has impacts on the lives of american families farmers and workers as the current gasoline price increase shows ms norton said as long as we have planes trains and automobiles powered by oil and gas we will need a homegrown stable reliable source of supply but drilling in the refuge remains highly unpopular in public opinion polls a result of years of efforts by environmental groups to depict oil production as disastrous to an unspoiled and fragile area that is home to many wildlife species opponents also say the refuge would not produce enough oil to justify the effort and oil companies have not been nearly as enthusiastic about the prospect as the bush administration or the government of alaska it has never made sense to drill for oil there and citizens from around the country have made their views on that clear to their senators said gene karpinski executive director of the us public interest research group an advocacy association that has lobbied heavily against the plan but mr karpinski added that he was nervous about declaring victory because republicans might have more senators on their side than they were revealing we remain cautiously optimistic that a majority of the senate opposes drilling he said but of course we 'll be working overtime till the question is called to ensure that we get the votes we need the drilling plan is in the 2004 budget resolution that the senate began debating today it is a measure that sets the overall revenues and spending limits for the coming fiscal year democrats plan to propose an amendment that would delete the reference to drilling and republicans will need 50 votes to stop the amendment but at this point republicans say they have only 48 if the drilling plan is removed from the budget process republicans will not be able to raise it again without encountering a democratic filibuster which requires 60 votes to stop last week republicans said they were hoping to persuade four senators mark pryor and blanche l lincoln of arkansas both democrats and norm coleman of minnesota and gordon h smith of oregon both republicans to change their earlier stance and support drilling but the senators said through spokesmen that they remained opposed to drilling in the refuge the senator has said he would meet with both sides and the supporters gave him brochures but he has not been convinced said mr pryor 's spokesman rodell mollineau he said during the campaign that he did n't believe drilling was good for the environment or would meet our national energy needs and that has n't changed roger herrera a consultant for arctic power a pro drilling lobbying group financed by the state of alaska and oil companies said that he did not believe that the fight was over and that supporters might have more backers than opponents realized but two leading republican supporters of drilling senators pete v domenici of new mexico and ted stevens of alaska canceled a news conference today to announce their strategy for winning the measure 's approval and aides said there were no plans to reschedule it

 two partner households may not necessarily be better for poor children than single parent households researchers from johns hopkins have found the finding sounded a cautionary note today in the debate over what the government should do in the next welfare law to promote marriage in a study of 2100 poor families in three cities the hopkins researchers examine a trend that has been widely considered to be good news a small but noticeable increase in recent years in the percentage of low income children growing up in two parent households the researchers found that in poor neighborhoods in boston chicago and san antonio this was indeed the case the percentage of children living with a single mother declined from 57 percent in the first interview to 54 percent in follow up studies 16 months later but about two thirds of these new two adult households were people living together not married the researchers wrote virtually all of the cohabitating and marriage that began during the 16 months of the studies involved a mother and a man who was not the child 's biological father the percentage of children living with both biological parents did not increase only a fifth of the children in the study lived with married biological parents moreover both the marriages and the live in relationships proved fragile of the couples who were living together at the start of the study 42 percent had broken up 16 months later while 16 percent had married of the mothers who were married at the start 18 percent had separated 16 months later such churning can have serious consequences for children said andrew j cherlin an author of the study the sheer number of transitions children undergo in their living arrangements can cause serious problems mr cherlin added we conclude if our study is at all representative that poor children in central cities will probably not benefit as much from the trend toward two parent families as we might think said mr cherlin who is the griswold professor of public policy at hopkins there is a place for some promotion of two parent families in welfare reform he added but i think we ought to hold the line and not allow it to overwhelm the rest of the bill mr cherlin suggested that government marriage programs might want to focus on biological parents who have recently had a child the hopkins study was financed by several foundations and federal agencies it was presented today at a welfare forum in washington the bush administration has already proposed 100 million a year to finance experimental programs in the states to encourage marriage among low income people

 q our building manager recently sent our board a roundup of the myriad signs that must be posted in our six story co op our intimate building which has done fine for 75 years without these notices is beginning to resemble a hotel with all this signage is there no distinction between a 24 unit building and a large apartment building regarding these signs susan j trammell manhattan a james g samson a manhattan real estate lawyer said that under current federal state and new york city law as many as 32 different signs may have to be posted in residential multiple dwellings in the city new york city alone requires as many as 20 different signs mr samson said explaining that different regulations require different signs to be posted at different locations some are near the front door some are in the lobby some are near the mailboxes and some are in the hallways and landings he said in fact he said a recent signage requirement imposed by the city makes landlords responsible for ensuring that a fire emergency instruction placard is affixed on the inside entrance door of every apartment in a multiple dwelling he said the reason the managing agent is making the board aware of the requirements is probably because a building owner or a co op or condominium association can be fined for failing to post a required sign penalties can range anywhere from 10 for failure to post the janitor 's residence sign to several thousand dollars a day for failure to display a petroleum bulk storage registration certificate near the heating oil tank he said adding that the city 's administrative code does not provide a way for smaller multiple dwellings to get a waiver or exemption and since approaching state and federal agencies for an exemption will likely be time consuming and probably futile he said compliance is usually a lot easier landlord billing for uncollected rent q i live in a 60 unit apartment house and am a rent stabilized tenant several years ago several tenants filed a rent reduction claim against our landlord because there were several violations in the building after many hearings and appeals the division of housing and community renewal ultimately reduced our rent since that time the landlord has accepted my reduced rent checks and renewed my lease however he has continued to bill me for what the rent would have been if there had n't been a reduction he now shows a past due rent of over 13000 my question is when i die is my estate responsible for this back rent sylvia abrams brooklyn a lucas a ferrara a manhattan lawyer who is an editor of the landlord tenant practice reporter a newsletter for lawyers said that based on the information provided the landlord would not be able to collect the so called past due rent mr ferrara said that when a landlord fails to provide essential or required services to a rent regulated tenant the state division of housing and community renewal has the power to issue an order reducing the tenant 's rent after the order is issued he said the landlord can not collect future rent increases until the agency restores the rent and any allowable increases since the landlord has renewed the lease while continuing to accept the letter writer 's reduced rent payments he said it is unlikely that the agency has issued an order restoring the original rent and increases 'it appears the tenant is being billed for the rent differential as if no reduction order has been in place he said and if that 's the case those moneys are not recoverable either from the tenant or her estate even if the state agency restores the previous rent he said it is not retroactive and the amount the landlord considers past due is not recoverable
 frank skala was driving down bell boulevard on his way to early mass on sept 1 when he saw it a 1000 pound bull lying in the street its horns tail and hind legs severed it lay in front of uncle jack 's steakhouse a neighborhood restaurant my first thought was 'somebody killed the bull said mr skala a local resident then he wondered how the perpetrators had gotten it to that spot it must have been an awfully strong force to move that there he said after all the bull was a 6 foot by 4 foot cast iron statue that had been bolted to the sidewalk in front of the restaurant on aug 23 william degel the owner of uncle jack 's paid 10000 for it it was symbol of power he said now if you look at it it looks dead he and some of his workers dragged the red orange statue back to the sidewalk he has vowed to repair and reinstall it this time on top of a large granite pedestal designed to withstand vandalistic assaults from the denizens of what he called the boulevard 's rowdy late night pub scene it has n't been easy a local ironworker offered to mend the bull free then changed his mind and said it would cost 1100 mr degel declined that offer another welder has offered to take the bull away for repair this weekend mr degel said that in the bull 's short public life it had already become a landmark people from all over were coming over and taking pictures of the bull sitting their children on it and taking pictures he said about two dozen local residents have taken part in a contest to name the bull first prize is a steak dinner with champagne the leading entry is chopper the bull 's butchers are still at large police officer santo elardo of the 111th precinct said there were neither witnesses nor suspects but the bull itself is in trouble with the law after a resident complained about it three weeks ago to the city 's department of transportation inspectors found that the statue had been installed without a permit keith kalb a department spokesman said the restaurant was sent a notice of encroachment a violation that can result in a fine of 50 to 500 on receiving it mr degel will have 30 days to apply for a permit and satisfy inspectors that the bull is not a safety hazard mr degel expects to obtain the permit he said because the bull is harmless after that he added we 're going to have a resurrection of the beast jim o'grady
 thousands of heart attack patients fail to take the most important action they can to increase their chances of survival calling 911 a study has found instead nearly half of the roughly 772000 americans who had heart attacks over a four year period studied either drove themselves to hospitals or had someone take them the report in the online version of circulation an american heart association journal will be published in the regular journal in january the researchers looked at heart attack cases across the country from 1994 to 1998 and found that emergency medical services were used only 53 percent of the time the consequences can be extremely serious warned the lead author dr john g canto of the university of alabama at birmingham since half the people who die from heart attacks do so within the first hour he said it is critical that they get the appropriate treatment as soon as possible advantages of using an ambulance start from its arrival and last even after the patient reaches the hospital dr canto said besides speeding patients to hospitals ambulance workers can resuscitate those whose hearts stop en route and can begin electrocardiograms and other tests that allow patients to avoid delays in the emergency room some treatments can begin in the ambulance compared with heart attack patients who drove themselves or got rides elsewhere those who arrived by ambulance received clot busting therapy 12 minutes faster and surgical intervention 31 minutes faster the study found

 should the owners of a company be allowed to have a say when a company hands out millions of stock options the owners of mentor graphics a software company decided this week that they wanted to be heard on the subject a shareholder proposal sponsored by the big institutional money manager tiaa cref won the support of 572 percent of stockholders according to the preliminary tally reached yesterday mentor is the first company whose shareholders have adopted such a resolution said patrick connor a spokesman for tiaa cref a mentor spokesman declined to say whether the company would comply with that proposal which is nonbinding it 's premature to talk about that the spokesman ryerson schwark said but we heard loud and clear what the shareholders said under current rules at both nasdaq where mentor is traded and the new york stock exchange companies do not need to submit most option plans for shareholder approval few companies allow such votes many companies have fought bitterly against efforts to change their rules contending that they need the flexibility to grant options quickly to attract or keep valuable employees companies could seek shareholder approval for plans that had such options available but many prefer not to mentor is unusual in that it even allowed its owners to vote on the proposal which said that shareholders request the board of directors to submit all equity compensation plans and amendments to add shares to those plans for approval by the stockholders it did not have to do so the chairman of the securities and exchange commission harvey l pitt said last month that new rules were needed that would force companies to put to a vote of shareholders any plan that provides options to senior management he did not address whether all plans had to be voted on before the speech the sec 's corporation finance division had supported four companies that refused to allow their shareholders to vote on similar proposals from tiaa cref adobe systems cadence design systems autodesk and synopsys the sec concluded that option plans were compensation matters requiring no shareholder approval a spokeswoman for mr pitt christi harlan said last night that he would not comment on specific cases and she noted that tiaa cref had appealed the decision on the four companies but she said that in mr pitt 's opinion in general on compensation issues letting shareholders have a vote is in the best interests of the company and management ms harlan added that mr pitt would not vote on the appeal because tiaa cref had been a client of his when he was a lawyer in private practice before joining the commission under the former sec chairman arthur levitt the commission tried and failed to persuade the stock markets to require more shareholder votes on options the cost of stock options is a contentious one in many ways the tiaa cref proposal noted that in 2000 mentor graphics granted options on 47 million shares more than 7 percent of the outstanding shares during the year it said shareholders should be consulted when there was a possibility of substantial dilution of their stakes in urging shareholders to reject the proposal mentor said there had been little dilution it noted that the average exercise price of options issued during the year was 1736 and that it had reduced the possibility of dilution by repurchasing three million shares of common stock at an average price of 1762 not much higher than the option price mentor did not note that in 2001 its share repurchases cost 2447 a share 21 percent more than the 2020 exercise price of the options it issued nor did it note that the options actually exercised in each year options that had been issued in previous years were at prices far below the price the company paid to buy back shares in trading yesterday mentor rose 69 cents to 1812 companies that try to buy back shares to offset their stock options do reduce the risk of dilution but at a cost if the share price does not rise the options will never be exercised and the company will have paid for shares at prices that turn out to be high even if the options are eventually exercised the company will have put out cash in the intervening years but to shareholder democracy advocates the matter is not whether options are a good idea it is whether the owners of a company should have a voice on the matter as it stands now the sec has ruled that companies do not have to allow even advisory votes

 the stock market is doing great honest just look at a recent crop of mutual fund advertisements check out the ad in the dec 4 issue of barron 's the one with the eight guys in sweats doing push ups on a football field with the stern headline american discipline according to the ad the american century vista fund which invests heavily in technology stocks had a 12 month return of 1081 percent imagine that no sign here of all that doomsday claptrap about technology stocks then there is the t rowe price science technology fund which according to a recent ad in business week had a 12 month return of 384 percent the 19 billion fidelity aggressive growth fund up 493 percent according to a recent ad in this and other newspapers scudder 21st century growth up 406 percent a bear market what bear market the stock market may be in general decline but everything is still blooming in the land of mutual fund marketers their message this holiday season is simple try to remember the end of september or at least what your 12 month mutual fund returns were back then and try to forget that the standard poor 's 500 index is down 68 percent so far this year fund companies defend their advertisements by pointing to securities and exchange commission rules that require them to include in their performance advertising their 1  5  and 10 year returns through the end of a fund 's most recent quarter but cynthia m fornelli a senior adviser to the head of the sec 's investment management division said the agency was considering changes in its rules maybe it 's not enough to rely on the last quarter of performance numbers if something extraordinary happens in the interim that makes those numbers misleading ms fornelli said i would remind people that there is currently an anti fraud provision in our rules that may require such updating the national association of securities dealers which reviews fund ads to make sure that they comply with the sec rules and its own has issued two additional guidelines in 1999 it said that more performance data might be necessary if the fund 's performance suffers materially after the end of the most recent quarter an official said last week that the guideline was meant more for catastrophes like the impact of a currency devaluation on an emerging markets fund than for market corrections this year it added a recommendation if a fund 's recent performance was the result of its investment focus in an unusually 'hot industry or other factors that may not continue to exist the association said in a notice we believe members should include prominent cautionary language fidelity and american century note that in recent weeks they have added stronger caveats to the usual past performance is no guarantee of future results in their fine print current performance may be lower than performance stated the fidelity advertisement says t rowe price however disagrees with the nasd 's 1999 guideline the nasd notice is just a recommendation said jane white a spokeswoman we have discussed it with them at length and disagree with them we use the sec guideline because the markets have been down this year especially since september adjusting the one year returns through the date the ads actually appeared yields a bleak picture t rowe price science technology was down 129 percent american century vista was up 149 percent far below the triple digit gains in the ad scudder kemper 21st century growth was down 042 percent fidelity aggressive growth meanwhile was down 412 percent fidelity 's nov 20 ad also lists the fund 's top five star ranking from morningstar inc but try to catch a falling star by the time the ad appeared morningstar had downgraded the fund to four stars neal litvak president of fidelity 's retail marketing division regretted the disparity that would not be my preference to have that happen he said since then he said fidelity ads besides adding stronger caveats have moved away from emphasizing individual funds we 're trying now to modify those performance ads so they show a wider range of products mr litvak said they show small numbers as well as big numbers at least fidelity t rowe price scudder kemper and american century include fine print then there is dow jones publisher of the wall street journal and barron 's in several recent ads in the journal the company promotes its dow jones industrial average and the 19 different companies and exchanges that sell mutual funds and other products tracking the average for which dow jones collects licensing fees the ad calls the average an unbeatable equation with an extraordinary return and encourages investors to contact your financial sales professional the prominently displayed numbers including a 2522 percent one year return are impressive but the ad has no fine print that says when the return was posted when the ad appeared on dec 4 the dow was down 57 percent over the previous 52 weeks if you guessed that the advertised return was through the end of september you would be wrong it was from the 1999 calendar year because it is not a fund company dow jones is not subject to the same regulatory standards but besides using a favorable period to calculate returns mercer bullard a former lawyer for the sec 's investment management division said the ad neglected to take into account the fund fees that would reduce performance mr bullard who now runs fund democracy a fund shareholder advocacy group said that if he was still at the sec i would refer it to an enforcement liaison he said that while it would not be easy to establish the sec 's jurisdiction in the sec 's favor this is a very misleading ad richard tofel a dow jones spokesman said that despite its note to call one 's financial adviser the ad was not truly aimed at individuals the ad is soliciting people to offer such funds not people to invest in such funds he said pointing out that the message at the bottom of the ad invites investment companies to arrange licensing some fund companies show more current results in a recent ad warburg pincus listed its capital appreciation fund with a 452 percent one year return through

 when richard a grasso the chairman of the new york stock exchange said last year that the big board was considering a backup trading floor at a nuclear distance from new york city it was treated as an ill phrased gaffe but after last week 's power failure that blanketed an area stretching from the northeast to the midwest companies are taking a harder look at whether their disaster recovery plans go far enough literally the geographic dispersion of this event really causes some rethinking for companies said jim simmons the chief executive of sungard availability services a company in wayne pa that runs disaster recovery centers for about 10000 clients in north america and europe many companies that tried to manage their own disaster recovery plans he said found on aug 14 that the backup site they had created was still within the blackout area he said customers told him gee i never thought it would be out on long island and out in new jersey but even having backup centers hundreds of miles away might not have helped he said since the blackout zone extended into the midwest and canada the education coming out of this disaster is you ca n't predict a disaster he said companies like his ensure that the data is there and desks are there for clients who pay anything from a few hundred dollars a month to a million dollars a month for some companies he said minutes of downtime can cost millions of dollars so many companies look to services from companies like sungard and ibm to handle that side of the business for them they can create disaster hardened backup offices even if they happen to fall within the blackout zone ready to go on short notice and linked directly to their computer networks in ways that ensure against any loss of important information and little if any interruption of business transactions having operations distributed across the nation is an old and honored strategy for companies with big call centers said gary morgenstern a spokesman for att when a call center in new york goes down he said that traffic is automatically routed to the west coast and the flow of commerce continues but for many companies setting up redundant operations in far flung places can be expensive said don demarco vice president for business continuity and recovery services at ibm and the probabilities are fairly low that a true test of such preparations will ever come i can only think of one or two clients in the past couple of months he said who have told us they want substantial geographical separation between their operations centers every single company should decide what their tolerance for risk is he said the thriftier strategy makes sense until a big problem like the blackout occurs if they need it it 's sure nice to know it 's there he said more and more the choice is not theirs to make government regulations of financial industries for example increasingly require substantial efforts aimed at ensuring stability in an emergency and in many cases customers are demanding to see proof that a business is ready for trouble before they will award it a major contract or place a company within its supply chain of manufacturing he said today he said risk involves the whole ecosystem of commerce still despite last week 's big scare new customers have not started banging down the doors said john shields executive vice president of telehouse a data center and disaster recovery company in new york that works largely with the financial services industries employees of sumitomo bank a client walked from their midtown manhattan offices to the telehouse offices near wall street and found a building with the lights still on and the air conditioning still working but it will take time for many companies to evaluate their disaster planning before deciding whether they want to follow in sumitomo 's footsteps the fallout takes a little while to get organized he said current customers of so called business continuity and disaster recovery firms however are already talking about increasing the scope of their contracts said richard fleischman founder of a disaster recovery firm in new york that bears his name i 'd say 75 percent of them he said have requested additional facilities and additional service that is not surprising but it is not always the case mr demarco of ibm said that some customers learn from experience but seem to learn the wrong lesson he described a corporate client that survived a major flood with the help of his company 's disaster recovery services and then declined to renew its contract for the next year mr demarco said he was aghast are you kidding he recalled asking we just saved your company the client however was unmoved we 're in a hundred year flood zone mr demarco recalled him saying and it just happened
 nato is getting bigger but what 's it for this november the north atlantic treaty organization now an alliance of 19 countries is likely to expand by another 6 or 7 in what the bush administration has called a robust enlargement after the bitter debate in the senate and elsewhere over the last enlargement to the east in 1999 the lack of controversy now is deafening for many in washington the silence has an easy explanation after sept 11 this pact for cold war containment does not really matter any more at least not as a military alliance central to america 's global tasks the old enemy moscow chose after sept 11 to be more of a friend if less than an ally so what should nato become or should it simply pass into history its job well done no one wants to kill nato and there are serious efforts under way to transform it to make it quicker more mobile more precise and more effective even as it enlarges to complete the reunification of europe and develops a new relationship with russia at a meeting in iceland this week secretary of state colin l powell dismissed talk of nato irrelevance saying it 's very hard to close down when people are standing in line to get in many europeans agree nato must remain the centerpiece of trans atlantic security policy said friedbert pfluger a christian democratic member of parliament here that requires the europeans to become militarily stronger but the americans must understand that making nato irrelevant is a bad idea for washington too but secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld is said to have been unimpressed with the alliance when he served as ambassador to nato in 1973 74 douglas j feith the under secretary of defense for policy has joked about nato keep the myth alive with president bush preparing to give a major speech about europe and nato here next thursday the often quarrelsome officials of the state and defense departments are quarreling now over what he should say there is a lot of cynicism in washington over whether the european allies will ever spend enough money to live up to their commitments and keep nato relevant to american needs european officials are trying to influence the debate knowing that they can not defend the continent without nato and worrying that if washington treats the alliance as irrelevant the european motivation to spend more on defense will evaporate our fear is that the us could use nato to keep a foot in europe but make it militarily irrelevant and use it as some kind of toolbox from which to take the parts you want for any mission mr pfluger said the arguments boil down to what role an enlarged nato should play should it be modernized to remain the main instrument for projecting military power for the united states and its allies or should it take on the serious but less compelling mission of being a sort of political talking shop that can help democratize the rest of europe stabilize the balkans modernize central asia and bring the russians into a serious collaborative relationship with the west for much of the pentagon the lessons of the 1999 kosovo war nato 's first and the fight against the taliban and al qaeda are simple the united states is best off fighting its global battles itself without the complications of a formal alliance but with some help from a coalition of the able the british a few others like the french and germans who can help fill in the gaps or later keep the peace on the ground in this view enlargement is essentially political and does not matter because neither washington nor moscow regard nato as militarily significant any longer the gap in military spending and capability between the united states and the rest of nato has been growing so large as to make nato seem irrelevant the alliance 's secretary general lord robertson is disappointed that the european allies did not use the events of sept 11 to rally their populations around the need to spend more on the military the choice for europe he has said is modernization or marginalization lord robertson is pressing for a modernized nato with a global reach the nato toolbox will be big including rapid reaction forces he said in an interview and i personally will resist people taking individual tools from that box as some in the pentagon would like to do nato 's credibility depends on its military capability lord robertson who met with mr bush in april said his view was winning in washington but he and senior american officials believe they must work to present a positive picture of what nato will be nato has been considered dead before but it found a new post soviet role in the balkans in bosnia kosovo and macedonia but this probably delayed a fundamental examination of what nato stands for there is no question that this is a defining transformational year for nato said the american ambassador to the alliance r nicholas burns richard c holbrooke a former ambassador to germany and to the united nations said nato is our strategic presence in europe it is indispensable to our own national security for political logistical and military reasons even the world 's greatest superpower ca n't go it alone after sept 11 a senior administration official said nato has gone global committing to operations outside europe and dealing with new contingencies and threats lord robertson and other nato officials set out several military goals for the leaders who will meet in prague beyond enlargement and russia the meeting should focus on strategic lift to get troops out of europe by air on rapid reaction forces on more precision guided munitions on better air to air refueling capacity on secure communications that are alliancewide and on establishing missile defenses even then the question of what nato is for remains fuzzy said ronald d asmus a former deputy assistant secretary of state for europe in the 1990 's the question was whether you could stabilize the rest of europe the east and the balkans without a train wreck with russia he said today having largely succeeded in that and now after 9 11 the question is can the united states and europe come up with a common strategy to deal with this new challenge of the greater middle east if nato does n't address the central strategic issue of our time which is terrorism weapons of mass destruction and the remaking of the middle east it will cease to be america 's premier alliance editors note may 31 2002 friday an article on may 19 about the future of nato particularly after its expansion next fall discussed whether the alliance is still relevant it quoted a joke said to be making the rounds in washington keep the myth alive and attributed the remark to douglas j feith under secretary of defense for policy associates of mr feith said he had been overheard making the remark but the times should have asked him about it he says he has never uttered those words or anything of the kind and stresses that he is a supporter of nato considering the alliance crucial to the security of the democracies of europe and north america

 a top adviser to gov george e pataki is also a lobbyist who has pressed the governor 's office for legislation in an unusual situation that critics of mr pataki and of new york 's lobbying practices say raises ethical concerns john f o'mara who once served as mr pataki 's chief utility regulator is a lawyer the governor has hired as his lead negotiator with new york 's indian tribes on their land claims against the state and their attempts to open casinos he also heads the panel that screens judicial nominees for mr pataki at the same time mr o'mara is lobbying the administration he formed a partnership in august with former senator alfonse m d'amato to lobby for a project sought by a central new york shopping mall developer the effort paid off as the project was included in the broad gambling law enacted last month that included approval for up to six indian casinos former representative bill paxon plays a similar though less direct dual role he lobbies in washington for mr pataki 's request for federal aid to recover from the world trade center attack and for the state university of new york an agency controlled by the governor at the same time he and his law firm represent the seneca indians in their casino and land claim talks with the governor 's office mr paxon has said that he is not directly involved in those negotiations though he played a role in lobbying the legislature on behalf of the senecas in favor of the gambling bill such arrangements violate no laws or regulations legal codes of ethics say that as long as a lawyer 's clients are aware of potential conflicts between them and waive any objections the lawyer is free to represent people whose interests may be opposed new york state 's lobbying law says nothing about conflicts of interest i 've looked into it thoroughly and there is no conflict mr o'mara said i have been very careful in my professional life to avoid any improprieties when there was any question i have gotten opinions from the state ethics commission in advance which i 've done several times but groups that press for more open government and more stringent ethics laws have long complained of the potential conflicts affecting lobbyists particularly those who pass through the revolving door between government and those who ask things of government those groups and some democrats say the situation of mr o'mara and mr paxon representing the governor while seeking things from the governor on behalf of paying clients is a disturbing wrinkle this is a new layer in the chronic conflict of interest problems in albany said rachel leon executive director of the new york chapter of common cause it just seems like simple basic ethics and common sense that you should n't be lobbying the governor at the same time you 're working for him critics say the arrangement raises the question of whether mr pataki can drive as hard a bargain as he should with a lobbyist who is also his representative i think it creates huge potential conflicts for the governor said blair horner legislative director for the new york public interest research group others have gone through the revolving door but o'mara is the doorway he 's both in and he 's out michael mckeon mr pataki 's communications director used an expletive to describe such remarks what you 're saying is you 're not questioning o'mara 's ethics you 're questioning the governor 's ethics he said he dismissed mr horner and ms leon as surrogates for the democrats saying that their criticism of the republican governor was the worst kind of politics attacking people 's integrity as for whether mr o'mara 's dual role gave him any particular advantage in dealing with mr pataki mr keon said the governor has no problem saying no to anybody mr o'mara is a longtime republican power a former district attorney and judge in chemung county who for more than two decades has been close to mr d'amato who was once the governor 's political mentor mr pataki appointed mr o'mara chairman of the state 's public service commission which regulates utilities from which he swept away much of the long standing system of utility monopolies before leaving it in 1998 niagara mohawk one of the utilities mr o'mara used to regulate retains him as a lobbyist in august mr o'mara and mr d'amato in a partnership called d and o consultants were hired by pyramid management group a part of the pyramid companies a developer of shopping malls and other projects which is based in syracuse pyramid 's primary owner robert congel is a major political contributor who since 1995 has given 94900 to the state republican party 15500 to mr pataki and large sums to several other candidates republican and democratic pyramid intends to build a 13 billion expansion of its carousel center mall in syracuse making it the largest mall in the country the plans call for a number of features like a sports complex and an aquarium that would make the mall as much amusement park and tourist destination as shopping center pyramid wanted the state to build inside the mall a high tech center to promote upstate tourism and to create a new upstate tourism council to be based there the center would resemble a theme park with scale models of various tourist spots and interactive computer displays the company hired mr o'mara and mr d'amato to lobby the pataki administration for the 25 million project and patricia lynch a former top aide to speaker sheldon silver to lobby the assembly the tourism center and council were included in the gambling bill along with other unrelated projects that might not have won passage on their own the legislature passed the bill last month and the governor signed it

 the head of the drug enforcement administration testified today that he believed that the aggressive promotion of the painkiller oxycontin by its maker had played a role in its widespread abuse in comments before the house subcommittee on the departments of commerce justice and state the judiciary and related agencies the administrator of the drug agency asa hutchinson said that purdue pharma the manufacturer of oxycontin had contributed to its disproportionate abuse by aggressively marketing it as less prone to abuse than similar drugs dr paul d goldenheim a top executive of purdue pharma which is based in stamford conn vehemently disputed any suggestion that the company had inappropriately marketed the drug today 's hearing came as lawmakers grappled with how to prevent powerful narcotics like oxycontin from falling into the wrong hands the time released drug is a valuable medication in the treatment of cancer and other types of chronic pain but drug abusers quickly learned that the drug could provide a heroin like high the drug agency has identified oxycontin as a likely factor in 296 overdose deaths since january 2000 mr hutchinson said that the company had taken steps to address some of his concerns representative frank r wolf republican of virginia said today that he would ask the general accounting office the investigative arm of congress to conduct a study of how purdue pharma marketed the drug all those who testified today said they supported a far broader use of electronic systems that can help identify people who seek to fill unusually high numbers of prescriptions or doctors who write disproportionately large numbers of them at today 's hearing dr goldenheim also came under questioning by representative harold rogers republican of kentucky about an article on monday in the new york times that reported that purdue pharma did little if anything after salesmen were told by some pharmacists and a law enforcement official that doctors at a pain management clinic in myrtle beach sc were suspected of inappropriately or excessively prescribing oxycontin mr rogers pressed dr goldenheim on why the company had not investigated a clinic where those questions were raised given that the company 's own sales data showed that the first quarter growth of oxycontin sales in the myrtle beach area this year were significantly higher than its growth during that period in other parts of the country dr goldenheim the company 's executive vice president for research development and regulatory and medical affairs said that purdue pharma had distributed brochures to pharmacists describing how to identify individuals seeking to abuse prescription drugs he also said that the company understood that some pharmacists in south carolina had already contacted law enforcement officials who were investigating the clinic mr rogers was not satisfied your company did nothing and people were dying he said dr goldenheim replied that the company had never done anything to cause its drug to be used improperly and that there was little it could do to control the actions of doctors we do n't control what they prescribe dr goldenheim said we ca n't stop them from prescribing our product mr rogers paused briefly and said we can
 the house at 19 gramercy park south with its strikingly elegant 1880 's interiors was called by the late critic brendan gill the greatest private house remaining in private hands in new york the house was recently put on the market as a stanford white house in part because mr gill had attributed part of it to the famed architect and the asking price is 18 million but what scant documentary evidence there is while certainly not conclusive suggests that the house was not by white but by another architect who shared white 's offices raising the question of just how much a stanford white attribution is worth especially to an already grand building gramercy park was opened in the 1840 's as an expensive residential enclave where the householders were given keys to the central garden kept locked to outsiders in 1845 william samuel johnson a whig politician built a simple brick house numbered 19 on the southeast corner of irving place and gramercy park south johnson lived in the house until 1850 when he sold it to a paper merchant horace brooks brooks built a stable on the lot to the south now demolished and in 1866 added a mansard fifth story to the house by the 1880 's census records show a variety of families at that address as if the house had been informally converted to apartments it was purchased in 1887 by the financier stuyvesant fish son of hamilton fish a former new york governor in may 1887 stuyvesant fish at age 36 became president of the illinois central railroad and in june his architect filed plans to alter what by that time was an old house the alterations were mostly interior delivering to mr fish and his wife marian nicknamed mame an attractive series of rooms some of which have survived later remodeling the low ceilinged first floor has a wide reception area of painted paneling with two rooms to the left at the corner is an exquisite intimate corner study with sophisticated oak paneling a fine fireplace and a carved chimney breast and also a half paneled dining room with sliding doors up a sensuously modeled staircase the second floor has a white painted central room with columns and unusual classical detailing early and elaborate for 1887 when american architecture was still in the thrall of the richardsonian romanesque in 1979 mr gill wrote in the new yorker that the fish house was designed by white reflecting a strong oral tradition that the famed partner in mckim mead white was in charge white 's house no longer standing was just across gramercy park at lexington avenue the fishes later house at 78th street and madison avenue was definitely designed by white and mckim mead white did render a bill to the fishes for work on the gramercy park south house but the internal records were marked check to stratton most of the firm 's surviving records are at the new york historical society indeed both the alteration permit at the department of buildings and the real estate record guide a trade journal list the architect as sidney v stratton not mckim mead white stratton is now a little known designer but he was one of the first american students at the ecole des beaux arts in paris along with h h richardson and richard morris hunt after the ecole stratton worked for hunt and went out on his own in the 1870 's he designed the queen anne style house school of industry at 120 west 16th street several country houses and the green alcove a gemlike portion of an older room now at the new york society library at 53 east 79th street mosette broderick a lecturer in the urban design program at nyu who has studied the work of both stratton and mckim mead white extensively says that stratton met charles mckim at the ecole sublet space from the firm in 1877 and developed an unusual arrangement from the early 1880 's to about 1889 stratton was listed on the firm 's letterhead but underneath the partners names and separated from them by a line mrs broderick says that in the early 1880 's stratton was much better connected to new york society than were charles mckim william mead or white that they used stratton to gain access to that world but he pursued and designed commissions independently she says that there may have been some interplay between the architects but that there no reason to consider this commission as by anyone but stratton further evidence bolsters that thesis stuyvesant fish 's brother nicholas altered a house at 53 irving place also in 1887 there was a mckim mead white bill for this work too but for the brother 's house the alteration permit was taken out in the name of mckim mead white not in the name of stratton mrs broderick 's view is not shared by the architect samuel g white author of the houses of mckim mead white rizzoli 1998 the office was so small everyone was working together says mr white a great grandson of stanford white and a partner at buttrick white burtis mr white thinks there is a high likelihood of design collaboration and stratton 's presence makes this more interesting than the run of the mill house by the firm he says the fishes remained at 19 gramercy park south until 1898 when they asked white to build an entirely new house at 78th and madison in 1909 a six story apartment building was added on the south end of the gramercy park lot and the complex was operated as a multiple dwelling cecilia beaux a prominent portrait painter lived there in the 1910 's and norman thomas was living there in 1944 when he ran on the socialist party ticket for president by that time the publicist benjamin sonnenberg was a resident and within a few years he bought the entire structure mr sonnenberg combined the old fish house and the apartment building to make a single vast private house of 35 rooms and added some magnificent interiors of his own like the second floor drawing room facing gramercy park with 17th century english paneling when the sonnenberg family put the house up for sale in 1979 the white attribution was used it had stuck the current owners the fashion designer richard tyler and his wife lisa trafficante bought it in 1995 for 35 million according to their broker leslie mason of douglas elliman ms mason has incorporated much of mr gill 's eloquent description of the house into sales literature including his white attribution ms mason says she does n't think the questioning of the attribution to white will harm the sale of such a building other brokers agree john foreman a vice president at the halstead property company said that if there 's a sophisticated buyer an attribution to white may incline them toward buying but that does n't mean the value of the house is increased and leslie j garfield head of the brokerage firm that bears his name said i do n't think the attribution adds anything at that price level people do n't care who the architect is they 're buying a house on gramercy park

 treasury secretary john w snow and his chinese counterparts agreed today that china should eventually allow its currency to trade freely on international markets but beijing rejected calls to move quickly in that direction saying it might cause financial instability in china and abroad mr snow faces political pressure to push china to raise the value of its currency the yuan some democratic presidential candidates and industry groups have argued that china keeps the currency deliberately undervalued to promote exports to america which they say has caused job losses in the united states last year china had the largest trade surplus with the united states of any country 103 billion though it runs a modest global trade surplus mr snow left china today after a two day visit without a specific timetable for addressing the currency issue but he said chinese officials assured him that they would take interim steps to loosen restrictions on the country 's tightly controlled financial system on the currency issue in particular i was encouraged to hear a reaffirmation of china 's longstanding goal to move toward greater flexibility mr snow said i was assured that interim policy steps are now being taken and progress in this area will continue china 's central bank governor zhou xiaochuan struck a conciliatory tone with mr snow in lengthy comments released by state media he promised that the value of the yuan would eventually be determined by market forces rather than being fixed at 83 to the dollar as it has been for almost a decade mr zhou also outlined a variety of measures that he said would allow the market to play a bigger role in china 's financial system among them are new regulations to allow foreigners to invest in yuan denominated securities and corresponding rules that allow some domestic investors to buy securities abroad mr snow said the discussion also included ways to make it easier for chinese individuals and companies to buy american stocks and bonds helping to recycle some of china 's export earnings into american investments mr zhou said china planned to encourage companies to invest more overseas exporters will also soon be allowed to keep more of the foreign currency they earn which could prompt them to import more goods beijing also announced new rules on the amount of foreign currency chinese tourists and business executives can take on trips abroad finally mr zhou also said for the first time that china would consider revising the pegged currency system to link the yuan to other currencies as well as the dollar because the dollar has declined against many other currencies this year any such move to link the yuan to a broader basket of currencies could prompt at least a modest rise in the value of the yuan against the dollar chinese state media have trumpeted the decision to stick by the currency system at least for now as a sign that the government can resist what one newspaper called international browbeating if implemented fully the steps mr zhou outlined would amount to a concerted attempt to respond to record inflows of foreign currency to china without remaking the currency system some measures have been under consideration for weeks or months but the fact that they were highlighted during mr snow 's visit represented a clear effort to address american complaints and channel some of china 's recent financial gains into overseas markets analysts said china authorities are sensitive to the politics of this issue in the united states and want to be viewed as responding andy xie chief asia economist of morgan stanley said

 westchester county legislators scurried today to compile a list of recommended budget cuts one day before they are to vote on a proposed 286 percent increase in the county 's property tax collection one of the largest increases in its history in a two hour committee meeting here legislators recommended cutting at least 221 million from the 137 billion budget proposed last month by county executive andrew j spano those cuts would lower mr spano 's proposed increase in the property tax levy to about 22 percent the legislators said richard g wishnie chairman of the budget committee said he and other legislators planned to make many additional cuts when the entire 17 member board meets on friday we 're trying to keep the property taxes as low as possible he said everything 's on the table there 's nothing sacred here michael b kaplowitz a member of the budget committee said legislators had decided on a first round of cuts before facing more painful choices to come their recommendations include eliminating 80 vacant positions in county agencies in addition to the 229 vacant positions already targeted by mr spano the legislators also want to raise bus fares to 175 from 140 in order to maintain the current level of service mr spano has proposed raising the bus fare by slightly less and deleting some bus routes and stops mr spano a democrat who once pledged to reduce taxes initially called for a 317 percent increase in the county 's property tax levy to offset a projected 100 million budget gap next year but he later dropped that to 286 percent saying he had directed his staff to make more cuts after residents complained they could not afford the larger increase in westchester the county tax is only a share of the total property taxes on a home depending on the municipality county property taxes account for 15 percent to 20 percent of the average tax bill of a homeowner the remaining taxes pay for school districts as well as city town and village operations in television ads and news conferences this fall mr spano has repeatedly blamed state officials in albany for the county 's budget crisis saying that the property tax increase was necessary to offset the sharply rising costs in medicaid and other state mandated programs several westchester legislators said mr spano 's public attacks had strained relationships with state officials and compounded their budget problems it caused us to lose our focus said george oros the republican minority leader susan tolchin chief adviser to mr spano said the county executive felt that people should know why he would have to raise the property taxes next year it 's a very difficult year because of the state mandates she said westchester officials received a setback this week when the state legislature adjourned for the rest of the year without taking up the county 's request for permission to increase the sales tax by one percentage point next year westchester now has a 675 percent sales tax outside the cities of mount vernon new rochelle white plains and yonkers which already impose sales taxes ranging from 775 percent to 825 percent county legislators have included 91 million in anticipated revenue from a sales tax increase into their budget calculations and it was unclear today how they planned to get that money
 her voice can be like smoke velvet or acid it sobs whispers and seduces with the raw emotional daring of edith piaf 's by turns tender and defiant her singing is so expressive that you do n't need to understand the portuguese words to comprehend the bitter experience and pain this is misia and on her third cd ritual released by erato last month this portuguese singer demonstrates why she is gaining an international following for her passionate interpretations of fado the traditional song of her country on saturday night misia comes to the society for ethical culture on the upper west side her third appearance in new york she performs with an ensemble of guitars acoustic bass and violin led by ricardo dias on piano and accordion fado from the portugese word for fate is a kind of melancholic song about loss and the force of destiny it arose in the bars and brothels of lisbon during the early 19th century the roughly 100 fado melodies can be sung to traditional lyrics or as with the blues performed with new words in lisbon fado is presented in restaurants or clubs called fado houses in stylized performances the singer man or woman dresses in black and stands unmoving as if conducting a mystic rite i do n't go onto the stage to cry my own tears misia said in a recent telephone conversation in english from her home in lisbon i do that in my kitchen with my cats and my plants i try to do something transcendent to transmit the pain of men and women of humanity after the revolution of the carnations in portugal in 1974 which led to the overthrow of the military government fado was identified with the political right and fell out of fashion over the last two decades it has regained its place in portuguese culture fado 's international reputation is largely the legacy of the singer amalia rodrigues known as the queen of fado who popularized the form until her death in 1999 while misia was acquainted with rodrigues she maintained a respectful distance from her so as not to seem to curry favor everywhere i go everybody knows what fado is thanks to amalia misia said for me she was a muse and inspiration she had that wonderful voice she inspired many new fados and she wrote beautiful lyrics herself misia credits the song lagrima tear with words by rodrigues as her inspiration to sing fado she recorded the song in 1993 and rerecorded it for her latest cd another tribute to rodrigues on the album is xaile de silencio the shawl of silence while in london for performances misia received the song 's lyrics from its writer mario cladio who sent them by fax on the day rodrigues died misia asked the guitarist carlos goncalves who accompanied rodrigues and wrote the music for tear to compose new music for the memorial song the lyrics evoke the legacy of rodrigues as well as the spirit of fado singing what a shawl of silence you left us  what a strange way of living  oh voice that burns in the shadow thorn and stem  handkerchief beckoning at each dusk born in the northern city of oporto as susana aguiar she assumed her stage name after reading a biography of misia sert the muse of parisian artists of the early 1900 's but used the portuguese accent misia 's mother is a classical spanish dancer from barcelona and her maternal grandmother was a singer in music halls misia refuses to divulge her age but judging from her own biography she appears to be around 40 it was only after moving to barcelona at the age of 20 and living there for some years that misia felt the yearnings for the music of portugal she returned to lisbon a decade ago since i come from an artistic family i feel the most safe on the stage of a theater misia said my psychiatrist said i have made the perfect choice for myself because the stage is where i can be me with all my intensity i can go from being a mythologic goddess to being bambi like astor piazzolla and ravi shankar who were opposed by musical conservatives when they made innovations in tango and indian classical music respectively misia has been criticized for straying from tradition in the beginning everyone said i am not a fadista misia said referring to the title bestowed on fado singers considered authentic but who is the khomeini of fado who can say that one musical innovation she made was to add instruments like the piano to the standard accompaniment of portuguese guitars she also incorporated accordion and violin because as a child she first learned fado tunes by listening to street musicians who played those instruments for her lyrics she made a radical departure by commissioning poems from portugal 's esteemed novelists and poets including the nobel laureate jose saramago most of the writers had never written lyrics before and were initially hesitant to enter the proscribed world of fado misia recorded the songs on her albums garras dos sentidos and paixoes diagonais and the high quality of the lyrics attracted a more literary audience even her appearance was subject to criticism in the photographs on her cd 's she looks like the young anais nin dressed in the latest designer fashions this glamorous image did not accord with how a fado singer usually appears which misia described as a nice lady in a skirt but finally they have accepted me and now the younger generation is putting on the same clothes i wear she said at first change is like a sin or sacrilege then it becomes normal and finally it becomes tradition despite her success misia continues to haunt the fado houses of lisbon which range from tourist traps to neighborhood pubs she favors clube de fado and tasca do careca bald man tavern where she meets friends for dinner and occasionally sings everywhere she goes she says people have called her the successor to rodrigues but she does not need me to be her successor because she is not dead misia said her music will always be alive misia society for ethical culture 2 west 64th street manhattan saturday 7 pm music correction july 11 2002 thursday an article in arts leisure on sunday about the portuguese fado singer misia and a pop jazz listing in the section misstated the time of her concert

 this is how richard fitzgerald a private chauffeur who lives in greenwich village described his feelings about some of the mayoral candidates in late august three weeks before the scheduled primary i like mark green the best he is sort of a voice for the people and on michael r bloomberg the republican candidate i think he 's paying his place on the ticket i do n't think he 's earned a place in politics this is what richard fitzgerald says now three weeks after the attack on the world trade center i think bloomberg may be tougher on terrorists right now being that he is a real businessman i think he is the one to protect and rebuild this city i 've become selfish i know but i do n't want to die in this city because of a crazy terrorist and so it goes a week before a democratic runoff that will pit mr green against fernando ferrer the bronx borough president there is much soul searching and hand wringing in greenwich village soho tribeca chelsea and battery park city overwhelmingly white mostly middle class neighborhoods that make up the 66th assembly district it is not the first time that voters in this district a democratic stronghold are reacting to political events in unexpected ways in 1997 more than half voted for mayor rudolph w giuliani even though four years earlier the majority of them had flatly rejected him now with thousands of bodies entombed in the rubble of the world trade center a few blocks from their homes voters in this district may be gearing up to help rearrange the city 's political map once again some voters who used to despise mr giuliani who has said he would like to extend his term by three months now love him for his command of the city after the collapse of the twin towers some who voted for mr green in the primary are ditching him for mr ferrer because they like how mr ferrer stood up to mr giuliani 's pressures to prolong his mandate and still others like mr fitzgerald who had rarely ever voted republican are inclined to vote for mr bloomberg because they say he is the only one with the business experience to resurrect lower manhattan from the ashes i have been exposed to bloomberg because my boss is very big in the city said mr fitzgerald who declined to identify his boss other than to say he is a billionaire who often has private chats with the city 's movers and shakers from the back of his car i meet and drive a lot of powerful men and they talk you always pretend not to hear not to pay attention but you ca n't help it and what mr fitzgerald has heard he said has made him think mr bloomberg should be mayor we need to focus on rebuilding the city not on helping the poor people mr fitzgerald said the bombing completely changed everything but i ca n't say what i 'll do for sure until i get into the booth again louis k meisel a soho art dealer and historian knows just what he will do once inside the voting booth he has made up his mind to vote for mr bloomberg even though in the primary he voted for mr green the priority now is rebuilding and putting the city back together he said we need a republican and a businessman to run the city someone who wo n't bow down to the demands of every single ethnic and political group complaining that they are being excluded mr meisel who has lived in new york for all but 8 of his 59 years says he is a registered democrat who voted twice for mr giuliani but now wants to see him go when i heard he wanted to stay i thought about it for a while he said but you know what his time 's up it 's the rule of the people and term limits should stand there are other people who are capable of running the city of new york few neighborhoods benefited more from the quality of life improvements during the eight years of the giuliani administration than those in the 66th assembly district home to dozens of art galleries trendy restaurants popular parks and quaint shops the area thrived during the giuliani years when shoppers and tourists felt it was safe to be out at night marianne salerno a 60 year old medical assistant who has lived in the west village for 50 years remembers the time when sitting on a bench in washington square park was considered risky now children play in the park 's playground while their parents read magazines glancing up only occasionally to check on them and it is all because of giuliani said ms salerno i do n't say so because i 'm italian that has nothing to do with it it 's because he is a great mayor the day of the primary ms salerno a republican who often votes for democrats wrote mr giuliani 's name on the ballot even though she favored mr green but now she will vote for mr green ms salerno says she is opposed to mr ferrer because he has the support of the rev al sharpton whom she dislikes she also disapproves of mr ferrer 's refusal to allow mr giuliani a chance to stay on as mayor for three more months how can ferrer not give giuliani three months she said he deserves at least three more months if i were in charge i would change the constitution and have him stay forever ruth a peltason 45 a book editor who lives on barrow street in the village said that she too could not understand why mr ferrer turned down mr giuliani 's request and she said she was shocked when mr ferrer attempted to use his experiences in rebuilding the bronx to try to persuade voters that he was the best candidate to rebuild lower manhattan when i heard him say that i thought 'buddy you are wrong she said this is so big you ca n't possibly compare the two she decided to vote for mr green in the runoff then when former mayor edward i koch endorsed mr ferrer on tuesday ms peltason thought again about her choices koch 's decision did give me pause she said i was very pro koch but you know what this is bigger than koch too in the end though it was mr green 's agreeing to share power with mr giuliani for a few months that convinced her she had picked the right candidate oprah winfrey called him the mayor of the united states she said speaking of mr giuliani for ferrer to say in essence 'i do n't need the guy was not politically smart you never kick out a favorite that 's precisely what cemented paul monahan 's favorable opinion of mr ferrer mr monahan a 41 year old independent contractor who has lived in the west village for 12 years said he voted for mr ferrer in the primary for no specific reason it was more of a gut feeling he said i do n't like mark green he said there is just something about him i do n't know what it is because i know he is a dedicated public servant mr monahan became convinced that he had made the right choice after mr ferrer turned mr giuliani down i think at first i did n't like ferrer 's saying no to giuliani he said it seemed so cold and blunt but he was the only one who saw through the whole thing and had it right from the beginning see the terrorists win the more we change he explained so we should n't change we are bigger than that we are supposed to get a new mayor so let 's go elect a new mayor

 it is 12 30 pm and i am riding the stationary bicycle at the livingwell health club a moderately priced gym a stone 's throw from parliament in london 's smaller dinkier approximation of capitol hill this is prime time for exercise when urbanites everywhere spend their lunch hours crunching and toning to look as lean and hungry as urbanites everywhere are supposed to look but not at this gym on the treadmill next to me is a man in an old gray t shirt with his stomach hanging down over his too tight shorts and a face so red and sweaty that he looks like he might well not survive into the evening over at the free weights is a woman wobbly in a retro style leotard whose concept of reps is to heave one of the weights over her head let gravity pull it back to the ground and then rest for a while in the pool which is not divided into lanes because people do n't generally swim laps in it are several women of various shapes and sizes who do the breast stroke for a few minutes then they sit in the whirlpool then they go home when i joined the gym two years ago it was with a heavy heart i am all too familiar with new york health clubs the ones with the people elbowing you in aerobics class the peak hour time limits on the rowing machines all those scary fat free exercisers with their sports drinks and their weight belts and their puffing and pulse counting one of the gyms i went to had a sign up next to the pool to remind you not to viciously kick your fellow swimmers swimming laps is not a competitive sport it said but when i arrived at livingwell for my first session i was in for a shock although i had n't exercised in months and could only manage about 15 sit ups at a stretch that seemed to be at the high end of the spectrum among this particular crowd some of the members were presumably there for the purpose of getting into shape but the general definition of in shape seemed a loose and impressionistic one this is a gym i soon found where when you go to the buns and abs exercise class people actually compete to stand in the back of the room as far away from the mirrors as possible the reverse of the classic new york scenario where people secretly hope you will injure yourself so they can take your spot up front it is a gym where even at the busiest times there is always at least one empty stairmaster sometimes all of them are empty it is a gym where many of the members look as if they have never actually set foot inside a gym even when they are in fact inside there are gyms with less lackadaisical clientele in london i know gyms where young buff investment bankers in bicycle shorts sweat and strut as if they worked on wall street and were members of the new york health and racquet club but they are much fewer and farther between with a higher proportion of body conscious foreigners real britons it seems go to gyms like mine to the extent that they go at all if asked most britons would freely confess that they do n't care much about their buns or their abs they do n't enjoy admiring their aerobicized selves in full length mirrors there are no full length mirrors in the remarkably comfort free livingwell changing room anyway and in general they do n't want to give up the sort of habits that would upset the american surgeon general m ore than a quarter of them smoke if they eat a vegetable with their meat which is not always the case they are likely to smother it in butter and if they eat fish they are likely to eat it deep fried in batter with a generous helping of french fries on the side just as it is no surprise that many americans are clinically obese it is no surprise that by many standards britons are stunningly unhealthy and proud of it although they have a universal health care system and relatively high average life spans they also have a yen for scotch eggs deep fried hard boiled eggs wrapped in sausage and rolled in bread crumbs although they like to go for long walks in the rain they also spend an average of 25 hours a week watching television americans watch about 26 hours a week they enjoy baked beans on their baked potatoes and drink an average of 11 alcoholic drinks a week and while one in four will get cancer at some point in their lives they seem to spend a curiously small amount of time worrying about it only 11 percent of the population has private health insurance and the rest take potluck with the national health service a system that can be wonderful and can be atrocious and which does not provide regular physicals teeth do n't even think about it fluoride is an thorny political issue here many people regard it as an unwarranted governmental intrusion into private life and as a result only 10 percent of the population lives in an area where the drinking water is fluoridated by way of illustrating how the country 's dental health is improving the british dental association recently announced that only 13 percent of british adults have no teeth at all down from 28 percent in 1979 of those with one or more teeth though only 50 percent visit their dentists regularly on a recent trip back to new york i went with a friend to the reebok sports club on the upper west side a health club so bustling and so full of hard core exercisers that it makes the weight room at livingwell look like the physical therapy department in an orthopedic hospital while livingwell has a breakfast buffet that involves a couple of vats of generic cereal reebok has a full service cafe that sells health shakes made on the spot with fresh fruit while the shower room at livingwell consists of three showers that smell of mildew the shower room at reebok is a vast complex where each shower is connected to its own changing room complete with its own set of shampoos creams and the like there were no free treadmills but as i waited already agitated as i willed the man ahead of me to get off the machine i remembered the new york gym one friend belonged to some years ago in the heart of wall street and filled with junior bankers with little time to spare between deals if your equipment of choice was occupied you had to sign up at the front desk and wait for your turn to be announced over the loudspeaker there was something wonderfully apt about a disembodied voice intoning brent to the treadmill brent to the treadmill as each fledgling executive took his place in britain brent probably would n't wait for the treadmill he 'd go to the pub instead

 the former manager of mayor rudolph w giuliani 's disbanded senate campaign said yesterday that the campaign would transfer hundreds of thousands of dollars to state campaign committees for new york republican candidates next week the manager bruce j teitelbaum added that the campaign had already given 6000 directly to representative bob franks the republican senate candidate in new jersey and 10000 to joan b johnson the republican candidate for rick a lazio 's seat on long island the campaigns for mr franks and ms johnson confirmed the contributions last night but mr giuliani still has about 35 million in the bank from his abandoned race against hillary rodham clinton although a number of state republicans have said that the mayor should give the bulk of that money to state and national republican candidates as he is allowed to do by law a republican close to mr giuliani said yesterday that mr giuliani had no intention of doing that giving all his money away is absurd the republican said it would be folly money is power in politics by preserving some of his cash he preserves his options there is some speculation that mr giuliani might run for governor in 2002 the mayor has also expressed an interest in running for mayor again in 2005 mr teitelbaum said that mr giuliani 's campaign had given money directly to some republican incumbents who are considered vulnerable mr teitelbaum said the mayor had given 7500 to state senator guy j velella of the bronx 5000 to state senator frank padavan of queens and 5000 to state senator thomas p morahan of rockland county he has also given 1750 each to 10 assembly candidates although the total contributions are not as large as many state republicans would like they are nonetheless an attempt to spread political good will and influence on behalf of the mayor mr giuliani withdrew from the race in may citing his prostate cancer there remains some anger in the party over his protracted decision and the turbulence in his personal life at the time on may 10 mr giuliani announced that he was seeking a separation from his wife donna hanover then two days later took a public stroll with another woman judith nathan

 costa gavras 's latest movie amen which opens in the united states in late january once again singles him out as a rare filmmaker who is unafraid of tackling political subjects in this case he has adapted rolf hochhuth 's 1963 play the deputy in which pope pius xii is portrayed as refusing to act on information about the holocaust both the play and the movie are based on the true story of a dissident ss officer who revealed de tails of the nazi gas chambers to the vatican what particularly links this english language movie to the greek born mr costa gavras 's other works is its combination of political thriller and moral debate he frequently focuses on the moral choices faced by civilized people during moments of political repression even more pertinently he poses the question how would we act in the same circumstances his aim may be to denounce dictatorships of left and right but he recognizes that individuals are often as cowardly as they are heroic invariably based on true stories his films also mirror the darker chapters of western history since 1939 z the 1968 movie that made his name as a political director was an undisguised protest against the right wing colonels ruling greece at the time two years later the confession dwelled on stalinist oppression in czechoslovakia in 1973 state of siege looked at both left wing terrorism and cia meddling in uruguay in 1982 missing told of the disappearance of a young american after chile 's rightist coup in 1973 brought gen augusto pinochet to power then with the end of the cold war an earlier past resurfaced in music box in 1989 mr costa gavras explored whether a retired hungarian living in chicago once headed an ss death squad now in amen he addresses the most crucial question of all could anything have been done to avert or stop the holocaust in practice he suggests political interest overshadowed the moral imperative alan riding

had developed the road map for medical research after consulting more than 300 experts from universities industry government and consumer groups while the nih conducts some research at its headquarters in bethesda md most of its money is given away in grants to 212000 researchers at 2800 universities medical schools and other institutions dr zerhouni laid out a master plan so that rather than passively accepting the priorities of these scientists the agency will now emphasize specific fields of study and new technology that might produce major breakthroughs under the plan the institutes could be more involved in the earliest stages of drug development before drugs are tested in people in addition dr zerhouni said the institutes will provide training in clinical research to community doctors who can help test treatments and disseminate the findings of biomedical research mary woolley president of research america a nonprofit group that wants to make health research a higher priority said this is long overdue it means that more people will be enrolled in clinical trials one goal of the institutes plan is to catalog the intricate networks that transmit information among genes molecules and cells scientists believe that disturbances in these biological pathways can cause disease more precise knowledge of the molecular events that lead to health or disease can revolutionize the practice of medicine dr zerhouni said another goal is to create a picture gallery showing the three dimensional structure of all the proteins in the body misshapen proteins are the culprits behind many diseases including cystic fibrosis and alzheimer 's dr zerhouni said he wanted to get away from the notion that every research project has one principal investigator the future he said will require much more team science conducted by interdisciplinary groups of molecular biologists chemists physicists mathematicians behavioral scientists pharmacologists and epidemiologists in addition dr zerhouni said he wanted to speed the development of new drugs by creating a public collection of hundreds of thousands of chemical compounds that could be tested by scientists with advanced technology now available only to pharmaceutical companies data from testing such compounds would go into a freely accessible public database dr zerhouni said dr david korn senior vice president of the association of american medical colleges welcomed this commitment saying it would establish public repositories of critically important research tools dr zerhouni said his plan would not require additional money but would rely on contributions made by units of the institutes from their existing budgets 130 million in 2004 and 21 billion over five years the road map emphasizes research to translate discoveries from the laboratory to the clinic and then into the everyday practice of medicine two of dr zerhouni 's initiatives are potentially controversial he said he wanted to foster more partnerships between the public and private sectors but some members of congress have expressed concern about such arrangements saying that the institutes had allowed drug companies to reap large profits from drugs like taxol developed with public money senator ron wyden democrat of oregon said that when the government invested in drug development it must get an adequate return in royalties and must ensure that the drug is affordable to patients dr zerhouni also said he wanted to streamline federal requirements pertaining to clinical research to reduce the burden on researchers but members of congress say the government has not adequately supervised or regulated some types of research like gene therapy alan i leshner chief executive of the american association for the advancement of science and carl b feldbaum president of the biotechnology industry organization a trade group praised the initiatives saying they would benefit patients and researchers
 ask a south korean on the streets of this city what he or she thinks about president bush 's recent statements including north korea in a so called axis of evil and many will say they are shocked and even insulted probe a little further and despite the widespread feeling of offense many people here also say they agree with mr bush up to a point with the approach of mr bush 's first official visit to this country on tuesday few south koreans took direct issue with his characterization of north korea instead in numerous interviews people from all walks of life expressed chagrin that mr bush had shown so little delicacy in addressing a government that their own government has struggled to engage and they said they were worried that mr bush had made things worse this is the world of south korean public opinion in which few countries arouse such conflicted feelings as the united states and north korea put the two together and add some provocative language from an american president and feelings that seem mutually contradictory begin to surface the sunshine policy is generally accepted as the greatest achievement of the kim dae jung government said song kyung sang referring to mr kim 's diplomacy of engagement with the north but with that single remark bush seems like he is trying to destroy it mr song a 58 year old novelist added the fact that he would say such things without consulting koreans first is frankly an embarrassment to us another man of the same generation who was out enjoying the last day of the lunar new year holiday with his family expressed the same kind of shock but with a nuance basically i agree with what bush said said the man a corporate executive named lee bong hwan the way he said it though just was n't professional maybe this is the way people talk in america but in korea and in this part of the world it sounds a bit strange washington has a history here of building up resentments with what south koreans see as scant consultation followed by rash actions and statements in 1977 president jimmy carter announced during a visit that the united states should withdraw its 37000 troops from this country similarly koreans say they were surprised to learn after the fact that president bill clinton had come close to war with north korea in 1994 over the issue of nuclear weapons production we have talked about this quite a bit among ourselves and most of my friends think that bush 's comments were way too strong said june lee a 28 year old employee of an internet company personally i kind of agree with president bush we are giving aid to north korea all the time and getting nothing in return the comments were too strong and the timing was bad but in a way he is right ms lee 's comments touch upon a major fault line in opinion between washington and seoul if mr bush thinks the government of kim jong il is evil because of its international missile sales many south koreans think the north evil mostly for its human rights abuses and for something more insidious the drag of a desperately poor north korea on this country 's astounding recent economic progress remarkably although seoul is just 30 miles from the world 's most heavily armed border and though north and south korea remain technically at war few south koreans perceive their neighbor as quite such a threat as washington says it is instead many south koreans dread the effects that helping north korea might have on their prosperity yet although a growing sense of being had by north korea has steadily eroded the president 's popularity most koreans say the sunshine policy should continue after the presidential election in december we do n't really know the inner workings of the sunshine policy said kim sang bum 34 a computer company employee interviewed in a downtown park but over all even though we complain about it everyone knows that it is a good thing

 with a play reading actors read the words aloud the audience reacts one playwright will stand onstage cloaked by the curtain watching intently as the audience laughs was there a laugh there he asks himself nervously checking the script another may walk over to the chinese restaurant across the street for him the reaction any reaction is just too much to bear he 'll wait for the exit poll playwrights are sweating out the birth of their plays at the bendheim performing arts center in scarsdale monday nights through the spring painful as a first reading may be it does n't compare with the possibilities for the program following michael taub a professor of judaic studies at purchase college mediates a discussion with the playwright the director the cast and for all frustrated armchair critics the audience for some playwrights the audience interaction is a gift 'that 's really the exciting part of it said bruce bloom of southold on long island a marketing consultant and longtime member of the greenville community theater mr bloom 's best meal you ever ate is next on the block dec 4 to have an interactive thing with the audience is something you do n't get every often mr bloom said mostly the lights come up and they get up and leave you want to be able to see the audience response to certain lines turns of the plot does it all work of course they may say your baby 's ugly what are you going to do if they make a valid point then i have a basis for going back and making it better and if it 's absolutely a bomb then i throw it away and start another one for the playwright the anxiety the pain and the applause are all part of a play 's birthing process said leslie wiesen the artistic director of the bendheim and assistant director of the jewish community center of mid westchester of which the bendheim is a part this is a tightrope to walk she said you 're raw you are out there some people are better at it than others the playwright for the oct 16 reading of the last jew of boyle heights steve greenstein avoided the tightrope altogether he stopped audience members if he sensed they were going to criticize the play for me it was to hear my own work said mr greenstein a bronx native who divides his time between new jersey and los angeles to get up there and hear feedback from the audience i 'm too vulnerable a lot of people say way off base things and it 's an unfair place to put the writer the audience has to understand that they are in a very ground level place a growth place but people love to play the critic mr greenstein had other issues to cope with his director quit forcing him to direct the night before the reading appendicitis struck an actor that forced mr greenstein to act too both jobs made it challenging for him to play the playwright although he called the opportunity a positive experience ms wiesen and the bendheim 's managing director barbara lavery choose the plays this year 10 were submitted the bendheim 's staff is small so it has relied primarily upon word of mouth to advertise the selection process to avoid being overwhelmed for obvious reasons the bendheim tends to get plays with jewish themes the best meal you ever ate tells the story of jean paul a celebrated chef who makes his way through the rubble of the jewish ghetto to create an exquisite meal for avrim and netti the last remaining jews fighting the nazis the setting for the last jew of boyle heights is an area in los angeles that was once the largest jewish community west of the mississippi the disputation occurs in spain during the middle ages when christians and jews publicly debated ideas it is a screenplay adaptation by andrzej krakowski and andrzej wohl from a play by hyam maccoby and will be read april 2 just one play james b nicola 's donuts and discussion to be read feb 12 addresses issues beyond jewish culture a 16 year old boy who is committed to a mental institution for shooting his classmate meets with his lawyer perhaps most important in the choice of a play ms wiesen said is the presence of a strong voice we want a play that says something interesting to the community that is of social value or the best laugh you ever had she said do we think this is something that needs a lot of work and would benefit from a sophisticated audience this is the second season for the monday play readings the goal is to gain exposure for the playwrights work and to increase awareness of the field of american jewish drama a field open to good work whether or not it has a social message mr taub said it 's an ongoing debate should a play that says a lot but is weak get preference over a good play with less weighty subject matter mr taub said a good quality play is definitely the one that should be chosen over one that is bad but has a great deal of substance people want audiences who want satisfaction me i like the good plays bendheim performing arts center jcc of mid westchester 999 wilmot road scarsdale the

 new york will become the first state to require that nearly all nonviolent criminals who are drug addicts be offered treatment instead of jail time in an effort to sharply reduce both the number of repeat offenders clogging the courts and the population in the state 's prisons and jails many states including new york have offered pilot programs like this in certain courts but not on this scale and never statewide chief judge judith s kaye who has wide latitude to restructure the courts yesterday ordered them to start phasing in the program immediately it will be fully in place by 2003 judge kaye said the initiative would divert up to 10000 nonviolent criminals a year to addiction treatment a significant number in a state where 95000 people are behind bars it will not however apply to nonviolent offenders convicted under the state 's rockefeller era drug laws which sometimes result in longer sentences for people arrested with drugs than for rapists and murderers criminal justice experts and court officials noting that court required treatment has an average success rate of 70 percent said the initiative would reduce the number of people who repeatedly commit crimes like burglary and prostitution to support their addictions they predicted that the state 's inmate population would decrease by at least 10 percent once the program was in full force some experts said judge kaye 's order was a sign that the courts were evolving into a social service agency of last resort focusing on rehabilitation as well as on punishment the chief judge said the plan would deal not only with a criminal justice problem but also with ruined lives broken families neglected children ravaged communities judge kaye estimated that the initiative would save the government 500 million a year in prison foster care and mental health costs without requiring more beds in treatment programs to be eligible offenders will have to test positive for drugs and be willing to plead guilty they will be assigned to specially trained judges who will monitor their cases instead of going to jail the defendants will enter a rigorous treatment program that will generally last two years and they will submit to strict monitoring by court officials including continued drug tests if they relapse they will go to jail most likely receiving stiffer sentences than normally given now although that will be left to the judge 's discretion even when defendants choose to stand trial the judges and district attorneys will still have the discretion to refer them to drug treatment until trial if they are found not guilty in all likelihood treatment will be continued said a court spokesman david bookstaver the commission that researched the plan for judge kaye included drug treatment experts district attorneys judges and lawyers who were asked to study how the burdens on the court system could be eased without compromising public safety the chairman of the commission robert b fiske jr a former united states attorney in manhattan said at a news conference yesterday that the initiative was not soft on crime noting that it would not apply to violent criminals or those punished under the rockefeller laws the commission however urged the state legislature to give judges more flexibility under those drug sentencing laws criminal justice experts praised the initiative saying that it recognized the futility of punishing drug addicts only to have them commit more crimes later but some experts said it did not go far enough and might tempt some people who wanted treatment to plead guilty even if they had not committed a crime in an ideal society we would not create compulsion or overly strong incentives to plead guilty said charles d adler chairman of the criminal law committee of the new york city bar association there are other questions about how the program will be carried out it requires a vast apparatus within the courts to screen and track addicts and those difficulties the commission 's report notes are magnified in new york city where the number of drug addicts accused of crimes dwarfs the caseload in upstate cities over the last two decades drug related cases in new york state have increased by 400 percent the report said in new york city alone 75 percent of all people arrested tested positive for drugs and the rate of repeat offenses among nonviolent offenders who are addicts can be as high as 35 percent the commission said typically these defendants are arraigned and then sentenced by judges with no expertise in drug problems who may see more than 100 cases a day spending an average of 5 minutes on each according to court records the quickest way for judges to dispose of these cases is to sentence the defendants to jail leading to spiraling costs the state spends nearly 650 million a year to imprison drug offenders or 29000 a person at the same time the more than 1200 drug treatment centers in the state have available space substance abuse experts said and can expand as the courts provide more clients most of the treatment under this plan will be paid for by medicaid or public assistance programs and the plan 's cost about 1036 million a year will be more than offset by the savings state officials said it 's an approach that 's steeped in rationality and common sense said timothy murray who developed the nation 's first drug treatment court in miami in 1990 and is the director of program development for the bureau of justice assistance at the united states department of justice it 's astonishing to see the results when people go through court mandated treatment on average court mandated drug treatment programs around the country succeed for 70 percent of those enrolled in new york city 's pilot programs only 12 percent of the offenders who participated were arrested again compared with 35 percent of those who did not go through a program marilyn sanders 37 said the pilot drug court in brooklyn on which this system will be modeled transformed her life ms sanders who is from a middle class family said that she fell into drug abuse and poverty and that the courts took away her two children after finishing the court treatment program she became an aide for the office of court administration in brooklyn the life i am living now is so great and wonderful she said they gave me a chance to turn my life around but she said if you get this opportunity you 've got to be willing

 despite negotiations that continued into the early morning hours nassau county officials failed to reach a final agreement today on 50 million in recurring spending cuts and new revenues needed to help balance this year 's budget nassau county 's leaders had hoped to have a deal by the time they met here this afternoon with frank g zarb who is gov george e pataki 's special adviser on the county 's fiscal crisis but officials said that while they had reached a tentative agreement on 50 million in cuts and revenues some of them will not recur mr zarb asked the parties to keep working and scheduled another meeting for monday county leaders said they remained optimistic the meeting today has clearly indicated that a tremendous amount of progress has been made said thomas s gulotta a republican who is the county executive we have more work to do we have committed to continue work throughout the weekend and it is our objective to have the final resolution in place sometime monday and the usually warring factions of the county 's divided government mr gulotta judith a jacobs a democrat and the presiding officer of the county legislature and john ciotti the deputy minority leader on the legislature made a rare move by appearing together afterward and praising one another the hitch in the proceedings stems from two problems one is that the parties are still arguing over several cost cutting proposals including a democratic plan to lay off nonunion county workers and a republican counter plan to offer early retirement incentives the other problem is that many of the 502 million in savings and revenues agreed on so far are one shot deals that will not recur the county can use nonrecurring measures to plug its hole this year officials said but it must balance them with recurring savings and revenues next year all told ms jacobs said county officials have agreed on roughly 43 million in recurring items for 2001 the county faces a tough road ahead once its leaders agree on the 50 million in cuts and revenues for this year they must find 70 million more in recurring cuts and revenues for each of the next three years officials warn that the cuts could be painful and a june 30 deadline is looming standard poor 's the credit rating agency has threatened that if the county does not show significant improvement by then it will downgrade the county 's bond rating to junk status county officials said they were confident that they could agree on cuts by monday ms jacobs said she got a good omen while taking a break from the budget talks on wednesday for some chicken lo mein her fortune cookie read negotiations move along smoothly the outcome is favorable

 students from across the state now have some new insight into what life was like in connecticut from 1800 to 1950 a new web site called connecticut history online wwwcthis toryonlineorg offers 12500 photographs prints and drawings that illustrate the business social educational political and cultural life of the time among the images are those of a tobacco farm in east windsor a textile mill in willimantic fishing trawlers in stonington and trains in bridgeport there are photos of businesses natural disasters such as the hurricane of 1938 and a collection of 19th century drawings of towns across the state the site though is mostly about people there is a large collection of everyday people at work and play each photo is accompanied by an extensive description the site also features lesson plans and ideas for teachers about how to integrate the images into their curriculum there is also a section called journeys which offers themes such as women at work and connecticut goes to the beach selected groups of images introduce each theme and there are instructions how to find additional information on the subject the project is a collaboration between the connecticut historical society mystic seaport and the thomas j dodd research center at the university of connecticut the web site was officially started thursday we 're very very proud of this said the project director nancy finlay of the connecticut historical society not many people know about it yet i ca n't wait to see what they say when they realize it 's out there she said the web site makes the collections of the three institutions more accessible than ever in the past she said people wanting to look at photographs in the historical society 's collection would have to make an appointment go to it hartford to search its archives and then order copies of the items they wanted the process could take several weeks and often required a great deal of staff time this did n't help the kid who had a social studies project due ms finlay said now you can do it yourself and it 's instantaneous this is light years from what we could do just a year ago i ca n't believe the way it has transformed the way people can do research about 50 people from the three institutions worked to create the site using a 335000 grant from institute of museum and library services barbara sheppard the institute 's deputy director said her organization awarded the grant in 1999 because the project showed a collaboration between museum and libraries and resulted in one database that improved the accessibility of the images she said the institute saw it as a model for other states and organizations while there is a similar project in colorado and one in montana devoted to indian tribes the connecticut project is the only one of its kind in the northeast this is a real public service she said there 's a wealth of information here the seaport provided 5000 images the historical society 4000 and the dodd research center 3500 they are just a fraction of the 22 million images the three organizations have in their combined collections the quality and variety of connecticut images owned by these three institutions is astonishing said mary ann stets curator of photography at mystic seaport ms stets said the seaport which has the world 's largest collection of maritime photography not only contributed photos of boats shipbuilding and fishing but also a large number of portraits some of which feature unidentified subjects she said even those images are valuable because they offer insight into the lifestyle and dress of people from the 19th century it also provided an extensive collection of photographs of the stonington fishing fleet the state 's last surviving fleet she said the site will not only provide primary sources and show teachers how to use them but will offer a reminder that the three institutions have even greater resources to help them with their research needs most of the state 's 169 towns are represented with the hartford and southeastern connecticut areas having the most images ms finlay said the fairfield county area has the fewest and the three organizations would welcome images from groups in that area one of the more popular aspects of the site is the locator it enables the user to zoom in on a specific town or even a street to search for those images during the last 18 months there has been a pilot project online as the three organizations added images and made refinements to the site during that time teachers have also developed lesson plans and methods for using the images in the classroom one of those teachers is patricia wiedenmann who teaches fifth  and sixth grade gifted and talented students at the bear path school in hamden it 's an amazing amazing site she said it broadens the background that teachers can bring to the classroom it 's a wonderful resource for us as teachers ms wiedenmann said the images such as those that show how children dressed and played in the 1800 's create a much more lasting form of knowledge for students it 's so much more vivid than just reading about it and having it local captivates them even more she said using a computer to view the images makes it even more attractive to students she added ms wiedenmann said she used the site for a unit on immigration we hope to get other teachers interested in it she said once they start looking at it they will be able to make their own lessons from it while the project was originally designed for middle and high school students the appeal has gone far beyond that target audience we 're seeing it used by all sorts of people now ordinary people not just students ms finlay said i got a call from a man who said 'i punched in burlington and i found a picture of my grandfather 's farm we did n't appreciate how broad the appeal of this would be the three institutions are preparing another grant application for the next phase of the project

 the sept 11 hijackings have left pilots wanting more knowledge about activity in the passenger cabin without stepping through their newly fortified doors now the transportation department with encouragement from congress is considering requiring video cameras that will provide images of passengers to the cockpit manufacturers working to anticipate a demand are developing systems including one that would transmit images from hidden cameras to the cockpit and to tiny hand held screens that air marshals could look at without blowing their cover united airlines will begin a six month test of cabin surveillance this summer using a system built by rockwell collins which has its headquarters here the system feeds the images from as many as 32 cameras to hand held computers in the cockpit and beams them back into the cabin where they can be picked up by a pocket computer robert g geers of rockwell collins demonstrated the system on an hp jornada which captured the images from tiny cameras hidden in a model of a first class cabin it also captured pictures from a camera focused on people in a hotel conference room here who jerked a bit like a charlie chaplin character because the system does not run as fast as an ordinary television but the image was clear mr geers tapped the screen with a stylus to alternate among images to the guy next to the marshal it just looks like he 's playing a video game said mr geers a business development manager united plans a four camera system on a boeing 747 that pilots can use to assure themselves before they emerge from the cockpit to use the lavatory that no one is lurking behind the door in wait since sept 11 airlines have relied on secret knocks and passwords jet blue a new airline based in new york that flies a new airbus a320 fleet recently put cameras on several of its 25 planes and expects to install them on all planes in a few months two cameras are visible one outside the cockpit door and the other at the rear galley and two others are hidden said fiona morrison a spokeswoman it gives our pilots some eyes she said security officials are intrigued at a hearing of the senate commerce committee on may 21 the undersecretary of transportation for security john magaw said no to giving pilots guns but expressed strong interest in giving them video surveillance of the cabin if pilots knew a hijacking attempt was under way they could throw their planes into radical maneuvers mr magaw said to knock the hijackers over unless you are seat belted in they can make your equilibrium so that you ca n't function he said senator barbara boxer democrat of california said it 's not expensive it 's not a new tech a high tech situation it 's a rearview mirror please do it do n't wait united likes the idea of surveillance but not radical maneuvers i do n't mind the rearview mirror part said capt joseph d burns united 's director for flight operations technology in a telephone interview but he said airplanes are tested up to certain limits in maneuvering exceed that and you 're a test pilot he said your chance of damaging the aircraft beyond repair exceeds your chance of disabling a hijacker the rockwell collins camera system can be configured to record and to play back the last few seconds and can be set up to beam images to the ground rockwell collins 's main american rival in the commercial avionics business honeywell has been offering camera systems to airlines since early this year said ben mcleod the company 's director of aviation safety and security mr mcleod said in a telephone interview that he thought flight crew unions would push the airlines into installing the systems even if the government never required them ultimately that 's where the motivation will come from he said the systems could sell for a second reason he said the occurrence of hijackings is going to be so rare he said but air rage is far more frequent before sept 11 air rage was a major concern for airlines what we 've seen historically is the only cases successfully prosecuted were those where they had had some hard evidence mr mcleod said a tape would provide that he added mr mcleod said honeywell 's system would have at least three cameras mostly to assure people on the flight deck that it was safe to come out to use the restroom but there could be 10 on a large plane he said mr geers of rockwell foresaw cameras in cargo holds to look for stowaways or other problems and cameras under the belly so pilots at the gate could tell whether the cargo doors had been latched the honeywell system 's cameras could be black and white or color but the system will also use infrared mr mcleod said that makes it possible for the system to see in the dark at jet blue executives decided that recording the images would violate passengers privacy but a placard on the cockpit door tells passengers that they may be under video surveillance that alone may reduce air rage ms morrison said
 i have only a nodding acquaintance with robert a patient who sees a colleague down the hall still he waves when we pass and i register once again that he looks terrible worse than last month and far worse than last year despite that cheerful grin the skin on robert 's face is stretched tight against the bones silhouetting the movement of every muscle his smile is a death mask his arms and legs have become skinny and his torso bulky bloated into a belt encircled humpty dumpty oval when i tell you that robert is infected with hiv the virus that causes aids you would be perfectly justified in concluding that he is slowly dying you would be wrong robert is doing spectacularly well by the numbers in his chart he is an unqualified treatment success no traces of the virus in his bloodstream normal numbers of immune active cells no more of the recurrent infections that plagued him years ago back when he really was dying of aids back then he looked great taut and muscular with a slight fever flush a real adonis now restored to health with a concoction of hiv drugs he looks mortally ill like all drugs the lifesaving aids drugs have their annoying side effects nausea diarrhea skin rashes and the like but for some people they also come with a set of truly ghoulish complications slowly remodeling the body turning people into weirdly living visions of the exact fate they are taking the drugs to elude the process is called lipodystrophy a breakdown in the normal ways the body processes and stores fat of all the mysteries of aids it is proving one of the most difficult to crack some people never get it in others the body fat reacts to medication right away causing not only cosmetic disasters like robert 's but also diabetes high cholesterol heart and vascular disease and fatty fragile bones none of the 15 aids drugs on the market seem entirely free of risk no treatment seems very effective confusing the picture is that as aids patients live longer they are beginning to fall victim to the ordinary consequences of aging like diabetes cholesterol problems and slowly expanding waistlines what comes from the medication what from passing years a study presented at an aids conference in chicago last month found that an alarming 63 percent of people taking antiretroviral drugs developed lipodystrophy but according to the definition of the syndrome researchers were using 33 percent of ordinary hiv negative controls got it too aids clinics have always been full of strange juxtapositions drag queens slumped next to pregnant women businessmen leaning away from nodding addicts never has the scene been stranger than it is now when the well often look quite sick and the sick quite well and no one can say for sure if the arrival of that small gut of middle age is something to celebrate or not aids activists used to agitate for faster fda approval of aids drugs now they demonstrate for faster drug distribution to africa and other impoverished countries but the complexities of these drugs just do not fit on a placard anymore in yet another strange juxtaposition nearly all the patients in the clinic especially the activists are beginning to lobby to get off their drugs for a while coasting on the accrued benefits in hopes of avoiding the worst of their toxicity robert must have made his peace by now with the single overriding law of pharmacotherapy that you never get something for nothing i looked at his chart last week he has tried testosterone and anabolic steroid hormones to regain his normal shape to no effect last year he had minor plastic surgery small plastic ovals implanted below the cheekbones to plump out his cheeks a little this year he had the implants taken out they just added more ridges to his sunken face robert is not at risk of dying of aids any time soon perhaps ever but if you were to meet him at a party or perhaps interview him for a job unless you are an unusually wise informed or nosy person you would come away filled with pity dismay and almost certainly an instinct to hire someone else as i waved at robert last week i was ushering juan into my office he is robert 's age robert 's height robert 's body type and as far as side effects he is one of the lucky ones a living advertisement for aids drugs once so sick he could barely walk juan is now a true adonis after four years on the same medications robert takes he has had no problems at all he looked at robert as they passed robert looked at him i looked at both of them we 're all waiting for the other shoe to drop

 this past week brought the official change from take our daughters to work day to take our children to work day i have lobbied for such a change in this space so i was proud to take evan my 12 year old and alison my writer to be niece to the office with me on thursday the day taught them a lot about how this newspaper works it taught them very little i 'm afraid about what i actually do here there are two reasons for this first i spent much of my time during their visit helping evan and ali and a variety of other children find their way around the building and most of what i do ca n't be learned by watching anyway in fact my kids have watched me for years and what they 've seen is this i sit in front of the computer talk on the phone travel places pull out my hair and pace for a while and then something with my name on it appears in print work is a concept children find hard to understand like sex the closer you get to doing it the more it starts to make sense but until then you have unrealistic views back when i was 5 or 6 i could not figure out what it meant that my father was an orthodontist why would anyone spend his day straightening teeth i wished he had a real job maybe as a normal dentist the kind my friends might actually use by the time i was 11 or 12 of course all my friends bared metal when they smiled and i moved on to wondering what my mother the psychologist did all day lisa earle mcleod 's two daughters do n't understand what their mother does for a living either the author of forget perfect ms mcleod is an inspirational humorist who gives funny speeches about finding joy meaning and satisfaction in the life you 've already got and the you you already are try explaining that to a child her material is about things like digging chips out of the sofa cushions and when her 10 year old tagged along once the girl 's conclusion was this mom i 'm funnier in the lunchroom than you are do you think it 's right to charge people for that some children understand enough about what their parents do to be dangerous alexandra allred 's father worked for the defense intelligence agency but did n't talk about it so when another child told her that both their fathers were spies alex began to brag about it problem was they were living in moscow at the time had he only explained things to me ms allred says now she would have known enough to shut up still explaining does n't always lead to understanding ms allred is a writer and for a book she was writing had to interview a stuntwoman by the name of lisa hoyle ms hoyle described picking up her daughter from kindergarten and being approached by classmates asking to see her stamps it seems that when ms hoyle said she was a stuntwoman her daughter heard it as stamp woman ms hoyle had to take her daughter to a movie shoot so she could see that what mommy did was jump off buildings even showing kids can leave room for confusion another part of ms allred 's research led her to join the united states women 's bobsled team i made sure my kids knew what i did and took them every chance i could to my training she said then came the day she was watching television with her eldest daughter and a bobsledding race came on is that you mommy little kerri asked pointing to the screen after all if mom is a bobsledder then all bobsledders must be mom one of the many parenting lessons i 've learned in short is that kids are inevitably confused by what their parents do a corollary is that once they figure out what we do they will question why we do it with all the interesting things to be in the world billionaire movie star major league pitcher how on earth did we end up in insurance or human resources or sales i recently received a note from jen singer creator of mommasaidcom a web site for stay at home mothers she worried that the popularity of take our children to work day would make it even harder for women whose children are their work she told the story of a friend whose 4 year old son asked what do you do when the friend answered i 'm a mommy the boy replied but i want you to do something odds are that if this mommy did something her 4 year old would suggest she do something else when evan was 4 he noticed that when he went to play at one favorite friend 's house that friend 's mother watched over them but when the boy came to our house our baby sitter was in charge some mommies are the kind who go to the office and other mommies are the kind who stay home i explained why he asked ca n't you be the other kind life 's work this column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week e mail belkin nytimescom correction may 11 2003 sunday the life 's work column on april 27 about take our children to work day misstated the address for a web site for stay at home mothers it is mommasaidnet not mommasaidcom

 the music industry may not like to put it in such stark terms but in 2001 it will bet on a business strategy that could undermine one of its sacred institutions the full length album this discrete packaging of 8 to 12 songs sold in record album form then eight track tape cassette and compact disc may have competition under the new business models being considered by the recording companies specifically the biggest recording companies are preparing to roll out subscription based services on the internet initially such services will enable users to listen to an entire catalog of music for a flat monthly fee eventually many in the industry envision that such services will allow users to download the music in their cars or portable players the record companies imagine that service as a bottomless on demand jukebox the idea is that when subscribers quit paying their access to the music will disappear and the music they have already downloaded will expire but no one knows for sure whether consumers will go for such a service the record companies argue that the explosive popularity of napster the free online file sharing service that remains under legal assault suggests they will because the labels say it demonstrates the allure of easily accessible music bertelsmann the german media giant cast its vote for a hybrid of the technology when it signed a deal with napster and embraced its creator sean fanning to turn napster into a for pay service but there is a second gamble in this plot this one belonging not to the record companies but to a number of technology companies they are vying to create a secure copyright management system that could be the backbone both of subscription services and for pay digital music business models like selling music for download on a per song basis record company executives say companies aspiring to create such technology which would encrypt music files and program them to expire are spilling out of the woodwork sensing a big opportunity but both record and technology companies are taking a big gamble they are betting that napster will either be shut down by the courts or unilaterally begin charging if neither happens and napster keeps growing all bets are off if napster stays free a lot of people will be doing a lot of rethinking an executive at one music technology company said matt richtel

 mayor rudolph w giuliani often begins his sentences with the phrase the reality is yesterday the reality he had to gingerly but firmly convey to embattled new yorkers was that the work being done on the spot where the world trade center once stood a place at once a burial ground crime scene tourist attraction and development site is no longer principally a recovery operation and has not been for some time in explaining that the mayor acknowledged the feelings of firefighters who know that scores of their colleagues remains are among the twisted steel and massive piles of debris at ground zero but he also made it clear that he felt it was no longer reasonable to have dozens of them picking through the debris at their own potential peril and that he would not tolerate violence in response to his decision i 've known from the beginning from the first night that it would be a burial ground the mayor said yesterday in perhaps the most blunt language he has used to describe the site since the attack the medical examiner the first night that i met with him on the evening of sept 11 told me that the crush of the buildings and the high degree of heat was going to mean that i think he said then the majority or vast majority of people would disappear because they would evaporate with that he put into words the painful image that the world has only silently mulled as the number of confirmed dead remains far below those believed to be missing that 's a horrible and terrible thing to have to confront he said during an afternoon news conference and you might remember my saying the first day or the first night that some things might be too difficult for people to comprehend or even accept initially but that 's the reality of what happened at the world trade center and we have to deal with it in a dignified way and in a professional way many firefighters were so disturbed by the city 's decision to remove most of them from the scene that a few hundred of them protested yesterday in a display that culminated in the arrests of 12 some were arrested for striking police officers the very people they have labored with side by side at the site yesterday 's spectacle and the response from city officials and the mayor in particular exposed the full spectrum of an entire city 's anguish there is the harsh truth that few remains will be discovered there is a mayor who has spent nearly every day at firefighters funerals or memorial services but who is now the object of their rage there is the anger and the guilt of all the living represented by a group of firefighters whose depth of emotions may not have been considered by the government officials left to break the news to them in the backdrop of all this anthrax attacks continue there is all told a giant municipal void where bodies information and succor are not if the mayor knew from day 1 that there was little likelihood of discovering bodies at ground zero he kept it to himself from the day the towers toppled into a vast pile of rubble he described the scene as a rescue operation and hewed to that description for nearly a month when it seemed clear that no life could be found there indeed emergency room employees stood eerily idle from the first hour on and the mayor has always made a point of emphasizing that discovering human remains was a top priority even as the bulldozers moved in when it became obvious that the recovery work would yield little he moved to give families urns of dust from the site a poignant but indirect statement of what would probably not happen and allowed people to get death certificates for loved ones all the while stressing that no one had to if they did not wish to but yesterday marked a clear shift when the living took precedence over the dead all of us standing here have friends that continue to remain there mr giuliani said and we would love to recover them but none of us standing here can possibly justify seeing a human being die in this effort if it is n't handled with great discipline and great responsibility as such just as doctors are advised never to treat their own family members the mayor seemed to think firefighters should not be involved in the clean up the reality is then said mr giuliani if you 're the police commissioner or the fire commissioner or the mayor and you 're responsible for the lives of other people you have to say well maybe these people are too emotionally involved to be involved in this operation maybe these are not the people that have the ability to detach so they can handle it professionally
 democratic congressmen who are visiting iraq this week stirred up anger among some republicans when they questioned the reasons president bush has used to justify possible military action against iraq one of the congressmen representative jim mcdermott of washington state said today that he thought president bush was willing to mislead the american people about whether the war was needed and that the administration had gone back and forth between citing supposed links between iraq and the terrorist network al qaeda and iraq 's supposed attempts to obtain weapons of mass destruction mr mcdermott and representative david e bonior of michigan also said it might still be possible to work out a new inspection approach that would satisfy the iraqis but fall short of what mr bush wants the two democrats strong comments about a foreign policy matter while traveling abroad drew rebukes from republicans at a time when the political furor over iraq and over a bill on domestic security has sharply divided leaders of the two parties they spoke on the abc news program this week and in other broadcast interviews senator don nickles republican of oklahoma who is the party 's assistant leader in the senate said mr mcdermott and mr bonior both sound somewhat like spokespersons for the iraqi government he said it was counterproductive to undermine mr bush when he was seeking support from allies senator john mccain republican of arizona was gentler as long as they 're careful what they say and what they do then i think it 's fine he said but all of us should keep in mind that foreign affairs national security issues etc are generally handled by the executive branch with the advice and consent of the congress speaking of the administration mr mcdermott said i believe that sometimes they give out misinformation then he added it would not surprise me if they came up with some information that is not provable and they 've shifted first they said it was al qaeda then they said it was weapons of mass destruction now they 're going back and saying it 's al qaeda again when pressed for evidence about whether president bush had lied mr mcdermott said i think the president would mislead the american people but he said he believed that inspections of iraq 's weapons programs could be worked out i think they will come up with a regime that will not require coercive inspections mr mcdermott said anticipating meetings on monday between hans blix the leader of the united nations inspection group and iraqi officials they said they would allow us to go look anywhere we wanted he said of the iraqis and until they do n't do that there is no need to do this coercive stuff where you bring in helicopters and armed people and storm buildings otherwise you 're just trying to provoke them into war he added mr bonior the second ranking democrat in the house said we 've got to move forward in a way that 's fair and impartial that means not having the united states or the iraqis dictate the rules to these inspections threats and responses politics correction october 2 2002 wednesday an article on monday about criticism of president bush by democratic congressmen who are visiting iraq this week referred incorrectly to one of them david e bonior while he represents michigan 's 10th district he is no longer the second ranking democrat in the house he gave up the leadership post in january to devote more time to running for governor nancy pelosi of california took over the no 2 job
 when israel and the palestinians are simultaneously engaged in a violent conflict and peace negotiations with the potential for their precarious relationship to disintegrate quickly israelis choice of a leader could have far reaching consequences yet 11 days before a possibly fateful election for israeli prime minister the campaign remains lackluster that is even despite a spate of negative campaign advertising this week that should have raised the temperature here but did not right wing voters angry about increased insecurity in israel and fearful about concessions to the palestinians are eager to kick out labor and usher in the likud party leader ariel sharon but they are relatively complacent that is largely because opinion polls show mr sharon far ahead of prime minister ehud barak those published today revealed a continued lead of 16 to 18 percentage points and it is also because mr sharon is a kind of accidental candidate the choice of the nationalist camp only because former prime minister benjamin netanyahu decided to sit out the race a 72 year old military and political veteran mr sharon is not particularly charismatic or telegenic and he is not trying to be what he is n't he is keeping a decidedly low profile his campaign appearances are limited and he is not holding big political rallies or even after being put on the defensive by students this week visiting any more schools on the other side the peace camp is acting depressed as if defeat were a foregone conclusion many centrists and leftists are demoralized by the last four months when the israeli palestinian peacemaking relationship devolved into a primal and blood soaked conflict many are specifically dispirited by mr barak for a variety of reasons some feel that mr barak did not respond forcefully enough to palestinian violence others that he responded too forcefully many think that he took his bedrock constituency for granted by among other things promising civic reforms and then making alliances with ultra orthodox parties only to return to his original promises after the religious parties undermined him and left his government they speak of his zigzags and of his perceived arrogance toward other politicians and toward the public one result is that more than a quarter of israeli voters are undecided or disinclined to vote according to a poll published today and many of these are former barak supporters that includes israeli arabs who are more antipathetic than apathetic in an impassioned column today in the newspaper haaretz yoel marcus urged israeli leftists to realize the importance of the election get over their personal disaffection with mr barak and stop fantasizing about a dream candidate what are you all waiting for he wrote the moment has now arrived for all of you to climb down from your fence to feel solid ground once more under your feet and to accept the fact that this is as good as it gets forget about waiting for another david ben gurion winston churchills and charles de gaulles are not strolling down any israeli street to paraphrase a popular israeli song 'the messiah is not coming and he 's not even going to phone the barak campaign is trying two tactics to lure the undecided and the disenchanted a kind of repentance campaign by mr barak who is apologizing for his errors and a scare campaign that seeks to portray mr sharon as a dangerous figure who could drag the nation into war polls today indicated that the latter message is sinking in and not making much of a difference more than 40 percent of israelis surveyed say they think that mr sharon is likely to hasten the risk of war but mr barak is still drawing only about a third of the voters as he was last week many israelis are steeled for a deterioration in the israeli arab conflict and mr sharon is considered an iron fist the peace talks in taba egypt which continued today and are expected to wrap up early next week possibly by sunday are not helping mr barak politically according to the polls one showed that if the talks resulted in an agreement which is highly unlikely mr sharon would win another 10 percent of the undecided voters on the evening news tonight a senior political commentator bored with reporting mr sharon 's commanding lead had already moved on to speculating about what mr barak would do after he lost the conclusion take a leave from politics and turn over the reins of the labor party to former prime minister shimon peres 77 it is also still not out of the question that mr barak would bow to mr peres before feb 6 and let mr peres run in his place mr barak has until four days before the election to do so under israeli law and speculation about the possibility has hurt him polls show that mr peres would run neck and neck with mr sharon this is the first election in israeli history for the premiership alone and that is one reason that the contest is not generating more noise the many israeli political parties in parliament are not in a battle for their seats but parliament as it stands is riven and it is possible that whoever wins will seek to forge a unity government to stabilize his leadership mr sharon has already expressed his interest in doing this and the prospect serves to weaken voter interest because of the possibility that the two candidates currently butting heads would end up joining forces mr netanyahu assessed that neither he nor anyone else would be able to assemble a stable working majority in this parliament he prefers he said to wait to run until parliament dissolved itself and the entire government moves toward yet another round of elections which he predicted would take place sooner rather than later this situation lowers many israelis expectations that whoever is elected will survive for long and therefore further undercuts their ability to take the current race ultra seriously in some sense people see this election as less important said yaron ezrahi a political scientist because no one thinks they are electing a prime minister who will serve out his term but given the situation of conflict even six months can make a huge difference for history
 when i tell people at parties that i am a nurse the question i often get is how on earth can you bear to empty bedpans i usually stop them short with this reply my patients are too sick to use bedpans i had never planned on nursing as a life long career but after a few years into it i realized i possessed a passion for working with very sick people and i took a job in the coronary intensive care unit at st vincent 's hospital in greenwich village i 've been there for 14 years now a typical day might start out quiet but it rarely stays that way suddenly a three star alarm reverberates in my well trained ear my eyes dart to the monitor and instead of normal heartbeats passing on the screen i see a wavy line indicating someone 's heart is about to stop panic comes close but then i tell myself i must remain calm even a moment of indecision can lead to severe harm or death to a patient as a team doctors and nurses we rush to the patient 's room and try to save him when the resuscitation effort is over there is n't much chance to bask in the knowledge that i assisted in saving a life or if the patient dies to grieve the loss and assist the family in their grief because my other patients need my attention once i entered a patient 's room after losing someone in a cardiac arrest and was greeted with where were you i asked you for a box of tissues an hour ago i wanted to say listen i just lost a patient but i realized he was scared and felt no control over the most basic functions of his existence my compassion overrode my irritation and i replied i 'm sorry you had to wait i 'll get your tissues right now my career has also led me on adventures outside the hospital one summer i worked as a volunteer in a clinic in north carolina that treated migrant workers from central america who were employed on the surrounding tobacco and potato farms they were hard workers and would n't take time out for illness or even to take medicine for their high blood pressure or diabetes in the evenings we would travel to the migrant camps and question the occupants about any symptoms they might have experienced this way we could catch a few people before they were too ill for help at the clinic a year later i traveled to tanzania in africa as a member of a medical team we saw up to 200 patients a day in old buildings left over from a mission as we drove up people lined the road and clapped they were so happy to have us there they kept repeating asanti sana which is swahili for thank you i saw many symptoms of malnutrition which included thyroid problems in young children and infants dehydrated because their mothers could n't produce milk to feed them two surgeons another nurse and i set up an operating room we hung our iv 's from the light fixtures and used the light of midafternoon along with two lamps to work by the high pain threshold of the people amazed me one man after we removed a hernia from his groin got off the table and walked to a truck full of people waiting for him surprisingly there were no postoperative infections many of the people we saw there complained of general aches and pains and we gave them aspirin and tylenol soon people were coming in asking for the pills we thought the news of our great drugs for treating pain had traveled but the interpreters informed us the people were using the pills as money to barter for goods and services we laughed at ourselves for thinking we could impose our culture on theirs
 calling a state financed radio advertisement that promoted the economy of upstate new york an obvious plug for representative rick a lazio her opponent in the senate race hillary rodham clinton contended today that mr lazio had violated an agreement to restrict spending on commercials it was the second time the two candidates squabbled over the interpretation of their pact to ban the use of soft money largely unrestricted unlimited contributions to political parties that buy air time for commercials today 's dispute came in the final weeks of the campaign and erupted over a murkier issue than the first one indicating that the candidates are intensely scrutinizing each other 's spending practices on the lookout for anything that could break the deal and perhaps allow more spending in the first incident mr lazio who has made banning the use of soft money a theme of his campaign agreed earlier this month to return about 14 million he had received from the republican national committee and spent on commercials but this time mr lazio called mrs clinton 's accusation laughable and his campaign immediately fired off a vitriolic response saying in a news release we thank mrs clinton for the chuckle the radio commercials at issue which were broadcast for four days this week on radio stations from westchester to albany and in binghamton featured a voice over by gov george e pataki a close republican ally of mr lazio 's the ads cost 14000 which was paid by the empire state development corporation a state agency the two candidates have disagreed sharply over how upstate new york 's economy is faring and the message in the commercial which touted ibm 's recent announcement that it would invest in a 25 billion chip manufacturing plant in dutchess county echoed mr lazio 's view that the region 's economy was rebounding in the commercial governor pataki said new york state 's economy is strong and our future has never looked brighter during a campaign stop on long island today mrs clinton cited an article published in the buffalo news that said the commercial was broadcast just before lazio commercials on several albany radio stations on friday the commercial she said was clearly intended to help mr lazio 's campaign i am appalled that the state would be doing this and spending state taxpayer dollars on it she said and i call on mr lazio to end it immediately she called the ads the second breach of our agreement and to use a baseball metaphor it 's a second strike although the pact apparently does not apply to ads by state agencies but mr lazio while on an eight stop campaign swing from manhattan to buffalo today said the commercial had no connection to his campaign and was a routine and effective tool to promote tourism economic development and job creation here in new york i am flabbergasted that she would reach so far he said speaking to reporters between campaign stops in binghamton the fact is these commercials have been running based on the 'i love new york theme i do n't know if mrs clinton has ever heard of that that slogan a spokesman for mr pataki called mrs clinton 's insistence that the commercial was aimed at helping mr lazio 's campaign a desperate desperate charge from someone who has no facts to back it up the spokesman michael mckeon said the timing of the commercial had no relationship to the election but was pegged to ibm 's announcement of its plans to build a plant in east fishkill the commercials began running tuesday a week after ibm 's announcement mr mckeon said the empire state development corporation regularly ran promotional ads when there was good news about the economy mrs clinton 's campaign manager bill de blasio sent a letter today to mr lazio 's campaign manager bill dal col asserting that if mr lazio wants to run feel good commercials justifying why he does n't have an economic plan for upstate he should do so with hard money and not rely on these state run issue ads the lazio campaign then issued a largely sarcastic news release likening mrs clinton 's accusation to saying that president clinton 's weekly radio addresses because they reflect viewpoints mrs clinton has also expressed during her campaign on topics like education and the middle east were also a breach of the soft money agreement the tongue in cheek news release continued the lazio campaign also revealed that an ad for oscar mayer bologna aired in the syracuse media market last week was aimed at subliminally boosting mrs clinton 's nonsensical economic plan the dispute spiced up a day of campaigning that while so close to the nov 7 election was otherwise sure to be overshadowed by the opening game of the world series mrs clinton who whispered me too to a young yankees fan at a bookstore in port washington was stumping through lazio turf he is from long island and on pretty solid met fans territory as mrs clinton was touring the dolphin bookstore on port washington boulevard robin ryan a co owner of the store offered the first lady a baseball cap that said port washington and suggested that she wear it mrs clinton smiled broadly but did not take the cap she did pick out two books barbara kingsolver 's prodigal summer and the pocket size blue day book a lesson in cheering yourself up mrs clinton suggested that she would give the little blue book to her mother she also signed several books for customers including little women which she said was one of her favorite books mr lazio a met fan posed for a picture at a baseball stadium in binghamton that is home to a mets minor league team his other stops today included a center for the elderly in binghamton where he promised to support prescription drug benefits for the elderly poor and spoke nostalgically about his grandmother rose who immigrated from italy when she was 11 he lately has taken to emphasizing his italian roots in a bid to appear more attractive to that sizable voting bloc at the binghamton center mr lazio encountered a dozen protesters who carried signs imploring him to pay more attention to the economy one demonstrator wore a pink ostrich costume and bent over repeatedly as if trying to stick his head in the ground a play on a clinton ad about the economy that mocks mr lazio by showing an ostrich sticking its head in the sand

 att will offer evidence that domestic telephone traffic diverted by mci through canada to avoid tariffs included calls that were placed by the state department and other government agencies a senior executive at att said today the executive said the evidence was to be formally disclosed to government investigators and a bankruptcy court in manhattan on monday the rerouting of domestic government calls through canada or other foreign countries would be problematic because the calls would not be protected from eavesdropping that could compromise national security law enforcement or confidential commercial information industry lawyers said if the rerouting is confirmed it could pose significant new problems for mci 's chapter 11 reorganization proceeding and its business with federal agencies the government is mci 's largest customer and authorities are close to completing a review of whether the company should be barred from winning new government contracts because of its admission that it committed the largest accounting fraud in history the att executive who spoke on condition that he not be identified said the company 's conclusions were based on tests it recently conducted after it received a request for information the request came from federal prosecutors attempting to determine whether mci over nearly a decade defrauded other phone companies by improperly redirecting or laundering telephone traffic to avoid access fee payments to other companies long distance telephone companies are required to make the payments which are among their highest transmission costs the fraud inquiry is based on evidence provided by former mci executives and on technical information supplied by att and two other mci rivals sbc communications and verizon all these sources have told investigators that a scheme to redirect telephone traffic avoided hundreds of millions of dollars and possibly more in fees that mci owed to local telephone companies they have also told investigators that thousands of recent test calls they made through mci lines show that two schemes to avoid the fees are continuing the three rivals of mci have competitive motives to try to derail its chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization which is heading into its final stage next month they have complained that mci 's recent settlement with the government over securities fraud charges was too lenient and they have maintained that the company should be liquidated rather than reorganized but people not associated with the three companies said the justice department was taking the accusations seriously and had opened a fraud investigation that is being supervised by the united states attorney 's office in manhattan brad burns a spokesman for mci issued a statement this evening that did not address the accusation about redirecting government calls but questioned its timing and the motives behind it we have yet to meet with the us attorney 's office so it would be impossible and inappropriate for us to respond to any specifics surrounding their inquiry mr burns said that said we are only one month from our bankruptcy confirmation hearing and expect a final decision on our government contracts in the upcoming weeks you ca n't help but to question the timing and motives of our competitors who are trying to create a difficult environment for us right before our planned emergence from chapter 11 the federal government is near completion of a review to determine whether mci which entered bankruptcy after acknowledging that it had committed accounting fraud should be barred from winning new government contracts as mci 's largest customer the government provides the company with 700 million to 1 billion in business annually the inquiry into the diverted calls could jeopardize that business one method of avoiding the access fee payments which former mci technicians said had been known within the company as project invader or project scorpion involved the use of small telephone companies to make the long distance calls appear as local ones so that the charges would not be levied according to former mci executives they say the other method known as the canadian gateway project involved diverting domestic calls to canada and then back to the united states through att lines so that att would have to pay access fees the senior att executive said att intended to alert federal investigators and the bankruptcy court overseeing mci 's chapter 11 proceeding that it had found evidence of domestic calls redirected through canada from the united states agency for international development the federal deposit insurance corporation the national transportation safety board the pension benefit guaranty corporation the united states postal service the library of congress and other agencies the executive said att technicians had found that domestic calls from the office of at least one member of congress had also been redirected through canada the volume of the diverted telephone traffic is not known the executive said but att also has evidence it will present to the bankruptcy court on monday that a major customer it lost to mci had had its domestic telephone traffic diverted through canada and then onto an att line so that att had to pay the access charges executives at verizon are also said to be planning to take steps to try to put mci 's government contracts in jeopardy a verizon executive said today that the company was planning to send a letter soon to the general services administration which oversees government contracts that will question whether the government should continue to do business with mci the letter will say that if mci passed on any cost savings to the government from avoiding the access charges verizon could have claims against the government the executive said adding that if mci did not pass on the savings the government might itself have been defrauded by mci last week verizon agreed to drop its fight in bankruptcy court to liquidate mci in exchange for a 60 million settlement of its claims the settlement did not preclude verizon from trying steps outside the bankruptcy proceeding that would hinder mci 's reorganization plan

 at the start of this tale five years ago a connecticut priest is wandering in siena a walled city in tuscany a mix up occurs coincidence or is it divine providence fills the middle of the story by the end on july 2 the priest and his now triumphant tale will have galloped full circle back to siena scene i the rev john giuliani a birkenstock shod zenlike catholic priest and prominent artist nosing about siena 's narrow streets stumbles into a bacchanalian parade reminiscent of the romans horses banners hundreds of shouting strutting men who clearly are celebrating a victory welcoming arms yank the priest into the parade celebrants shout it 's him he has arrived he is here the throng calls him joe he is marched to a grand chapel where a banquet is spread before him he is baffled he thinks of the date aug 16 it is one day after a horse race has taken place in the city ten political factions called contradas compete each year on july 2 and aug 15 for a coveted prize a banner painted by a famed artist the banner is called the palio the race has typically been more about honor than skill more godfather than national velvet in a country long renowned for its devotion to honor and family moreso than horses father john alone in siena has by fate or coincidence suddenly become a favorite son of the victors but why he stands before the banquet hall and says kindly but firmly to the man who first embraced him sir my name is not joe it is giovanni yes yes the man mauro finetti said indulging him whatever you want to call yourself more conversation and questions and father john realizes he is in a mess the throng has confused him with that year 's palio painter joe tilson a prominent british artist father john is known enough in the states he has had well received exhibitions at the cathedral of st john the divine in manhattan the aldrich museum of contemporary art in ridgefield the new britain museum of american art universities and churches sprinkled throughout but he knows that this day in siena he is not the artist they think he is the son of an italian shoemaker from greenwich a priest whose burbling laughter is a contagion to anyone within earshot he is though and always has been an honest man embarrassed and perplexed he excuses himself and hikes up the hill to the church of st catherine he looks up at the crescent moon and says aloud as the faithful are wont to do when trapped in a breach of etiquette what do i do he decides to tell the truth the story might have ended there if father john had known his way around siena but he was lost and could not find the chapel where the winners were partying he wandered and wandered the biblical similarities not lost on him and finally found his hotel scene ii father john returns to his home the benedictine grange a 15 acre monastery in redding he writes an apologetic letter to mr finetti an architect who was that year 's president of the contrada then he goes back to painting american indian art which is what he does best and because he wants to make reparations for what the united states did to the american indian whom he calls the first spiritual presence in this land he dusts his bountiful collection of american indian and south american icons which were cheap when he started out and are now priced far beyond his meager pocketbook he cooks cleans mows irons gardens he receives a letter back from italy you are the clone of joe tilson mr finetti writes he apologizes too father john contemplates the incident as he goes about his daily work he holds yogalike meditation sessions with fellow catholics in an ascetic prayer room on the property little suffering escapes his eye in the bridgeport diocese he keeps his grange friends and himself busy with aids ministries the homeless soup kitchens wherever they can help he holds sunday mass in the church a 19th century barn unadorned except for two stained glass windows set high in the rafters that he got for a steal many years ago at united house wrecking in stamford despite his distinctly different approach to the priesthood the diocese leaves him be one day he says to himself hey i 'm an artist why do n't i offer to paint the palio he sends along a packet of his work to siena he receives a polite reply from mr finetti who says he has no authority to select the palio artist father john survives technologically by fax not phone and one day this april his fax machine clicked on and a paper slipped out it was a message from the director of the museum in siena mauro civai his heartbeat quickened which at 69 is n't always a good thing he immediately called mr civai in italy we saw your work mr civai said we would love for you to paint the palio five years had gone by since father john had been misidentified as the 1996 painter of the palio this year the palio that father john paints is dedicated to the 500th anniversary of the birth of a famous sienese botanist piero andrea mattioli when father john heard that he nearly swooned for hanging above the toilet in his little house is a poster a woodcut print of a lavender plant which he hung by a nail when he moved into the house in september 1977 in block letters beneath the woodcut is the name of the botanical artist piero andrea mattioli i 've been living with this man for 24 years now father john said the year i paint the palio is the year it is dedicated to him all these lovely synchronicities move me deeply the siena museum director sent father john a 3 by 9 foot swatch of raw silk on which he was to paint the palio he had a moment of panic he had never painted on fabric before no less fabric with the wrinkled idiosyncratic nature of raw silk he went to a local arts supply store and pleaded for help they comforted him we sell fabric paint they said he had never heard of it final scene on july 2 the horse race will be held father john will be there this year 's celebrated palio artist with a group of friends from the grange community he will stand among the dignitaries of siena watching as two oxen pull the palio in a cart through the city 's streets and watching as the horse race is run the next day the race 's gleeful winners will wave the palio aloft in their parade father john 's telling of the story is like the buildup of waves in a sea calm then gaining in height and power then crash he cracks up with laughter it 's all just too much for me to contemplate he said still laughing i had great joy great joy in doing this then he laughs his infectious laugh again drawing chortles from all about

 anti taliban afghan fighters appeared stalled today in their drive to capture a complex of mountain caves held by osama bin laden loyalists and then begin a full scale search for him there on thursday anti taliban commanders said the fighters moved about two miles forward in a series of fierce skirmishes capturing several caves just above the valley floor and seizing ammunition and at least half a dozen toyota and datsun pickup trucks the favored transport of all afghan fighters but there was little engagement today the commanders conceded the fighters are backed by the eastern shura a government that has replaced taliban rule in the jalalabad area over the past month puffs of smoke along the ridge line less than a half mile from the eastern shura command post suggested that troops loyal to mr bin laden and his terror network al qaeda were using mortar rounds to probe the enemy 's positions by late afternoon several pickup trucks filled with anti taliban troops bounced back downhill along the dirt track away from the front our commander told us to leave to go where it 's safer a young soldier in one of the trucks said the uncertainties of war are particularly evident on this fluid battlefield which is less a front than a number of pockets of conflict sprawled across a river valley the valley leads up to the folds of sharp ridges and on to a horseshoe shaped mountain range whose snow capped peaks mark the pakistan border a picture of the fighting can only be pieced together from the translated cryptic and sometimes boastful remarks of local commanders this may help to explain reports from kabul throughout most of today quoting a northern alliance spokesman as saying that mr bin laden 's headquarters was captured and that the entire cave complex was controlled by anti taliban troops on the ground the reports proved baseless yesterday we captured two caves but we lost them today said a frontline commander hajji moussa even on thursday in the first flush of the advance commander moussa said the fighting would only get more difficult there are 10 to 12 more caves up the valley he said they can shoot from above when we attack them we ca n't get through al qaeda forces estimated by eastern shura commanders at little more than 2000 have the advantage of terrain uphill dug in positions and cave fortresses built with central intelligence agency aid during the war against the soviet occupation in the 1980 's from these positions they can shelter from bombing and artillery and fire down on attackers who must work their way up the steep slopes exposed to danger much of the time american warplanes including giant b 52 's have been heavily bombing the area for eight days and nights continuing today sending huge plumes of smoke higher up the mountains afghan commanders said four american special operations military advisers had arrived at the front on thursday and directed the bombing overnight the american interest is of course piqued by the possibility that mr bin laden could be hiding in the caves but his whereabouts are far from certain the senior eastern shura security chief hazarat ali said this evening that mr bin laden had been seen in the area just three days ago another more junior commander kahan mir claimed that his soldiers had spotted mr bin laden thursday morning riding a horse in the company of a number of bodyguards none of this could be confirmed al qaeda fighters believed to be mostly arabs chechens and pakistanis appeared unlikely to surrender easily without the option of switching allegiance to afghans they may have nowhere to go their radio communications in arabic sounded confident almost cocky at one point taunting their hunters to send us the international forces hit the road hit the road came one radio call directing mortar fire in an attempt to pinpoint the eastern shura soldiers you idiot you missed the red pickup
 republicans maintained their dominance in texas winning races for senate and governor the republican state attorney general john cornyn won in his bid to replace senator phil gramm a republican who is retiring he defeated ron kirk a former dallas mayor who had he won would have been the first black senator from a southern state since reconstruction gov rick perry handpicked to replace george w bush as governor defeated a hispanic businessman tony sanchez who spent 59 million of his own money on his race democrats for long a minority in texas put on spirited races although mr sanchez was not able to excite the state 's large hispanic population and mr kirk did not gain enough black support republicans were determined to maintain control of these two high profile offices and president bush made numerous campaign stops
 the seattle mariners cruised through yankee stadium this week on a hot streak pitching and hitting well playing with a special energy they swept three games from the home team and in doing so they illuminated some of the yankees current problems some subtle some more glaring the yankees made 10 errors in four games their pitching has been ineffective and three of their star position players look uncomfortable center fielder bernie williams rejoined the yankees last week after being away from the team for 11 days and he is struggling to regain his timing going into thursday 's game with seattle williams was 28 for 57 with six home runs against the mariners left hander jamie moyer and yet williams constantly seemed off balance going 1 for 5 since rejoining the team he is 5 for 26 with a double and a homer it 's a strange feeling he said david justice slumped on the recent road trip going hitless in 22 at bats before emerging from that slump and now he is in another he has one hit in his past 16 at bats and is 3 for 20 on the homestand justice sat out wednesday 's game and manager joe torre chatted with him yesterday about the possibility of taking another day off probably tomorrow when the yankees face the oakland left hander barry zito shortstop derek jeter missed the last two weeks of spring training and opened the season on the disabled list because of a thigh strain and it is apparent in his movement that he is still impaired to some degree sometimes he runs the bases in measured strides rather than in his usual all out gallop and several times he has fallen while fielding grounders as he fights to maintain his balance torre acknowledged that jeter might have been hurt by his inability to do much training before the regular season began body control is a big part of what he does torre said his legs are such an important part of every position on the field pitchers without their legs have trouble doing what they need to do shortstops you have to pretty much be acrobatic torre said he thought jeter probably felt the lingering effects of his injury and is controlling his running a little bit picking and choosing his spots to go full speed jeter agreed maybe a little bit but i think i 'm running fine looking but no deal yankees general manager brian cashman would not comment on a published report that suggested alfonso soriano might be traded to cincinnati for second baseman pokey reese but other club officials said there was no chance that such a deal would be made the initial proposal was made by the reds one executive indicated and the yankees are not interested in making the swap just as soriano is beginning his major league career and reese a fifth year player is beginning to make big money the yankees have been checking on the availability of a right handed power reliever and to that end they are monitoring montreal 's ugueth urbina on the sideline christian parker who went on the disabled list with shoulder tendinitis after making just one start during the regular season stopped a throwing session this week he is sidelined indefinitely outfielder henry rodriguez stopped by yankee stadium yesterday as part of his rehabilitation schedule rodriguez hurt his back in spring training and will most likely begin a minor league assignment soon outfielder shane spencer is two weeks into his 20 day minor league rehabilitation assignment and is gradually playing better the yankees could activate spencer from the disabled list next week and use him against some left handed pitchers sharing time with the left handed hitting david justice and paul o'neill but the yankees also have the option of assigning spencer to class aaa columbus barring injuries they will probably be inclined to do that to get spencer regular playing time as he rebounds from the knee surgery he had last summer

 the broad stock market indexes have pretty much fizzled this year so why are many investors smiling because at long last a greater number of stocks are rising today rewarding more of their owners the battle between the haves stocks that are gaining and the have nots is finally beginning to even out therefore despite the paltry performance of the indexes the stock market is a much more promising place to invest now than it has been in some time since march the stock market has become more egalitarian with an increasing number of stocks rising rather than falling said a marshall acuff jr a market strategist at salomon smith barney we 're seeing a rational rebalancing of the excesses in the market mr acuff is referring to the phenomenon of the last two years in which strong performances in the broad indexes were fueled by a small group of stocks mostly big name technology companies last year for example only 31 stocks accounted for the entire 21 percent gain in the standard poor 's 500 in 1995 by contrast 341 stocks were responsible for the index 's 376 percent climb as the indexes ascended in recent years they masked a fairly sick stock market over all now this has begun to reverse even though the indexes look weak the internals of the market are strengthening in wall street parlance the market 's breadth has improved significantly we 're still going to have some high priced stocks mr acuff said but there is improving momentum in the value sector this turnabout owes something to investors optimism that the federal reserve will not be raising interest rates again anytime soon but mr acuff said there were other powerful catalysts for the democratization of the market consolidation is one driver public companies continue to make acquisitions hoping to capture the value hidden in underappreciated shares and big private equity buyers are also increasingly active last friday for example carl c icahn the financier announced his intent to buy more than 15 million in shares of general motors a company whose stock has fallen 27 percent from its april high gm rose 54 percent on the news but its shares still trade at a price to earnings ratio of less than 8 while the standard poor 's index has a p e of almost 30 mr icahn clearly sees gm as undervalued another reason that investors seem to be broadening their stock search is that a number of richly valued companies have recently announced shortfalls in anticipated earnings growth to avoid being flattened by the inevitable stampede out of a stock whose executives have to release such news investors are likely shopping among companies with already diminished growth expectations pleasant surprises are always easier to take than the unpleasant kind the broadening of the market 's rise is most evident in new york stock exchange shares unfortunately breadth in the nasdaq composite has not yet improved this may be because the nyse includes more rate sensitive stocks like real estate investment trusts and preferred shares which have responded favorably to the view that the fed is finished and the small stocks on the nasdaq may remain in the doldrums because they are too liquid for big investors to buy without jolting share prices nevertheless the rising tide that is now lifting more stocks looks to mr acuff as if it has staying power unlike the shift to value stocks in 1998 that was all too fleeting he points out that many of the top performing market sectors so far this year consist of formerly depressed industries that improvement offers hope he said that maybe other areas will catch on as well

 bernie mac still recalls the moment when he was 5 that he decided to become a comedian mr mac who grew up in a poor neighborhood on the south side of chicago said he walked in from the backyard one evening and saw his mother sitting on a chair weeping i climbed on my mother 's lap and i kept saying 'why are you crying said mr mac star of a successful new fox comedy series and she kept saying 'nothing nothing and the more she hugged me the more emotional i got and i was crying too the tv was on and it was 'the ed sullivan show and bill cosby was doing a routine about finding snakes in the bathroom i did n't know what he was talking about but my mother began to laugh she was laughing and crying and i began to laugh i was wiping the tears from her face and i said 'you know what that 's what i 'm going to be just like that guy on tv i told my mom 'you ai n't never going to have to cry again mr mac 44 has spent most of his life trying to make people laugh first at school then on the train in chicago and at parks and finally at clubs and as part of the original kings of comedy tour in 1997 that tour before mostly black audiences sold out across the country and became the subject of a spike lee documentary the tour also featured steve harvey d l hughley and cedric the entertainer mr mac is now seeking to make a leap into national television with the bernie mac show a fictional series that seeks to tap into a persona that is alternately likable witty profane and blunt the half hour show which received mixed reviews has come in no 2 to nbc 's west wing on wednesday night from 9 to 9 30 gail berman president of entertainment at the fox broadcasting company said the network picked up the show immediately after a pitch by mr mac and the writer and executive producer larry wilmore who was also the executive producer of the pj 's an animated series about an urban housing project that ran for two seasons on fox and one on wb mr mac 's series has a strong point of view on a family ms berman said it 's not middle of the road i do n't think it would be appropriate for nbc or abc shows of ours like 'married with children 'malcolm in the middle 'titus 'the simpsons are family shows with unusual points of view mr mac plays a childless married comedian who reluctantly takes in his sister 's three youngsters after she is sent to drug rehabilitation mr mac who is married and has a grown daughter said the show was partly based on reality he and his family took in a teenage niece and her daughter and a family friend cared for the children of her drug addicted sister i wanted to do something about parenting which has been part of my act for years mr mac said over breakfast at a pasadena hotel nowadays parents do n't want to be parents they want to be friends with the kids we always say we want to give our kids more than we ever had but more is not better my aunt her son is 2 years old he 's treated like a grown man 'come on please you have to eat something come on you 're talking to a baby 'you better eat kid or else my grandmother would just look at you she did n't say a word but we did whatever she wanted we were scared of that look the show 's most controversial element and fox executives are uneasy about it is its approach to child rearing the bernie mac character believes in old fashioned discipline and threats when the children misbehave at one point he threatens to bust the older child 's head till the white meat shows addressing the television audience mr mac says when i say i want to kill these kids you know what i mean he and fox executives defend the language saying no one believes he will actually do anything bernie is a chump ok mr mac said his bark is bigger than his bite you can see he 's soft bernie does not hit his kids mr mac said his grandfather used to reach for his belt when children misbehaved but did not use it we 'd beat ourselves up trying to get away he said the success of my comedy has been not being afraid to touch on subject matters or issues that everyone else is politically scared of mr mac said it 's a joke believe me i 'm not trying to hurt anybody he said his threats against the children were as empty as jackie gleason 's yelling to the moon alice gleason is one of his idols a review of the show by neil genzlinger in the new york times said it flirted with offensiveness in a way that is likely to overshadow its good points in the los angeles times a critic called the show bold creative and ferociously witty mr mac himself is flying high in his career although he has appeared in several movies his biggest and most high profile role is as a con man in the new steven soderbergh film ocean 's eleven which is to open on dec 7 mr soderbergh said he cast mr mac after seeing him in the kings of comedy film i thought he was hilarious mr soderbergh said i also thought he had something beyond the ability to do great stand up he said that although mr mac was untrained as an actor he was naturally gifted he listens when he 's performing he 's very intuitive and very sensitive to what 's happening in a scene and he has a very strong presence a natural one mr soderbergh said he has a lot of range i would n't hesitate to cast him in a drama mr mac said he drew his material from his own bleak background he was reared mostly by his mother and grandmother one brother died in infancy another died of a heart attack at 26 his mother died of cancer which she hid from the family when mr mac was 16 his closest friend was shot to death in 1985 by a girlfriend being a comedian is really about pain he said it 's about being able to reach where there 's nowhere else to go you never see a comedian who was born rich like you never see a boxer who grew up in beverly hills the hunger the drive the desire is not there
 plans for a celebration of the 10th anniversary of german unity on oct 3 have turned into a fiasco revealing the enduring divisions of the country and the wretched state of the christian democratic party helmut kohl who as chancellor seized the opportunity to unify the country after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 announced this week that he would not attend an official celebration in dresden the city that was a center of the dissent that led to the crumbling of east germany the reason he gave was that the occasion should be a day of the people many of whom courageously took to the street under the banner 'we are one people and so laid the groundwork for this miracle at such a moment he added personalities should not take center stage magnanimous words but the fact is many personalities will be in dresden including the french president jacques chirac and mr kohl 's absence will leave a hole as large as the man himself behind his decision lies a festering rancor at his treatment by the party he dominated for many years since the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall last year when mr kohl took center stage along with with george bush and mikhail s gorbachev the former chancellor has suffered an astonishing fall from grace precipitated by a party financing scandal his eclipse seems to have left the christian democrats rudderless commenting on the looming debacle in dresden the conservative frankfurter allgemeine said mr kohl can not be filtered out of the recent history of the 'party of german unification if anything tangible is to be left at all what has been very tangible this summer is the personal bitterness within the party kurt biedenkopf a veteran christian democrat and as state premier of saxony the organizer of the dresden event was instrumental in engineering the replacement of mr kohl as party leader by angela merkel this year this has not been forgotten by mr kohl who has refused to comply with the law by naming donors who provided the christian democrats with more than 1 million in effect by turning down mr biedenkopf 's invitation the former chancellor has taken revenge he has shown how large his shadow still looms over a party that trails the governing social democrats by close to 10 percentage points in most opinion polls and shows little sign of revival under ms merkel for weeks now senior party figures have been bickering over whether mr biedenkopf insulted mr kohl by inviting him to dresden but not inviting him to speak friedhelm ost a senior party member said this sort of invitation amounted to an affront wolfgang bosbach another leading christian democrat suggested the squabbling was such that germans might begin to think that gerhard schroder the current chancellor was the father of reunification the arguments have been sharpened by the fact that lothar de maiziere the last leader of east germany as it struggled to sustain itself while abandoning communist party rule has been invited to speak in dresden in part this decision reflects the widespread bitterness that was evident in the east of the country last year when initial planning for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall excluded any figures from the former communist state as in many things east germans felt excluded in the end joachim gauck a former leader of the protests in the east was invited to speak and famously remarked of germany 's difficult unification we dreamed of paradise and woke up in north rhine westphalia this time mr de maiziere has been high on the guest list from the outset but conservative members of the christian democratic party have been making much of unproven suggestions that he was long in the pay of the east german state security service the stasi edmond stoiber the state premier of bavaria said this week that it was incomprehensible that mr de maiziere be invited to speak when mr kohl had not been the arguments over mr de maiziere have illustrated once again the difficulties of the eastern and western parts of the country in understanding each other unemployment in the east about 17 percent is still twice that in the west and a bitter sentiment persists in many depressed eastern areas that unification amounted to a western takeover in which 17 million east germans became second class citizens in a letter to mr biedenkopf the former chancellor who will attend a low profile celebration organized by a foundation close to his party in berlin on sept 27 alluded to these problems but insisted that the hopes of 1990 had been fulfilled even with all the political difficulties and economic burdens of the first decade of reunification i still feel great joy at this event mr kohl wrote today the hopes of a decade ago have become a reality and 'we are one people one people but with at least two celebrations in recent weeks the governing social democrats have made it clear they will hold their own commemoration of unification at the world 's fair in hanover on oct 3 to be attended by chancellor schroder after he leaves dresden
 the philippine president gloria macapagal arroyo paid a call today on her ousted predecessor joseph estrada in his jail cell two days after his supporters stormed her residence saying she wanted to check on mr estrada 's well being mrs arroyo agreed to provide him with an air conditioner and curtains but the visit also seemed calculated to mollify the former president 's partisans who exploded in fury after he was arrested last week on corruption charges they 've been brainwashed into hating mrs arroyo said in an interview afterward at the presidential palace i consider them as victims more than as assailants and that 's why i would like to reach out to them mrs arroyo said she planned to visit estrada supporters who were detained on tuesday after their march on the palace was repelled by soldiers in a fusillade of gunfire resulting in four deaths if i can visit as many of them as i can i would like to do that she said i am going there with an open heart it was the first time mrs arroyo had met mr estrada since she resigned from his cabinet six months ago after a bribery scandal engulfed the actor turned politician the ertswhile allies traded small gestures he expressed sympathy for the stress she suffered during the palace siege she extended his visiting hours the contrast to the arrest of mr estrada at the hands of gun toting policemen was stark and it suggested that mrs arroyo was eager to mend fences with poor filipinos who are among his strongest backers and were greatly angered by his treatment i want to move on mrs arroyo said even as she relished her recent victory in the extreme sport that is philippine politics moving on might be difficult although the streets of manila were calm for a second day the capital remains in the state of rebellion mrs arroyo declared on tuesday to round up opposition leaders whom she accused of instigating the assault seven of those people remain free including an outspoken senator miriam defensor santiago who protested that mrs arroyo had actually instituted a state of virtual martial law senator santiago brandished a pistol at a news conference threatening to use it if the police tried to arrest her mrs arroyo said she planned to lift the state of rebellion which grants the authorities the power to arrest suspects without a warrant on monday but she did not rule out a further crackdown if the leaders she described as power grabbers mounted another assault on her government if they attempt it again then we will hit them again and defeat them again she said business and church leaders applauded the president 's tough approach which they say prevented an unruly mob from setting off a national crisis but there is lingering uneasiness here and not just among mrs arroyo 's opponents about her use of the rather nebulous concept of rebellion to arrest political rivals there is a suspicion that the police could abuse this ambiguous law said randolf s david a political analyst mrs arroyo who kept a well thumbed copy of the constitution at her side during the interview said declaring a state of rebellion was a necessary political tool to prevent the country from sliding into chaos i had to run after the coup plotters the power grabbers she explained and you ca n't run after them unless you declare a state of rebellion and declare them as rebels it 's not a matter of emotion it 's a matter of a step that has to be taken so that i can enforce the law the government 's crackdown came less than two weeks before crucial legislative elections senator santiago filed a motion today demanding that the ballot be postponed because one opposition candidate jose ponce enrile was in prison while two others were the object of manhunts mrs arroyo dismissed suggestions that the election be delayed she said the politicians who fomented the insurrection were lagging in the polls and wanted to overthrow her as a way to cling to power considering that they came within a stone 's throw of succeeding mrs arroyo looked remarkably composed today she described how her security agents hustled her from room to room in malacanang palace early tuesday morning as a crowd of 40000 chanted down with gloria and battled with soldiers outside whenever she entered an open area she was asked to wear a bulletproof vest mrs arroyo is the daughter of a former president diosdado macapagal and lived in the palace as a child she said she knew hidden passages she could have used if the crowd had pierced the gates despite her popularity with many filipinos mrs arroyo 's claim to the presidency is fragile given the way she ascended to power from the vice presidency a populist uprising not unlike the one her soldiers just put down there will always be part of the population that does not regard her as a legitimate leader but today mrs arroyo got an endorsement from an unlikely source mr estrada who insists he is still the rightful president said to her in tagalog it 's a good thing our president is visiting us he did address me as that she said with a broad smile correction may 5 2001 saturday an article yesterday about a visit by the president of the philippines gloria macapagal arroyo to her jailed predecessor joseph estrada misstated the given name of a leading opposition politician who was detained this week after an unsuccessful uprising by mr estrada 's supporters he is juan ponce

 after a day of speeches denouncing gun violence and praising the constitutional right to bear arms the house of representatives easily passed a bill today limiting lawsuits against the firearms industry the measure now goes to the senate where it already has enough sponsors to win a majority vote but neither side is sure it has the 60 votes to prevail against a filibuster promised by democrats the bill would take away one of the chief weapons used by advocates of gun control who have joined with cities and victims of guns in filing more than two dozen lawsuits seeking damages from the industry for making unsafe guns and allowing guns to fall into criminals hands it makes gun manufacturers and dealers immune to lawsuits seeking damages resulting from the misuse of their products by others the bill was passed 285 to 140 with 63 democrats joining the republican majority it already has 52 sponsors in the senate including 9 democrats but it has determined foes we 'll do everything we can to fight it including a filibuster said senator dianne feinstein democrat of california representative f james sensenbrenner jr republican of wisconsin and chairman of the judiciary committee said we should n't use the judicial process to bankrupt an industry that produces a legal weapon a legal product although the legislation would still allow lawsuits against gun makers and dealers who knowingly and willfully violate the law critics said most victims of guns would be shut out of court shielding gun makers dealers and distributors from liability and dismissing all pending lawsuits is the most egregious form of corporate welfare i 've yet to see said representative rahm emanuel democrat of illinois this is special treatment for special interests while representatives from urban districts rose to tell stories of individuals hurt by guns those from rural districts expounded on the constitutional right to bear arms the republican majority was joined by democrats like representative artur davis of alabama who was elected last year after criticizing his opponent for siding with the national rifle association too often i 'm in favor of trigger locks and disagree with the nra on some issues mr davis said but i happen to think that the nra has a point on the issue of lawsuits if you 're hit by someone driving a car at 90 miles an hour i do n't think you should sue general motors for making a car that someone else uses to break the law since the bill was sponsored by a majority of house members its passage was ensured and the majority easily defeated amendments offered by democrats the chief drama of the day turned out to be a dispute over a remark by representative barbara cubin republican of wyoming while she was discussing a proposed amendment allowing a lawsuit against a dealer who sells a gun to someone who uses or is addicted to illegal drugs gun makers and dealers have long argued that they can not be expected to recognize on sight which customers are dangerous and that trying to do so would expose them to other kinds of lawsuits for illegally discriminating against people based on how they look or where they live ms cubin began to make that argument by mentioning her two adult sons they 're blond haired and they 're blue eyed she said one amendment said we could n't sell drugs to anybody that was on drugs or had had drug treatment or something like that well so does that mean if you go into a black community you ca n't sell any gun to any black person or does that mean if my sons because they look like whereupon she was interrupted by representative melvin watt democrat of north carolina mr watt who is black asked that she be punished for inappropriate language but his proposal was defeated largely on party lines ms cubin later apologized on the floor for her remark the republicans refusal to discipline her was criticized by representative robert t matsui democrat of california who called her words racist

 the seattle mariners have 26 victories this season but none of them include their local ratings triumphs in prime time over dramas and comedies like west wing frasier the seattle radio shrink who would not know where safeco field is and survivor playing in a popular new ballpark before a well heeled populace and featuring a group of likable players that includes the hitter known as ichiro the mariners are the top rated team in major league baseball far higher than the yankees mets dodgers or cubs their 157 cable rating on fox sports northwest is 69 percent better than the 93 rating for the no 2 team the cleveland indians the city stops for a game said tracy dolgin president of fox sports net which includes fox sports northwest among its 21 regional affiliates the only equivalent is the packers in green bay remarkably although the seattle market is less than one quarter the size of new york mariners games are drawing more households a game than the mets or yankees the mariners are in essence a daily reality series starring lou piniella as the wise former hell raiser from tampa fla ichiro suzuki as the mysterious lovable superstar hitter whose utterances in japanese are examined for their profundity and ruben sierra as an odysseus like character returned from his travels with his batting skills restored the mariners are as real as mtv 's osbournes they live at safeco field which is about the same size as the house ozzy et famille inhabit in beverly hills calif the mariners deftly wield bats that are swung ozzy once ate bats that fly we used to get pretty good ratings when people tuned in to see how badly they could screw up said dave niehaus who has called nearly all mariners games on radio or television since their creation in 1977 the mariners ratings potency was on vivid display last tuesday when they lost to toronto 4 1 the game rated a 161 or 265204 households the broadcast network program closest to it frasier produced a 136 on the local nbc station last wednesday the mariners rallied in the bottom of the 10th inning to beat the blue jays 5 4 the game generated a 191 rating which equals 314950 households nbc 's west wing its closest pursuer was 68 percent behind with an 116 locally on that night in the new york metropolitan area the giants mets game on the msg network received a 21 rating or 154782 households which was dwarfed in its time period by a 162 for west wing and a 169 for law order on the local nbc station one of the highest rated mariners games of this season on april 17 against oakland produced a 192 locally the no 2 program law order drew a meager 96 each seattle market rating point equals 16472 cable households regardless of the time the mariners play they invariably win their time slot when they played the yankees in new york on may 5 a 10 am starting time in the pacific time zone the game chalked up a 172 fox sport northwest is paying dearly to carry the mariners a new deal that began last season paid the team 37 million one of the steepest payments in baseball the previous year the fee was 18 million the cable channel carries 107 games a broadcast channel kiro tv is showing 35 at least a good thing happened when we paid this dolgin said they invested it in the club exactly why the mariners are such a dominant television attraction is not a feat of magic merely of alchemy the team except for losing years in 1998 and 1999 has been improving enough to weather losing randy johnson ken griffey jr and alex rodriguez and it got well in time for the opening of safeco field in mid 1999 then seemed to be touched by fairy dust when suzuki joined the team last season suzuki 's stellar rookie season was the main engine for the 59 percent rise in last season 's ratings there 's a huge japanese american population here said mark shuken general manager of fox sports northwest which sold a package of home games to japan 's nhk network because of suzuki and is working on a deal to beam games to hawaii the team does not break out the demographics of its japanese japanese american or asian american fan base about half of its fans come from outside king county where seattle is located and where 10 percent of the population is asian we work with japanese travel companies now howard lincoln the chairman of the mariners said until this started when the typical japanese tourist thought of going to the us it was san francisco or los angeles now we 're getting a huge number of japanese tourists and the reason is the seattle broadcasts and the mariners have become the baseball team of the northwest with games also seen in portland ore and vancouver british columbia they have no baseball competition to the north and nothing to the east for 500 miles rick burton the director of the warsaw sports management center at the university of oregon said and there 's no team to the south until you get to san francisco their appeal has a really wide circle but even within its local circle the mariners have the advantage of being in a less cluttered market than new york which has one of the wealthiest populations in the country with the seahawks and supersonics there are only three major league teams in seattle but the market is strongly collegiate with the washington huskies and washington state cougars it 's been huskies town not a seahawks town rodney fort an economics professor at washington state in pullman said when you go to husky stadium you see that they expect the rose bowl but now with the mariners renown surpassing anything the entertainer danny kaye and his partners could have envisioned when they acquired the expansion franchise in 1976 lincoln said the mariners are the most popular team in the region because we play every day bigger than the huskies football team which won the 2001 rose bowl lincoln could be partly right compare the mariners 157 average to some of last year 's huskies games on abc the local rating when the huskies played michigan last sept 8 was a 147 the oct 13 game at ucla rated a mere 71 while a nov 17 washington washington state game matchup produced a 197 seattle is a wonderfully supportive sports town gary barta the senior associate athletic director at washington said given their success it 's no surprise the mariners are getting the support they 're getting and that support especially on television would be the envy of george steinbrenner the principal owner of the yankees on his new yes network still without a deal with cablevision and its three million households the games are getting a 22 rating or 160623 homes on that score the mariners own the yankees

 in 2001 the publisher simon schuster signed a 500000 contract with michael pellegrino a las vegas resident who claimed to be the illegitimate grandson of the late mafia boss carlo gambino in return mr pellegrino using the pseudonym michael gambino delivered a novel called the honored society which pocket books a division of simon schuster published last november the book was marketed as the work of the highest ranking mob member ever to record the innermost workings of the mafia but now simon schuster contends mr pellegrino is not who he says he is the publisher has sued both the author and the agency that represented him saying they committed fraud by giving him a far darker criminal history than he actually had simon schuster filed the suit in federal district court in manhattan in february but not until this week four days after the publisher took the unusual step of filing a second federal fraud suit against the agency artists management group the los angeles talent company founded by michael ovitz did the publisher disclose publicly that it believed that it had been deceived mr pellegrino 's lawyer contends pocket books owes his client the last 100000 of his book advance and has countersued to receive it the lawyer leon friedman said last night that mr pellegrino had fulfilled his contract by writing the book he had promised nothing in the contract made reference to mr pellegrino 's biographical claims the lawyer said another lawyer for mr pellegrino gus flangas of las vegas said that mr pellegrino does believe he is the illegitimate grandson of carlo gambino as he has been told since childhood mr friedman questioned why the author 's biography should matter anyway why do you publish a book he said because it 's got literary quality or because we can advertise this as the grandson of carlo gambino what 's important in publishing these days a spokeswoman for mr pellegrino 's agent joel gotler said he would not comment on pending litigation simon schuster 's lawsuit against the agency was reported in the new york post yesterday according to adam rothberg the spokesman for simon schuster questions about michael gambino and his authenticity surfaced after publication of the honored society by pocket books he would not say who raised the questions over the course of time neither gambino nor his agent were able to provide us with satisfactory proof of his bona fides mr rothberg said some time after publication of the book mr rothberg said it was withdrawn the online bookseller amazoncom lists the honored society as out of print mr rothberg did not comment on the extent to which the publisher checked mr pellegrino 's contentions criminal records in clark county nev show that the author was sentenced to a minimum of 19 months in prison in november 1999 on felony theft charges mr flangas his lawyer said the charges involved the misappropriation of a 2400 rental deposit as part of its marketing campaign simon schuster arranged for michael gambino to be interviewed on abc 's good morning america in december during the interview the author told charles gibson that writing the roman a clef helps me cleanse my soul mr gibson described his guest as a member of the most powerful crime family in new york lisa finkel a spokeswoman for good morning america said that abc learned of the publisher 's doubts only on tuesday we were pitched this book from a reputable publisher with whom we regularly do business and reported on it in good faith she said in a statement yesterday we learned only yesterday that the publisher now believes that the author is a fraud and we started looking into the story as soon as we learned about the lawsuit we plan to follow up on the story as soon as we have all the facts judith m curr the president of pocket books is vacationing in sydney australia near her hometown she did not respond to two messages left on her phone there asked why simon schuster had taken the unusual step of suing the talent agency mr rothberg the simon schuster spokesman said this is an extraordinary step but we felt we had no other recourse he added for us the larger issue here is that we do hundreds or thousands of deals a year with agencies we need to be able to rely on them to bring us authors and literary properties that are authentic and as billed without that reliability the whole relationship of the whole business collapses the lawsuit against the agency contends that it contacted simon schuster a division of viacom telling the publisher that mr pellegrino was a crime boss of one of the most respected and feared crime families in the world and that he had served 12 years in a federal penitentiary claims repeated in publicity releases according to mr flangas the nevada lawyer for mr pellegrino his client had been charged in two separate state cases more than three years ago pleading guilty to the theft charges the question of how much to trust an author and how much to check any contentions perennially bedevils publishers it has been a rough year for simon schuster in another area one of its authors doris kearns goodwin has been under fire for inappropriately copying passages in a book she wrote in 1987 another simon schuster historian stephen e ambrose acknowledged in january that he had inadvertently copied sentences and phrases in his best selling book the wild blue from another historian 's earlier work

 dianne reeves this jazz singer finally got around to making a small group acoustic album but a little moonlight blue note is nearly as ponderous as her other albums astride the jazz pop fault line when she wants to swing hard and efficaciously she can it happens on the title track more often however her voice is frustratingly confined to the pedestal she has built for it still the simple fact of a small band is a good thing to hear this colossal precisely aimed voice skipping down scales not skimping on any of the notes along the way and with so few other instruments intruding on it is to hear good singing gaby kerpel mr kerpel is the argentinean composer responsible for the what country is this from music that accompanies the de la guarda troupe the gravity defying dancers and acrobats who run along walls and ceilings on carnabailito nonesuch he takes bits of argentine music most of which he plays and samples himself and alters them digitally into dream material you do n't really know where it comes from or what purpose it serves he replicates the nasal singing and rough playing of south american folk styles using instruments like cavaquinhos and wooden flutes and slows it down to wrap all kinds of backward sounding samples around it the record 's overall production is by gustavo santaolalla who records instruments cleanly and spaciously it 's an album in the same school as those by the latin playboys the los lobos side project produced by tchad blake messy mesmerizing a spaced out intellectualization of cultural roots papo vazquez carnival in san juan cubop ubiquity the new album by the latin jazz trombonist papo vazquez and his group pirates and troubadours also manipulates cultural roots mr vazquez has divided his life between new york and puerto rico playing and composing in the island 's three century old bomba and plena rhythms and moving them up into a more modern rhetoric of latin jazz so the album is full of rich heavy drumming but mr vazquez 's strong highly rhythmic trombone style and its able interactions with a rhythm section produce some of the best latin jazz around jason moran but letting go of history if done judiciously can produce good music too one of the fascinations of mr moran 's work over the last two years is simply the sound of it its textures and dynamics nasheet waits 's drums spit and mumble rarely acceding to a cycle of groove tarus mateen 's acoustic electric bass has a twangier weedier sound than the double bass he used to use and mr moran 's playing keeps heating up and dissipating as the collective improvisations roll along so i find i have to keep adjusting the volume when i listen to the bandwagon the new live recording by his trio on blue note jazz records in the main are n't supposed to fluctuate like that but mr moran is not worrying about being background for your dinner the inclusion of pieces by brahms and afrika bambaataa in a set recorded live at the village vanguard as well as one composed by transcribing a telephone conversation in turkish are further signs of a feisty relationship with jazz decorum i like the idea that jazz can be responsible to what it 's always done best rhythm expressed through a savvy adult social sophistication while proceeding unrestrictedly in the pursuit of different sounding records there are few if any visionary producers in jazz like mr santaolalla to help the musicians the musicians have to control the ideas the execution and the representation on disc all of which makes mr moran 's accomplishment that much more remarkable terry hall and mushtaq mr hall who used to be the singer in the specials has one of the unforgettable voices in british pop the specials made great high energy ska but what really established mr hall as an expressive singer were regretful dirges recorded toward the end of the band 's life like ghost town and friday night saturday morning in the hour of two lights astralwerks a new album he collaborates with mushtaq from the british asian band fun da mental mr hall has an amateur 's admiration for middle eastern music and was emboldened to make the record by the pop star damon albarn 's recent collaboration with malian musicians mushtaq set up tape loops added furious hand drumming and had a battery of musicians play instruments like oud ney and shehnai over the rhythm bed and there it is again that wonderful quavering voice of knitted brow uncertainty coming not just from mr hall but from the middle eastern singers who appear on the record
 a neo nazi gunman who tried to kill president jacques chirac during the bastille day parade on sunday was committed to a psychiatric hospital today pending the outcome of a judicial investigation to determine whether he was criminally responsible for his actions at the moment of the shooting the man maxime brunerie 25 an accounting student and part time chauffeur was wrestled to the ground by spectators and police officers after he fired one shot at mr chirac from a 22 caliber hunting rifle at the time the french leader was being driven in an open jeep down the champs elysees toward a reviewing stand at the place de la concorde the attack the first attempted assassination of a french president in almost 40 years has prompted calls for an immediate review of mr chirac 's security arrangements as well as demands for tighter gun control mr brunerie needed no permit to buy his rifle he was supposed to register it but had not done so but in general reaction has been surprisingly calm with one center right paris daily newspaper le figaro not even leading its monday edition with the incident mr chirac 's response to news that a shot had been fired at him was also nonchalant ah bon oh really today he telephoned four parade spectators to thank them for their intervention their courage and their sang froid in tackling mr brunerie the most disturbing element of the attack for many people is mr brunerie 's link to the extreme rightist and neo nazi groups that operate in the shadows of french political life although the police expressed the belief that he acted alone they quickly made public his membership in a thuggish student band called union defense group as well as in radical unity a group known for its negationist anti semitic and anti american views this group is in turn associated with the french european nationalist party an openly neo nazi group with connections to similar groups elsewhere in europe the incident has also increased fears that violence is becoming part of europe 's political reality two months ago the far right dutch leader pim fortuyn was murdered just days before crucial parliamentary elections in march marco biagi a lawyer preparing controversial labor legislation in italy was murdered by a group claiming to be on the far left today in a telegram of support to mr chirac the german chancellor gerhard schroder said that the right wing extremist backdrop of this abominable attack again shows how seriously we must take the threat it represents but whether or not his associations played a part mr brunerie 's action on sunday was clearly premeditated he bought the rifle on july 6 he rented a car to drive to paris on sunday and he even posted a message on a far right english language web site urging people to watch the bastille day parade i 'll be the star he said he then brought the gun to paris in a guitar case after his arrest the police said that he had admitted wanting to kill mr chirac to save france and that he had then planned to commit suicide this evening paris prosecutors said he had been committed to a psychiatric hospital outside paris because of the danger he poses to himself and others at the same time opening a judicial investigation will enable experts to determine his fitness to face trial for attempted murder prosecutors said a decision is expected within a month in march 2001 mr brunerie ran in municipal elections on the ticket of the national republic movement a legally registered far right party headed by bruno megret who broke with jean marie le pen 's larger national front four years ago mr brunerie won only 29 percent of votes cast but his candidacy linked mr megret 's party to still more extreme rightist groups radical unity for example backed mr megret in the first round of presidential elections this year and supported mr le pen in the runoff vote won overwhelmingly by mr chirac today mr megret condemned the assassination attempt as an odious and senseless act and described mr brunerie as by all evidence a psychiatric case mr le pen was more dismissive noting that i quite expected that if there was a madman they 'd find a way of saying he was from the extreme right a statement on the web site of radical unity said that it is not up to us to condone or excuse his act but simply to assure him in his present distress that comradeship is not for us a empty word it added that terrorism was not a solution to the political and moral crisis affecting france the newspaper le monde said mr brunerie had reportedly told two radical unity colleagues of his desire to kill mr chirac but they said they thought he was joking today the police questioned those and other far rightists as well as mr brunerie 's sister his parents who were on vacation in spain returned to paris this evening and were expected to be questioned tuesday mr brunerie lives with them in courcouronnes 20 miles south of paris

 president bush 's proposal to double federal spending on fuel cell research drew praise today from automakers and skepticism from environmentalists our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen and pollution free the president said in his state of the union address on tuesday night automakers view the fuel cell as the technology that will eventually supplant the internal combustion engine and silence environmentalists concerned about smog and greenhouse gases fuel cells generate electricity from chemical reactions between hydrogen and air their only tailpipe emission is water vapor but energy would be required to produce hydrogen to run tens of millions of cars and greenhouse gas emissions might be the result depending on how the hydrogen was produced we think this is a great step in the right direction said christopher preuss a spokesman for general motors the president showing leadership in hydrogen is critical to making the jump we 're very pleased gm has built the most jetsons like prototype fuel cell vehicle called the hy wire all of its drive components are underfoot there is no dashboard and the driver uses handgrips instead of foot pedals toyota and honda have already leased the first tiny test fleets of fuel cell vehicles to the university of california and the city of los angeles respectively but automakers say the technology is not expected to be ready for broader sale before the end of the decade at the earliest and many analysts believe that is optimistic besides the technological challenges that remain for fuel cells themselves particularly the challenge of finding a safer way to store hydrogen which is now stored in highly pressurized tanks there is the daunting notion of outfitting the nation 's filling stations with hydrogen instead of gasoline environmentalists though enthusiastic about fuel cells in the longer term want to see more aggressive development of hybrid cars those vehicles achieve sharp increases in fuel economy by supplementing gasoline engines with electric motors general motors and the ford motor company have said they plan to join toyota and honda in equipping some vehicles with the hybrid technology the auto industry is using the promise of future fuel cells as a shield against using existing technology to dramatically cut our oil dependence and pollution today said daniel becker director of the sierra club 's global warming and energy program jason mark director of the clean vehicles program at the union of concerned scientists said with oil use increasing at alarming rates president bush should aggressively push conventional technologies that can deliver cost effective savings today as opposed to waiting two decades in his speech president bush proposed 12 billion in additional financing for fuel cell research over five years peter hoffmann the editor of the hydrogen and fuel cell letter said that total federal spending on fuel cells including military spending came to about 230 million a year now mr hoffmann and others said that the first widespread practical use of fuel cells was likely to be in consumer electronics people with cellphones and laptop computers they said will be willing to pay extra to avoid the inconvenience of rundown batteries next would be technology for houses and commercial sites which could make all the electricity they needed from fuel cells that drew hydrogen from natural gas cars would be among the most complex applications because operating an ordinary sedan requires about 10 times as many kilowatts of power as a house carlos ghosn the chief executive of nissan quipped earlier this month that a fuel cell car today would have a sticker price of about 700000 jeremy rifkin author of the hydrogen economy a recent book extolling the prospects of hydrogen power dismissed the president 's proposal as a paltry gesture what is required is a government private partnership on a grand scale with a financial commitment at least equal to the monies currently being spent on homeland security and the preparation for war with iraq he said today the bush administration has set in motion regulations to increase by 7 percent the fuel economy of light trucks sport utilities pickups and minivans by the 2007 model year regulators are considering further action in later years to narrow the fuel economy gap between light trucks and cars but the administration has also been criticized for a tax provision that would permit small business owners to deduct immediately the entire cost of most of the largest suv 's including the bmw x5 and the hummer h2 the administration has said it is reviewing the loophole
 the coffin lay in the city hall rotunda beneath a coffered dome that recalls the pantheon in rome it was flanked by a pair of police officers who stood as rigid as beefeaters in their dress uniforms and white gloves with their shiny leather sam browne belts creaking diagonally across their chests outside the crowd stretched down the stairs past eight metal detectors and up both sides of city hall park to chambers street it was the first time since world war i that a dignitary was honored in death by being allowed to lie in state in city hall the honor was bestowed yesterday on city councilman james e davis not so much for how he lived but how he died assassinated by a political opponent last week at a crowded council meeting inside city hall the doors of city hall were thrown open to all who wanted to pay their respects as long as they agreed to be screened for weapons thousands did from new york 's top officials to city workers to business executives to the children who took part in mr davis 's marches against violence to people from brooklyn who came to know him first as a seemingly ubiquitous candidate and then as a city councilman quite a few of the people who took time off from work and waited patiently in the july heat said they had come to know mr davis only in death some said they were outraged by the manner of his death others said they were inspired by his life story mr davis was a former police officer who started an antiviolence group and then entered politics and several of the mourners the majority of whom like mr davis were black said they came because they were tired of losing promising black role models i 'm not into politics said allison chapman 41 a secretary who met mr davis while he was campaigning in her crown heights neighborhood who used her afternoon break yesterday to say farewell but just the fact that he was a young up and coming african american trying to do right for all people it 's tragic bernice watson said that mr davis was a familiar sight in clinton hill brooklyn where he campaigned door to door he always looked straight at you as if you were the only person that was going to vote for him recalled ms watson 49 a clerical worker for the housing authority every time there was an election i would see him in the neighborhood i always felt like he was going places all told bloomberg administration officials said 7000 people paid their respects city officials say that new york 's city hall is the oldest in the nation still in operation in its nearly 200 years of existence it has been many things the scene of untold hundreds of the pointed and sometimes picayune arguments unique to local government a place for citizens to rally in times of war a welcoming station for visiting dignitaries and a speakers corner of sorts where new yorkers come to air their grievances last week though it became something else a crime scene so mayor michael r bloomberg and the city council speaker gifford miller opened it up yesterday for its first lying in state since 1918 when the honor was given to john purroy mitchel a mayor who was voted out of office and joined the air corps only to die in a training accident it 's a small token of affection that the city can show out of respect for james davis mr bloomberg said yesterday before the viewing james davis tried to make this city better and the ultimate irony is that his whole term in office was trying to work against violence and yet it was violence that claimed his life mr davis 's colleagues on the city council who watched in horror as he was killed last wednesday are a varied group and they paid their respects in varied ways charles barron of east new york brooklyn paused at his coffin and raised a clenched fist in the air john c liu of flushing queens bowed his head yvette d clarke of crown heights brooklyn left a single red rose beside mr davis 's coffin then they went outside to city hall plaza council members embraced wept shared favorite stories about mr davis and relived the frightening details of his final minutes in the city council chamber i 've spent more time in this building with the people in here than i have with my family said a visibly shaken city councilman james s oddo of staten island the council 's republican leader so if you think about the very idea of someone coming into your house shooting one of your relatives that 's how i feel first you feel shock and then that gives way to anger and anger is what i 'm feeling right now mr davis 41 was killed by othniel askew 31 a political opponent he had brought to the council meeting that day and walked past security minutes before the council meeting was set to start mr askew drew a silver colored pistol in the council chamber and shot mr davis seven times in the torso before he in turn was shot dead by a police officer the slain councilman 's mother thelma was the first inside yesterday led gently to the dark cherry wood coffin by mayor bloomberg the mayor held mrs davis 's right hand and put his other arm around her mrs davis 's left hand rested on the coffin then mr miller led in the rest of the davis family including mr davis 's younger brother geoffrey who has said he would like to run for mr davis 's seat mr bloomberg handed out tissues from a small package outside the hall annie stevenson king 66 a retired social worker from crown heights confessed that she did not much like mr davis when she first met him because of his attitude she recalled mr davis retorting that he did not much like her either and after that at every affair he would come over and hug and kiss me and say 'i 'm going to make you like me she recalled with a laugh when i saw the news on tv i just broke down she said there 's so much bad press with young black men and then to see someone who is about change get cut down like that it 's a tremendous loss we are almost conditioned to think that all our black men are doing nothing look at how much he accomplished in his life i think of what martin luther king said 'it 's not how long you live but how well you live she drew a hand to her face as her eyes welled with tears anthony herbert who was mr davis 's rival in the coming democratic primary also came to pay his respects after spending part of the morning at the board of elections a few blocks south of city hall reviewing his nominating forms for the ballot mr davis had challenged his nominating petitions timothy hayes 41 a paralegal who lives in mr davis 's district arrived at city hall at 9 am and found himself 13th in line this is the ground where it all started and this is where it all stopped he said and nadia haywood 27 who teaches mentally disabled children said she took a half day off from work even though she did not know the councilman he was just an ordinary man and he lived in brooklyn he could have been my next door neighbor she said as the extraordinary day came to an end geoffrey davis thanked all new yorkers for the support they have shown since his brother was killed right now he 's saying 'i shook up the world in his own way he said

 harry belafonte the singer and liberal political advocate denounced secretary of state colin l powell in a radio interview this week likening him to a plantation slave who abandoned his principles to come into the house of the master mr powell called the characterization unfortunate in an interview tuesday on station kfmb in san diego mr belafonte offered a broad critique of the bush administration 's dealing with international organizations like the united nations and its handling of civil liberties issues singling out attorney general john ashcroft and secretary powell for special criticism in the days of slavery there were those slaves who lived on the plantation and there were those slaves that lived in the house mr belafonte said according to a partial transcript of the interview posted on the station 's web site you got the privilege of living in the house if you served the master he added colin powell 's committed to come into the house of the master when colin powell dares to suggest something other than what the master wants to hear he will be turned back out to pasture tonight in an interview on cnn 's larry king live secretary powell said i think it 's unfortunate that harry used that characterization if harry had wanted to attack my politics that was fine secretary powell added if he wanted to attack a particular position i hold that was fine but to use a slave reference i think is unfortunate and is a throwback to another time and another place that i wish harry had thought twice about using the state department spokesman richard a boucher had earlier brushed off mr belafonte 's comments saying that secretary powell had smiled when i told him about it he said that mr powell also said that both the irs and his accountant thought he was better off as a field hand earning high lecture fees before returning to government service with the bush administration a senior state department official later said that secretary powell considered mr belafonte a friend despite their obvious and well known political differences in the radio interview mr belafonte criticized the bush administration on a range of issues comparing the tactics of mr ashcroft 's justice department to those of the mccarthy era when families were destroyed neighbors spied on neighbors now he said we find ashcroft cutting in under the guise of catching terrorists suspending liberties and rights he also faulted the administration for its decision to walk out of last year 's united nations conference on race in south africa after it fell into bitter disputes over criticism of israel what colin powell serves is to give the illusion that the bush cabinet is a diverse cabinet made up of people of color when in fact none of that is what is true he said mr belafonte and secretary powell are both of jamaican descent and mr powell is a huge fan of calypso music but on that score the secretary is known to favor the social commentary of the mighty sparrow the calypso king secretary powell has often assured associates that mr belafonte 's calypso style night club performances are not the real thing

 arthur levitt the chairman of the securities and exchange commission wants to end his term by enacting new rules to increase the independence of auditors from their corporate clients this is mr levitt said near the end of a long day of public hearings a cultural change we are talking about auditors are the only profession enshrined in the nation 's securities laws if you want to sell stock to the public you do n't have to hire a lawyer or an investment banker but you do need an independent accountant mr levitt fears that auditors are not sufficiently concerned with assuring that they are seen as independent many in the accounting industry bitterly resent mr levitt 's latest moves which would force the accounting firms to stop providing some consulting services they now sell to companies whose books they audit they say those services make them more familiar with the company and thus able to do better audits and they say there is no evidence that such relationships have led to bad audits today the rules say we must be independent in fact said james e copeland jr the chief executive of deloitte touche in an interview mr levitt is pushing rules that demand independence in appearance he said adding that this caesar 's wife quote is absurd that 's the one that says some people must be above suspicion there probably never was a golden age of accounting independence back in 1957 leonard spacek the legendary managing partner of arthur andersen was warning that the profession 's existence is in peril because it was not showing enough independence he complained that the accounting principle setters of that era yielded quickly when companies complained that a new standard would cut their profits proper accounting principles in this case were not even discussed he moaned he warned that it was dangerous for auditors to be perceived as advocates for their clients rather than impartial fact finders many things have changed for the better since then the financial accounting standards board now sets accounting rules and has exhibited backbone but accounting chief executives talk a different language than spacek did they are very confident that the public has confidence in them and point to high stock prices as evidence that investors trust the financial statements they certify to the extent there is a perception that they lack independence they blame the sec for raising the issue you get the impression everything would be fine if mr levitt would just shut up or go away three of the major accounting firms andersen deloitte and kpmg are determined to fight the new sec proposal they are lining up allies in congress and preparing to go to court they hope to delay action until a new president can appoint a new sec chairman they may win that fight but such a victory would be pyrrhic highly publicized resistance to rules that are described as seeking to promote auditor independence will be remembered when as will surely happen there is another case of an audit gone awry particularly if the auditing firm got far more money from consulting relationships than it did for doing the audit the industry should seek a compromise perhaps one that lets auditors continue to do more information technology consulting than the sec seems to want but with safeguards and fuller disclosures but for now there may be too much anger to allow such talks even to get under way

 until recently this hilltop village considered itself simple but modern now the villagers wonder if they are rolling backward in time a nearly three week israeli blockade has prevented them from leaving town by car except for medical emergencies we are back to the donkey misada abdel rahman srour principal of the elementary school said today there has been no delivery of gas in almost a month so many villagers are cooking over open fires the grocery shelves are sparsely filled so some are going into the fields to pick their dinner and with the health clinic closed because the doctor can not get into their town they have resorted to home remedies and to prayer we could pretend it 's an adventure on a desert island i guess but this little island is in a sea of settlements said sahid samha a palestinian government worker who has been unable to get to his office in 20 days nine miles west of ramallah janiya is a relatively isolated village of about 950 residents that is indeed bordered by jewish settlements on three sides the strict blockade which followed months of less stringent restrictions on movement has seemed a baffling punishment to the villagers janiya claims no martyrs to the recent uprising and is relatively low key politically villagers just assumed that the settlers did n't want them on the roads their children have taken to climbing the village fence and yelling into the wind at the settlers cars that travel freely below palestine yes israel no a group of 9 year old boys shouted in high voices today as third grade girls giggled beside them hiding their faces in the aprons of their pin striped pinafore uniforms janiya has been under palestinian civil control since last year but it remains under the security control of the israelis whose soldiers were positioned today at its outskirts some sat in armored personnel carriers others leaned on cement cubes drinking orange juice out of liter cartons it is total siege here one young soldier said except in cases of illness or pregnancy and there are suddenly a lot of sick and pregnant people in this town villagers say that janiya is known locally and rather precisely as the land of the 102 springs it is unusually green for a west bank town with leafy almond trees and fields of sage and relatively prosperous with daewoos and subarus in the driveways of terraced stone houses for many years the town has enjoyed nearly full employment most of its men worked inside israel or in the neighboring settlements but that came to an abrupt halt after the violence broke out last fall suddenly because of israeli security restrictions to prevent violence and terrorism most of the men were jobless and they began loitering in the rocky streets during the day wondering what to do with themselves it is painful for the men said mr samha who temporarily joined the unemployed after the blockade prevented him from going to work they feel they are without purpose and that they are without value for the last five years naji nidal 33 and a father of four has worked in talmon a neighboring jewish settlement he was a carpenter who built kitchen cabinets at a good clip and earned about 1000 a month now he earns zero he said except for occasional pennies from selling the sage and tomatoes that he grows his israeli boss he said recently called and told him that he was worth five of the romanian workers who had replaced him if you go to a man named yisrael in talmon and ask him who is naji he will tell you that i am the hard working palestinian mr nidal said he had confidence in me he sent me inside their houses with no suspicions at all several nights ago mr nidal 's 2 year old daughter asil upturned a pot of boiling tea burning her chubby little leg mr nidal threw her in his car and nervously approached the israeli checkpoint he said the soldiers signaled for him to turn around it was a tense night in which there had been some shooting on the road mr nidal said that he tried to tell them of his daughter 's injury but he was too nervous to insist that they let him through today asil 's leg was in bad shape red raw and oozing pus flies hovered over her wound her father said he had applied some cream to it and that he expected he would be able to take her to a hospital someday soon by showing her leg to the soldiers mr nidal probably could have passed through the checkpoint but it was clear that he felt defeated by his initial attempt almost everyone in the village has a litany of woes and they are recited more with depression than with anger to most the town 's misery is encapsulated by the death of a 29 year old woman in late january it was a month after she had given birth by caesarian section and she was suffering complications the israeli army said that her death had nothing to do with the way she was handled at the checkpoint but villagers insist that she was delayed so long that by the time she got to the hospital it was too late this is the son of the woman who died mr samha said placing his hands on a 9 year old boy 's shoulders wearing a fish themed back pack the boy froze with the attention he whispered i do n't know how she died in the half empty grocery store which has run out of such staples as flour sugar eggs and chicken ali abu sheikha explained how he got to work until restrictions were tightened a young chemistry teacher who worked in a town 4 miles away he was forced to take an 18 mile roundabout trek by foot and by taxi but a few weeks ago the back roads were blocked too and he gave up only two of the janiya elementary school 's seven teachers live in the village between them they have divided the 128 students and solicited volunteers they have shortened the school day and eliminated sports and arts classes but they said that it would be difficult to control their young students even if they were fully staffed they ca n't concentrate the principal said they want to leave so they can throw stones at the settlers a spokeswoman for the israeli army contacted this afternoon said at first that janiya was not under any kind of restrictions there is no closure at all on that village she said she was urged to check further later this evening lt col olivier rafowicz a senior army spokesman confirmed that the village had been encircled for several weeks as part of general security measures in the ramallah area he said that there was no particular threats from janiya itself and colonel rafowicz added the encirclement will be released it was in fact lifted already a little while ago they can pass with their cars now and so on facing international and internal criticism for tightening restrictions on palestinian movement inside the west bank prime minister ariel sharon said tonight that he would lift internal closures in the west bank where security considerations allow it

 arthur ashe was not one for fig leaves symbolic fig leaves anyway his views regarding human and race relations as well as i recall virtually any other subject were never anything but direct you asked arthur ashe a question and he gave you not only what was on his insightful mind but what was in his heart as well it 's also true however that there is no record of his ever having played naked in a tennis tournament the latter has contributed to some of the controversy regarding that big bronze guy in the tree shaded arthur ashe commemorative garden outside arthur ashe stadium in the national tennis center in flushing meadows corona park so has the musculature it 's more rodin or arnold schwarzenegger than the lithe ashe big bronze guy stands tall 14 feet tall as a matter of fact and without even benefit of a towel around his waist tosses up a ball that has forever disappeared into the sky as he serves what 's that supposed to be a broken tennis racket said rose giaramita a hair stylist from forest hills queens i do n't get the whole thing the racket indeed appears to be sawed off suggesting perhaps something lethal which ashe 's serve often was that 's arthur ashe said isaac manjo a maryland insurance agent that 's crazy it 's a wonderful display it 's a wonderful statement there is a power and a stature to it which reflects arthur ashe said janet cook of philadelphia but i 'm offended by the nudity daniel burgess of freeport ny loathed the statue to such a degree that he handed out copies of a letter drafted to the united states tennis association demanding the immediate removal of the statue he said he had gotten 1000 signatures to no avail the statue stays said judy levering president of the usta the sculpture is not a depiction of arthur it is a representation honoring his legacy and memory some of the confusion may be in that the artist 's name for it is not in the garden 'soul in flight we probably should fix that art is always in the eye of the beholder you read it here first and art objects can have such emotional affect that they are sometimes defaced or defamed or conversely seen as depictions of faith in front of the united center in chicago an iconic sculpture of michael jordan soaring for a dunk shot has been generally hailed people throw coins at the foot of it as though it were a wishing well but only a few miles away the abstract picasso sculpture in front of city hall drew a different response it 's a heroic monument to some dead dodo a barbary ape or some sort of trojan dove said alderman john j hoellen at the unveiling several years ago dump it in lake michigan he said and put up a statue of ernie banks there is still no statue of banks the former cubs star but many athletes have been memorialized in this fashion and all of them from stan musial in st louis to willie mays in san francisco to dan marino in florida are representational but unlike say michelangelo 's david and eric fischl 's big bronze guy they are also conventionally frocked police officer frank casaburi was assigned to a beat beside the statue my supervisor told me that it 's pretty controversial he said and that some people may not understand it but we 've had no incidents personally i think it 's beautiful while isaac manjo who moved to america from his native liberia was initially put off by the sculpture not being a likeness of ashe he seemed to appreciate the rest of it i get a sense of a man struggling struggling to achieve he said arthur ashe was a role model for me and for many black folks and if it was n't for his struggles the doors would n't have been open for players like venus and serena williams and while many fans were intent on seeing the sculpture it is safe to say that they also had some interest in the other players many of whom were at least 8 feet shorter with more modest pectorals but lleyton hewitt who beat arnaud clement in his quarterfinal match yesterday seemed to encapsulate the general opinion of the players what do you think of the statue what statue he replied the one outside the stadium do n't know anything about it you were just involved in the tennis itself hewitt 's eyebrows narrowed i hope so he said

 runner up lives elizabeth berger senior bronx high school of science bronx 'it 's called garlic bread not garlic toast i say to her when the waiter walks away my mother looks at me blankly here in america we call it garlic bread she looks at me and laughs refusing to be brought down by the sarcasm and rudeness that she 's used to getting from me my parents go out to eat more than any two people i 've ever met and my mother still has n't mastered the art of ordering from a menu it 's strange to sit across from her because it 's like looking into a mirror of myself 35 years later the same uncontrollable curls and green eyes it 's not too bad a reflection my mom can be pretty when she sets her mind to it but usually she does n't it 's a strange feeling to know that you 're destined to take on the physical being of the person who makes you crazier than anyone else in the world my mother 's eyes have gone from laughing to troubled she twists her napkin i roll my eyes because it 's all a game she plays this is her way of forcing me to bring up a topic i do n't want to talk about that way when the screaming is over she can ask what are you so mad at me for you brought it up she is clever i would never deny that what 's wrong mom i ask oh nothing i was just thinking to myself really it 's just too bad about condoms did you know that they 're not 100 percent effective it 's just too bad about condoms i replay the words in my head who speaks like that i was prepared for almost all personal attacks but i was n't prepared for it 's just too bad about condoms in an instant i decide i wo n't let her control this game i will not give any extra information nor will i withhold any necessary information i will come out the winner i did know i start evenly most people do they write it on the box i sit back calmly and cross my arms she 's going over my words one by one but her face does n't even move i know it is the on the box part of my answer that is giving her trouble she 's trying to decide if i know because i like to read condom boxes in drugstores hear about them from friends or am having sex that is really what this conversation is about ask me you coward i silently will her i dare you she starts slowly so i was thinking i smile i 'm ready perhaps the reason that you and your boyfriend have been fighting lately is that you have desirous feelings for each other and um sometimes there 's tension she pauses pleased with herself nope i do n't think sexual i hit the word hard just to make her squirm tension is the problem everybody 's handling their 'desirous feelings just fine we both sit back this is exhausting something about my mother 's face tells me that i should stop this is what she wanted but she 's in over her head so i try and be funny i was showing him this ridiculous handout about 'sexual myths the other day did you know some people believe a girl ca n't get pregnant if she stands on her head while having sex this works my mom laughs a little i guess they think everything 's flowing in the opposite direction she says i guess people also think   she cuts me off and says in hurried voice listen the first time i got pregnant i had n't exactly planned for it your dad was going to write and i was going to act i saw myself becoming a star when i got pregnant i saw my dreams being destroyed so i told your father i did n't know if i wanted to have the baby i told my parents too everyone told me that it was my decision and that they 'd all support me i went to a doctor and she gave me a number to call for an abortion but i could n't call it 's funny to think that i almost did n't have my son it 's weird to think my mom has secrets god i bet you feel stupid you obviously made the wrong choice she smiles anyway i 'm telling you this so you know if you ever got yourself into a situation we 'd all be here for you we 'd get through it if you 'll excuse me i need to use a restroom she stands up i know it 's my turn look mom she raises her hand i 'm not asking for any true confessions here do n't tell me and she walks away so i sit there trying to figure out what just happened it is too much to absorb my mother who has on more than one occasion followed me down the block to make sure i was going where i claimed to be going just made an attempt to speak to me she spoke to me like a person all of a sudden i understood what i had n't got before it was n't fear that kept my mother from asking me directly if i was having sex it was respect and this amazes me she sits down and says maybe instead of seeing a movie you and jackie could do sample sat 's that could be fun yeah that would be great i say i was wondering if it would be possible for you to follow me around all day that way i wo n't have to make a single decision for myself could you pick out my clothes because deciding what to wear is getting overwhelming and just like that we 're back runner up what they were thinking amy papa junior blue

 before it was clear to her that you only have so much time on earth so you had better spend it doing what you love diane reeves sold computers for dell ms reeves 's clients were mostly corporate health care centers she had a degree from the university of texas a husband a young son a house and a career that many might envy so it came as a considerable surprise to those close to her when ms reeves decided a year ago to quit her job pick up stakes and move to new york to become of all things a fashion designer i made huge sacrifices for this ms reeves said last week as she pulled up a stool in brigitte conti 's sewing class at parsons school of design where ms reeves 35 was beginning the first term in a two year program that grants associate of arts degrees in fashion i dragged a husband and a child from texas ms reeves said with a grin and an expression that was far from resigned and i 'm looking for jobs now with salaries that are equal to my bonus at dell few professions it would seem registered the mass cultural chastening that followed the events of sept 11 as sharply as fashion as early as last spring economists were making it plain that the retailing outlook for the foreseeable future was grim it 's tough now said kal ruttenstein the fashion director of bloomingdale 's there are not a lot of new companies opening up established companies are not hiring it 's a tough moment for kids to find work in fashion in america zap following the terrorist attacks the same words and concepts that were once celebrated so lavishly turned up as pejorative terms ostentation frivolity luxury chic who needs those it seemed so frighteningly fateful that everything happened during fashion week the designer cynthia rowley remarked last week it was like a call to attention that the glamour the celebrity the fame and the hype had gotten out of control our priorities were wrong what were those priorities were they to sign on to a system that as the designer john bartlett recently said has gotten distorted to the point where all we 've been seeing are the megadesigners and megamodels and everyone 's ambition is to be mega or is it equally possible that the expectations many people in fashion hold were already pointing toward simpler more straightforward aims fueled by traditional dreams together with the fashion institute of technology also in manhattan parsons is the pre eminent incubator of design talent in the country the alumni roster of the school which was founded in 1896 includes many of those people in fashion who can be identified by a single name donna went to parsons so did calvin tom isaac and marc to name just a few it is easy enough and understandable to buy into cliches suggesting that most people who spend 20000 a year in tuition at parsons hope to forge big fashion careers the kind that include one 's name branded on the waistband of men 's underpants a heavily capitalized initial public offering or at the very least a special on e more and more it seems when i 've done critiques of students work at fashion schools over the past few years the designer anna sui said i 've found that students were focusing only on money you 'd get the sense that they thought designers spent their days draping beautiful fabric on mannequins sketching and then having lunch with their supermodel friends but well before september some fashion insiders say the tenor of the business was already undergoing change what i started telling kids mr bartlett said is that the most creative thing is open a small storefront where you can keep your costs low and it 's much more hands on writing to ingrid bergman the filmmaker jean renoir once noted that the real basis for great achievement is daily humble work within the framework of a profession among the surprises a visitor to parsons school of design recently encountered is how many of its students came to fashion for reasons that would seem familiar to mr renoir before his arrival at parsons from his native thailand werawat lungvedchakarn had already obtained a business degree in bangkok and worked for a time as an accountant at one of his family 's drugstores my brother is a physician mr lungvedchakarn explained my sister is a pharmacist my family wanted me to go into the business but it was like i was forcing myself i tried but it was not me i came to do fashion because it satisfies my passion and my dreams fiona angelini a student from australia quit a decade long international career in the cosmetics industry six of the years spent as a senior marketing executive at revlon to take up fashion studies at parsons eighteen months ago i just said 'this is not filling my soul ms angelini said i was a workaholic before but i work harder at this than i ever have in my life jessica mehta wangled a student visa and special loans to come to new york from india joanne abellera left law school fully aware that people look down on fashion especially now and feel it 's frivolous but i was very unfulfilled and this is the way to feel most creative for me at a social and psychic level thuy diep who is of vietnamese origin decided that fashion was less about sound bites and air time than deep psychic comfort people think of clothes as unimportant ms diep said when of course the act of clothing oneself is an important expression of art typically the students here are the kind of kids who in high school if their parents said 'what do you want to do and they said 'fashion they 'd have said 'you 're crazy explained pamela trough klein the director of parsons fashion program which has 470 students enrolled we 've had kids from wharton we had a guy who was a prosecutor in new orleans they come because they have to they love design lately mr ruttenstein said while some in fashion found themselves questioning the purpose of fashion its creative and commercial viability others have held tight to optimism it 's nice to think that things will change mr ruttenstein said that things will get better and people will be willing to gamble more and adventuresome talent will be hired again ms angelini for one was overcome in september with a conviction that there were few things the world needed less than another person 's concept for a pretty dress i was numb ms angelini said i could n't do any of it but little by little the desire came back the ideas returned and they had a voice in this business whatever the economic climate whatever the world events the only thing you can hope for is that yours is a voice that people will want to hear

 the federal appeals court in san francisco yesterday unanimously upheld most aspects of a california law restricting sales and ownership of the semiautomatic firearms sometimes called assault weapons it rejected a challenge to the law based on recent interpretations of the second amendment by a federal appeals court in new orleans and by the justice department the law enacted in 1989 and broadened in 1999 was challenged by people who owned or wanted to buy such firearms the decision is significant legal experts said not for its outcome which was largely required by earlier decisions of the court but for its extended rebuttal of more recent interpretations of the second amendment the ruling was issued by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in 2001 the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit in new orleans ruled that the second amendment broadly protected the rights of individuals to own guns yesterday 's decision took the contrary view holding that the amendment protects only a collective right to organize state militias judge stephen reinhardt writing for two members of a three judge panel said a rebuttal was warranted because except for the 2001 decision there exists no thorough judicial examination of the amendment 's meaning judge reinhardt described the supreme court 's most extensive treatment of the question in 1939 as somewhat cryptic courts have generally interpreted that decision to support though obliquely the collective rights model in footnotes in two filings with the supreme court in may the justice department reversed a view it had espoused for decades and said the second amendment protected the rights of individuals to possess and bear their own firearms subject to reasonable restrictions judge reinhardt generally considered to be one of the nation 's most liberal jurists concluded that the text and history of the second amendment and judicial decisions interpreting it all supported the view that the amendment protects only the right of the people to maintain effective militias the panel struck down as irrational a provision of the law that allowed retired law enforcement officers to retain assault weapons judge raymond c fisher joined in the opinion a visiting federal appeals court judge frank j magill voted to uphold the law but declined to join in the majority 's discussion of the second amendment in light of precedent in the ninth circuit judge magill wrote it is unnecessary and improper to reach the merits of the second amendment claims or to explore the contours of the second amendment debate

 after bearing the multibillion dollar cost of the war in afghanistan the bush administration is now questioning how much it will contribute to the united nations reconstruction effort in that country officials said the administration was considering paying less than the united states has customarily contributed to postwar reconstruction costs in other countries but members of congress and the state department are arguing to keep the american contribution as generous as possible since the end of the cold war the united states has underwritten large portions of peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts in the balkans cambodia mozambique and many other countries but the cost of fighting the war in afghanistan has already cost tens of billions of dollars we will look at afghanistan in its entirety the fact that we 've made a uniquely large contribution so far and we will contribute appropriately a senior white house official said he added we do have a role to play we do not want to be the people who do the bombing and leave the reconstruction to others the price by world bank estimates could be more than 10 billion for the first five years alone to rebuild schools and roads and communications systems create a health system attack the narcotics problem and underwrite the new government especially the police and justice system to ensure the rule of law typically the united states contributes one fourth of a peacekeeping mission 's costs and has contributed up to one third of reconstruction costs senior european and united nations officials said they had assumed that the united states would pay up to one third of the reconstruction costs with europe paying one third and the rest of the world led by japan picking up the final third it has been an unwritten assumption that this would happen but we would not complain if the united states maybe gave less said a european official as officials prepare for a top level meeting later this week in brussels to discuss reconstruction efforts in afghanistan the federal agency for international development is drawing up the american plans that will be considered there as a candidate and then as president mr bush has showed little enthusiasm for rebuilding other nations an ideological bent that officials say plays into the debate within the administration over the american role in postwar afghanistan for the president the top priority of reconstruction is to ensure that afghanistan never again becomes a terrorist haven officials drawing up the american plans say that means immediate assistance to demobilized soldiers helping them return to the countryside as farmers and animal herders instead of reverting to lawlessness that would undermine the nascent afghan interim government we 've already started planning to ship seed for the next spring planting and live animals to restore the loss of huge portions of the sheep and goat herds said andrew s natsios administrator for the agency for international development after 20 years of war the country is so threadbare that the united nations put together an emergency 20 million fund to underwrite the interim government providing desks computers telephones and salaries this is all part of a broader political message that however long it takes we are committed to a stable democratic government said mark malloch brown of the united nations development program who will oversee the reconstruction the arab and muslim worlds including many countries that are part of the coalition are watching to see if the united states holds to its promise that it is fighting terrorism in afghanistan and not fighting the afghan people and like a mantra administration officials have said they have learned from the soviets war in afghanistan and will not abandon the country this time to prove that point administration officials point to the president 's contribution of an additional 320 million in food and other relief aid to afghanistan during the war and to the united states record as the largest foreign donor to afghanistan even before sept 11 and at this stage of the conflict the president plans to stay the course even though he has yet to decide how much money the united states will contribute said his spokesman ari fleischer given how involved the united states has been in feeding the afghan people the president believes it is the right thing for the united states to remain politically engaged and to help with the reconstruction of afghanistan mr fleischer said today yet even as relief operations are spreading across afghanistan and reconstruction plans begin the administration continues to make the war effort its top priority the pentagon insists that gen tommy franks at central command has the ultimate say over coordinating civilian and military operations on the ground this is going to be an overlapping effort said joseph j collins the deputy assistant secretary of defense for peacekeeping and relief assistance our first priority is to insure noninterference in the war

 before sept 11 john m guillot had composed what seemed to many a song of no commercial value after that day however his song the world anthem seemed to many to be a soothing antidote and it was recorded by a 48 voice chorus with the prague studio symphony orchestra now as numerous groups work on programs to observe the anniversary of the terrorist attack the world anthem a high tech amalgam of the world 's 193 national anthems from the star spangled banner to china 's march of the volunteers to the vatican city 's hymn and pontifical march is being considered for inclusion in ceremonies by peace groups and television networks and at one point was even being considered by the white house in the meantime the anthem was played at a peace conference in dubrovnik croatia and at the peace corps 40th anniversary ceremony at arlington cemetery both in june it was also recorded on a cd by the united states air force band of the rockies for children of military personnel while mr guillot nurtured the anthem from its inception in 1996 the two minute song was actually composed by a computer program renowned for its ability to generate music in the styles of bach mozart and other famous composers i knew that i wanted this to be a validated process and one of the things i was concerned about was people 's perception of who is this guy that he thinks he can write a world anthem said mr guillot a composer and part time music producer during a recent interview at his home i did n't want people to say this is some guy 's interpretation of what the world anthem should be i wanted it to write itself it needed to be a song that was based on the observations and commonalities of all of the national anthems and thus began a mission that has consumed most of mr guillot 's spare time and money since 1996 when he was working as a project manager for a compilation cd of 186 world anthems for the 1996 summer olympics he remembered a time magazine cover he had seen three years earlier that showed a composite face of humanity representing all the cultures of the world i thought we can do this with music mr guillot recalled i knew it could be done i knew that musicologists use formula to analyze music but because of the immense size of the project i wanted to link up with a university or a lab that used computers from then until last september despite rejections and being told repeatedly that there was no commercial value in such a song mr guillot was undeterred even through four layoffs from various jobs he was forced to take out two loans totaling about 10000 he finally found help from prof david h cope who teaches music composition at the university of california at santa cruz when i e mailed him i thought he was going to tell me to go away mr guillot said but he was very kind professor cope who considers himself a musician first is also a computer programmer and has spent the past 22 years perfecting a program he first created in 1980 called experiments in musical intelligence the program composes music by analyzing a database that mr cope puts into the computer which then distills it and produces a new piece of music he has generated four professional recordings with the program professor cope recalled i was intrigued by the fact that john 's need seemed to merge with my program 's potential just perfectly it seemed natural that a computer program that operates in a manner that a mind does was perfect for that sort of unbiased approach to put the 193 world anthems into mr cope 's program mr guillot enlisted stephen bigger a nashville composer and musician with whom he had worked on the olympics cd to help him convert the anthems into a format that the computer would understand mr guillot also gathered all the lyrics which took about three months and sent them to mr cope who then spent several months rewriting the program and putting hyphens between every syllable of all the lyrics in order for the program to work correctly finally after months of preparation and listening to each of the world anthems several times mr cope ran the program several hundred times and in a matter of seconds received several hundred potential world anthems the process was repeated with the lyrics mr cope sent three candidates of each to mr guillot and together they picked what they thought were the best with the musical skeleton of an anthem mr guillot and his collaborator randy kartchner a music arranger in nashville developed an arranged version of the song 's essence after about six months by spring 2000 mr guillot had his anthem and continued his task of finding an interested patron then sept 11 happened j ed goodman a friend of mr guillot 's and the executive director and founder of the mindshare institute and foundation in fort collins colo a think tank that supports socially conscious ideas remembered mr guillot 's desire to create a world anthem mr goodman said what the 11th did was it opened the world 's mind to communication with each other in a positive way and this fit in very well with that the foundation provided a 50000 grant mindshare contacted ted king an entertainment consultant in los angeles my job was to take it from its basic form and create a richer more beautiful and more exciting piece of music said mr king who quickly rounded up 16 professional singers including a soloist aspen miller and the prague studio symphony orchestra we wanted to give it an international flavor a recording was made in one day through a broadband connection in a local studio that linked the symphony orchestra in prague and the singers in los angeles allowing them to perform as if they were all in one room and the world anthem came into being it now has its own web site where listeners can hear an excerpt of the piece wwwworldanthemorg the anthem does not sound like computer generated music it is simple enough that it can be marched to i 've heard it so many times but i still like it professor cope said i can listen to it and find it interesting in new ways that i had n't thought of before mr guillot now has a simple dream what i 'd like to see is some world renowned artist perform this
 do people in big business really believe in free enterprise the latest argument to the contrary comes from airline chief executives who told congress recently that their industry needs relief again from the consequences of 9 11 it would be easy to deride the airlines claims they have already received 5 billion in post terror cash from the government but the truth is that the airline executives are just doing their job which is to maximize returns to investors in other words they are in business to make money and if washington is offering handouts shareholders expect them to be first in line the great paradox of capitalism in fact is that in order to succeed in the free enterprise system your best bet may be to undercut it america 's chief executives know this relatively few of them injected with high doses of truth serum would advocate an unfettered competitive marketplace the whole idea of which probably gives them nightmares what really matters is profit and most chief executives know that unfettered competition is rarely the best path to it freewheeling competition worst of all on price pales next to the riches associated with market domination consider echostar communications which is trying to acquire directv one satellite tv business is sure to be more profitable than two especially in rural areas where there is no cable alternative in this case the hand of government will be required to maintain a competitive marketplace and rupert murdoch the media mogul who covets directv for himself is lobbying accordingly since legal monopolies are hard to come by most executives prefer businesses with high barriers to entry government can help with this too by establishing costly and elaborate licensing requirements for example or by erecting barriers at the shoreline if you are in the steel business washington can shelter you from pesky imports that might force you to deliver better quality at lower prices if you are an airline chief executive your course is clear like all other experienced fund raisers you know that the best person to ask is someone who has given before that makes the federal government an obvious target certainly it 's a softer touch than the powerful unions representing well paid airline employees and getting more government largess is a lot better than cutting your own pay we are not asking for special treatment said leo f mullin chairman and chief executive of delta air lines he 's right businesses of all kinds asked for government help after 9 11 having been trained to do so by all the businesses already getting government help before the terrorist attacks what these companies mostly have in common is size airlines for instance are likelier to receive a handout than the waiters and cabdrivers thrown out of work in the travel downturn the government always seems to have money for farmers too but those wearing overalls need not apply most of the benefits go to agribusiness certainly there is no talk of a bailout for the nation 's ailing novelists despite the body blow we absorbed on that fateful day not only did it make most of us feel we were writing things that were trivial and stupid but it also hurt book sales i myself came out with a novel two weeks after 9 11 and despite favorable reviews it sank almost without a trace so far the bush administration has n't even delivered a starched hanky if i can scrape up the train fare to washington maybe we could siphon off just a little of that airline money to keep amtrak rolling i would appeal personally to congress and thanks to the airlines i can say in all seriousness that i 'm not asking for special treatment on the contrary daniel akst 's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first sunday of each month e mail culmoney nytimescom
 sri lankans turned out heavily today to vote in parliamentary elections that will serve as a referendum on the governing coalition 's strategy for ending the country 's 17 year war with separatist tamil rebels the race between the governing people 's alliance headed by president chandrika kumaratunga and the opposition united national party is expected to be very close mrs kumaratunga has pursued a carrot and stick approach to the ethnic conflict she tried to push through a new constitution that would have given tamils greater political autonomy but it was defeated in parliament by the opposition at the same time her government has spent more than 350 million in recent months on new military hardware for its war on the rebels who have refused offers to negotiate the opposition leader ranil wickremesinghe has said that he too favors a political solution to the ethnic conflict but he says the government must first have more extensive consultations with the country 's two most intransigent forces the liberation tigers of tamil eelam who have been fighting for a separate tamil homeland since 1983 and the sinhalese buddhist monks who have vociferously opposed any grant of autonomy to the tamils mrs kumaratunga leader of the sri lanka freedom party and mr wickremesinghe have clashed repeatedly although they are not very far apart on the ethnic question they have proved unable to work together the larger political issues were overshadowed today by charges of violence and vote rigging in parts of the country and by the death of sirimavo bandaranaike president kumaratunga 's mother who was the first woman to hold the post of prime minister mrs bandaranaike was a dominant figure in the country 's political life in the 1960 's and 70 's obituary page c31 an estimated 70 percent of the 12 million eligible voters in this island nation off the southern tip of india went to the polls today at the end of a violent election season they were choosing from a record 5477 candidates from 29 political parties and 99 other groups for 225 seats in the parliament fearing more thuggery the government imposed an 11 pm to 6 am curfew tonight sri lanka a country plagued for decades by political violence has seen more of it in recent weeks at least 60 people have died in suicide bomb attacks by tiger rebels as well as in incidents involving partisans of the major political parties the violence continued on election day the center for monitoring election violence an independent group said in a statement that voting in 210 of the country 's 9500 polling places had been so seriously compromised that the final outcome in these areas would be rendered utterly meaningless it cited incidents of vote rigging ballot box stuffing bombing intimidation and killings with the worst offenses in the center of the country mrs kumaratunga said in a statement today that she would support the election commissioner if he decides that the results of the voting in some areas should be set aside because of vote fraud she dispatched an elite commando unit to a central district after receiving reports of widespread violence there none of the possible outcomes of the voting today offer a strong hope for political consensus on the war which has claimed more than 60000 lives mrs kumaratunga 's alliance which had promised to bring peace six years ago had only a narrow majority in the last parliament after failing to deliver peace it seems unlikely to win a bigger majority this time and may well see its position erode it could still eke out a bare victory alternatively both main political forces could wind up without a majority forcing them to turn to smaller parties to seek a majority or the opposition could win outright if the governing party does not win one result might well be a worsening of the already discouraging political gridlock even with a hung parliament or the defeat of the governing alliance mrs kumaratunga who was re elected president last year will remain in office able to pick all the cabinet ministers and to chose whom from the opposition to call on to be prime minister this curious hybrid a cross between a presidential and a parliamentary system was set up in sri lanka 's 1978 constitution

 the bush administration today proposed dropping a requirement at the heart of federal rules that protect the privacy of medical records it said doctors and hospitals should not have to obtain consent from patients before using or disclosing medical information for the purpose of treatment or reimbursement the proposal favored by the health care industry was announced by tommy g thompson the secretary of health and human services who said the process of obtaining consent could have serious unintended consequences and could impair access to quality health care the sweeping privacy rules were issued by president bill clinton in december 2000 when mr bush allowed them to take effect last april consumer advocates cheered while much of the health care industry expressed dismay today 's proposal would repeal a provision widely viewed as the core of the clinton rules a requirement that doctors hospitals and other health care providers obtain written consent from patients before using or disclosing medical information for treatment the payment of claims or any of a long list of health care operations like setting insurance premiums and measuring the competence of doctors the proposal is to be published in the federal register next week with 30 days for public comment the government will consider the comments and then issue a final rule with the force of law secretary thompson said he wanted to remove the consent requirements because he believed they could delay care pharmacists and hospitals had expressed the same concern drugstores said they could not fill prescriptions phoned in by a doctor for pick up by a patient 's relative or neighbor hospitals said they could not schedule medical procedures until the patient had read a privacy notice and signed a consent form hospitals and insurance companies praised today 's proposal as a victory for common sense but consumer advocates and democratic members of congress denounced it as a threat to privacy in general this is great for the health care industry said elisabeth belmont corporate counsel for maine health which operates seven hospitals a nursing home and a home health agency in maine mary r grealy president of the health care leadership council which represents drug makers drugstores insurers and hospitals said the new proposal strikes an appropriate balance it 's a workable compromise but janlori goldman coordinator of the consumer coalition for health privacy an alliance of more than 100 groups favoring patients rights said the administration was proposing a destructive change representative edward j markey democrat of massachusetts said by stripping the consent requirement from the health privacy rule the bush administration strips patients of the fundamental right to give their consent before their health information is used or disclosed the administration 's proposal throws the baby away with the bath water senator edward m kennedy democrat of massachusetts said he was very concerned because he believed that an individual should have to give permission before medical information is disclosed the bush administration denied that it was eviscerating privacy protections the president believes strongly in the need for federal protections to ensure patient privacy and the changes we are proposing today will allow us to deliver strong protections for personal medical information while improving access to care mr thompson said under the rules doctors and other health care providers would still have to notify patients of their rights and the providers disclosure policies patients would be asked to acknowledge in writing that they had received such notice but could receive care without the acknowledgment ms goldman director of the health privacy project at georgetown university said it 's absurd to suggest that a notice serves the same purpose as consent signing the consent makes it more likely that people will understand their rights some parts of the clinton rules would survive the changes proposed by the bush administration patients would for example have a federal right to inspect and copy their records and could propose corrections congress could try to set privacy standards by law overriding decisions by the bush administration but that appears unlikely under a 1996 law congress instructed the secretary of health and human services to issue rules on medical privacy in the absence of action by congress and lawmakers have never been able to agree on standards in its proposal today the bush administration tries to ensure that parents have appropriate access to medical records of their children including information about mental health abortion and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse the clinton rules may have unintentionally limited parents access to their child 's medical records the bush administration said the proposal makes clear that state law governs disclosures to parents the bush proposal would also relax some consent requirements that medical researchers saw as particularly onerous the rules the first comprehensive federal standards for medical privacy affect virtually every doctor patient hospital pharmacy and health plan in the united states health care providers and insurers must comply by april 14 2003 anyone who violates the rules after that date will be subject to civil and criminal penalties including a 250000 fine and 10 years in prison for the most serious violations when mr clinton issued the rules in december 2000 he described them as the most sweeping privacy protections ever written mr bush took political credit for accepting those rules last april white house officials said mr bush would back a wide range of privacy protections for consumers even if he had to defy his usual business allies the white house wanted to avoid the political embarrassment mr bush suffered when he altered clinton policies on arsenic levels in drinking water global warming ergonomic rules and the contamination of school lunch meat with salmonella but after studying the medical privacy rules and listening to the concerns of companies in the health care industry the administration concluded that major provisions of the clinton rules were unworkable

 bosnia 's divided serbs croats and muslims voted for a new government today under western pressure to reject the nationalist parties that led this country into a brutal war in 1992 the international officials who have run bosnia as a virtual protectorate since the west forced a peace deal in 1995 are eager to scale back their presence here soon they are urging bosnians to vote for politicians committed to a multiethnic future who are deemed more capable of governing alone as a drip feed of more than 5 billion in foreign aid starts to dry up but two years to the day after the people of serbia toppled slobodan milosevic their ethnic kin in bosnia 's semiautonomous serb republic are expected to re elect a party founded by radovan karadzic their wartime leader who has been indicted on charges of genocide and is now on the run moderate parties stand a better chance in bosnia 's other half a federation of muslims and croats which also has a separate parliament in addition to the joint state assembly but the electoral prospects of these parties have been hit by the collapse of an unwieldy coalition that took power after the last general election in 2000 and by its failure to deliver social and economic improvements in one of europe 's poorest countries polls indicate that the biggest party in the departing government has nonetheless maintained its lead over more nationalist muslim and croat parties although if it is to regain power it will need support from several of the bewildering array of 57 parties on the ballot the big question in this election is whether it will be possible to form new non nationalist coalitions afterward said mark wheeler an analyst with the international crisis group a research group regardless of who wins sweeping constitutional changes imposed by the west will require all ethnic groups to share power at every level of bosnia 's multiple layers of government a legacy of the dayton peace accords which split the country down wartime front lines every elected office in the country bar those on municipal authorities is up for grabs today the first election that international officials have allowed bosnians to run for themselves since the war preliminary results are expected on monday but it could take weeks to learn who forms the next government the top jobs seats in bosnia 's three way joint presidency are likely to be taken by people with strong supporters and opponents serbs and croats some of whom still harbor hopes of joining their land to neighboring serbia and croatia are expected to elect nationalists the probable muslim winner haris silajdzic was prime minister during the war and is widely disliked by other groups for demanding the unification of bosnia 's two halves that prospect remains unthinkable at the moment but although bosnia remains dysfunctional the return of many refugees to their pre war homes has begun the sustainability of this progress after more than 200000 people were killed will depend not only on ordinary people but on whether the leaders they elect have vision to make bosnia a viable country for the first time since the guns fell silent officials will be elected for four years rather than two in the hope that they will knuckle down and jump start the economy but power in this country of 35 million people remains in the hands of a foreigner for now although paddy ashdown a british politician is likely to be the last international high representative here urging bosnians to eschew crooks and opportunists mr ashdown said the alternative was a country crippled by debt shunned by investors abandoned by the young undermined by corruption and condemned to a seemingly unending international oversight
 ahmad chalabi an iraqi opposition leader favored by the pentagon says he has raised with president bush 's envoy to iraq his concern that the united states appears ready to admit senior officials from saddam hussein 's baath party in a transitional government here the talks came amid reports of tension between mr chalabi and the american military here when mr chalabi tried earlier this week to enter a political meeting organized by american officials it took an hour to find the right door his press secretary zaab sethna said mr chalabi waited 45 minutes in a line to get in then left his aides said american soldiers stripped some of mr chalabi 's militia of their weapons the contradictory messages appear to be part of the difficulty the americans are having in bringing order to the political vacuum that has followed the ouster of mr hussein the situation is complicated by continuing uncertainty about whether mr hussein is alive and whether his top aides many of whom have eluded capture are capable of mounting organized opposition to the american presence jay garner the retired united states lieutenant general appointed to head the transition office here has met with some director generals from mr hussein 's ministries who by definition had to be members of the baath party he said at a news conference several days ago that membership in the baath party would not in itself disqualify iraqis from retaining their administrative jobs but that close associates of mr hussein and known violators of human rights would be barred francis brooke political adviser to mr chalabi 's organization the iraqi national congress said the inc 's policy is amnesty for everyone except the very worst he said that mr chalabi had himself met with the director generals of several ministries and what he called people from the apparatus of power and said that the goal should be to destroy institutions not individuals citing east germany and its secret police stasi as an example but mr chalabi said in an interview that he had raised his concern about admitting baath figures with zalmay khalilzad mr bush 's representative to the iraqi opposition in talks on tuesday mr chalabi declined to name names but other representatives of the iraqi national congress said that the central intelligence agency had retained saad janabi as a key adviser the opposition members identified mr janabi as a former assistant to hussein kamel mr hussein 's son in law who oversaw weapons programs defected to jordan in 1995 and was killed by mr hussein 's government when he later returned to iraq a cia spokesman in washington said he had no comment on whether mr janabi was advising the agency several iraqis who were baath party members said in interviews this week that the party was attempting to regroup in baghdad and elsewhere in the country one former official in mukhabarat the deposed government 's secret police described spying on international weapons inspectors while serving as a member of the national monitoring directorate the iraqi agency that accompanied inspectors on their visits about one fourth of the directorate 's roughly 475 people worked for the security police the official said requesting anonymity because of his fear of baathist reprisals an american military official said today he feared that the recent attacks on american soldiers in baghdad was the work of isolated members of the baath party kanan makiya a professor who supports mr chalabi 's group said that some 300 iraqis who attended a meeting of iraqi leaders on monday overwhelmingly endorsed american efforts to de baathify iraq he said that mr chalabi and the five other opposition leaders elected last february at a conference in northern iraq would meet on thursday to discuss plans for the provisional or transitional government that mr chalabi has long advocated and washington recently endorsed a broader conference of iraqis is to be held in about a month with a view to choosing an iraqi administration a timetable speeded up after a series of meetings in washington concluded that that was desirable bush administration officials have said however it appears that officials in washington have not resolved what position if any mr chalabi should occupy mr chalabi has strong support from deputy defense secretary paul d wolfowitz and from the office of vice president dick cheney however the state department and other american officials have reservations mr chalabi has his own united states military liaison officer col ted seel a special forces officer who reports to central command mr sethna said he said that checkpoints manned by mr chalabi 's militia the free iraqi fighters who have been trained in part under colonel seel were coordinated with the americans but mudhar shawkat the no 2 person in the iraqi national congress said an american military unit on monday stopped his two car convoy disarmed his guards made them lie in the street and called them looters and criminals some seven members of mr chalabi 's fighters have been injured in clashes with americans and leaders of the iraqi national congress are aware of the americans arrest on sunday of baghdad 's self appointed mayor muhammad al zubeidi mr brooke said he was glad that mr chalabi had been able to meet mr khalilzad to try to resolve the tensions mr chalabi the scion of an extremely wealthy and politically prominent shiite family left baghdad in 1958 and returned this month he was in northern iraq for several years operating the major opposition group from the persian gulf war of 1991 until 1996 he has set up headquarters in the hunting club in the exclusive mansur district with his free iraqi fighters opposite in another club guarded by american humvees his wealth and his evident american backing have attracted a bevy of visitors from all walks of life but the level of his popular support or even recognition remains unclear in a society still largely without electricity radio television or newspapers

 realnetworks plans to release software today that it hopes will convince media companies to distribute their vast libraries of music movies and books over the internet and enable realnetworks to capture a portion of the hundreds of billions of dollars consumers are expected to spend on such products robert d glaser chief executive of realnetworks is scheduled to demonstrate the software known as real system media commerce suite at a conference in long beach calif he also plans to propose a standard language that would allow media companies to integrate software like that of realnetworks into their existing databases more easily the new software is one of several products that aim to ensure both that what media companies sell online can not be redistributed free by whoever buys it and that media companies can accurately track the rights of artists who expect to be compensated for online sales but such software known as digital rights management also promises to radically change the experience of consuming various kinds of culture with realnetworks software for instance media companies can allow consumers to buy a movie for two days or five viewings or three viewings over the course of a month all for different prices besides persuading media companies to adopt such systems the other obstacle is getting consumers to download the software necessary to make the systems work the realnetworks software will be distributed when users download or upgrade the company 's real player software used to play video or music on personal computers and other devices about 15 million of the 250 million real players currently in use include the rights management software mr glaser 's announcement also signals the intensification of the rivalry between realnetworks and microsoft both of which would like to control the way consumers experience media in the digital realm microsoft has distributed 350 million copies of its own rights management software in new versions of its windows operating system and its windows media player the company said 85 million transactions had been completed with its software so far the bulk of which were promotional music releases but unlike realnetworks which plans to ask media companies for a small percentage of the transactions they perform with its software microsoft plans to simply charge for its software in this industry its very difficult right now for media companies to make money from streaming media said will poole vice president of the windows digital media division at microsoft for real to insert themselves in the middle of that will be challenging mr poole also criticized mr glaser 's proposal of a standard for setting the rules that govern the choices companies can offer consumers noting that a different standard had already been proposed and is supported by several software companies including microsoft steve frison president of centerspan which distributes music and video on its scour site using microsoft 's rights management technology said that he suspected many media companies would end up using both systems and maybe others like those offered by ibm or intertrust technologies

 with new york facing a gigantic budget shortfall and the economy still staggering the percentage of voters who approve of how gov george e pataki is handling his job has fallen to the lowest level in seven years according to a statewide poll by quinnipiac university the poll taken from feb 4 to feb 10 found that 49 percent of the registered voters surveyed approved of mr pataki 's job performance and 41 percent disapproved the other 10 percent had no opinion in late september just before the republican governor won a third term the same polling institute showed his approval rating was 62 percent maurice carroll the director of the polling institute said voters appeared to be responding in large part to mr pataki 's budget proposal which would close an 115 billion gap mostly by cutting back spending on education and health care throughout the election the governor successfully avoided answering questions about the shaky state of the state 's budget and only revealed the size of the looming deficit in january lisa stoll a spokeswoman for the governor said it was natural for the voters to respond negatively to the bearer of bad news ms stoll said however that the poll also shows mr pataki 's underlying strength 62 percent of the voters surveyed think mr pataki has good leadership qualities and 59 percent think he is honest and trustworthy according to the poll new yorkers know the governor is a strong leader and trust he will make the tough choices necessary to grow our economy ms stoll said mr pataki 's stature among voters has not sunk this low since july 1996 when the quinnipiac poll showed about 46 percent of voters approved of his job performance during a bitter budget fight he peaked at 81 percent in october 2001 when asked if they would prefer raising taxes in order to keep state services at their current level or cut services to keep taxes stable 47 percent of the people who responded to the survey sided with the governor 's approach of cutting services but 41 percent said they would prefer higher taxes the rest were undecided but 84 percent of those surveyed disagreed with the governor 's proposed cuts to health care for the poor the polling institute at the college in hamden conn surveyed 1141 randomly chosen registered votes across the state the margin of sampling error for a sample of this size is plus or minus 3 percentage points so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant
 the congressional budget office predicted today that the federal government would run big budget deficits through 2005 and those estimates do not include the impact of president bush 's proposals for higher military spending and his ideas for additional tax cuts the bipartisan office also estimated that tax revenues this year are about 131 billion or 66 percent lower than last year the biggest one year drop in nearly half a century the forecast is considerably more pessimistic than what the bush administration has predicted and it virtually wipes out the trillion dollar surpluses that the white house and the congress had foreseen over the next decade the new estimates point to a sharp reversal in the government 's fiscal position which shifted from a sizeable overall surplus last year to an even bigger overall deficit this year they were immediately seized as fodder by democrats and republicans alike in the battle over extending the tax cuts that mr bush pushed through congress last year democrats said mr bush 's tax cuts were the main culprit behind the abrupt lurch into the red and they used today 's report to attack the president 's plan to make those tax cuts permanent the president is taking us down the path of soaring budget deficits and he wants to dig the hole even deeper said senator kent conrad democrat of north dakota and chairman of the senate budget committee but white house officials and congressional republicans argued that the new deficits merely reflected the recent economic slowdown the price of the war in afghanistan and the costs of beefing up domestic security against terrorism dan l crippen the director of the budget office said the recession and the plunging stock markets appeared to have played a bigger role than the tax cuts in reducing tax revenues but mr crippen also said that the magnitude of the drop remained somewhat of a mystery tax revenues have declined faster than the economy itself and nobody knows why much of it may stem from huge stock market losses but it may also reflect deeper changes in tax paying behavior that endure beyond today 's bear market by law the congressional budget office can not base its estimates on proposals by the white house or congress it assumes that the tax laws remain unchanged and that spending continues on the same trend over the next 10 years inevitably the forecasts diverge with reality as both the laws and the nation 's economy evolve perhaps the most striking trend in the latest forecast is the long string of deficits that would occur under almost any situation when excluding the off budget surpluses accumulating in the social security trust funds which are supposed to be reserved for the baby boom generation 's retirement the new forecast estimates that the deficit will stretch until 2010 and be followed by small surpluses in the next two years but even those modest surpluses assume that mr bush 's tax cuts last year expire in 2010 as scheduled the president is pushing hard for congress to make them permanent if he is successful then tax revenues would decline by an additional 350 billion in 2011 and 2012 and even the modest non social security budget surpluses in 2011 and 2012 would evaporate the other element not included in today 's forecast are mr bush 's ideas for some incremental tax cuts next year as well as large additional spending increases for the military and domestic security republican analysts on the senate budget committee said the combined impact of those changes would increase next year 's total budget deficit to 180 billion all of that adds up to considerably higher deficits over the next several years than the white house office of management and budget predicted in july at that time the administration said the total deficit would shrink to 71 billion next year and disappear in 2004 in a historical perspective the bickering about deficits over the next year or two is probably less important than the much longer term outlook even the pessimistic plans envision a federal deficit that would be less than 2 percent of the american gross domestic product and would decline over the next few years
 in the final weeks of last year 's governor 's race and the heady days immediately following his landslide victory at the polls james e mcgreevey made a sweeping promise to new jersey residents that he would not raise taxes less than three months into his term however mr mcgreevey is struggling to close a steep budget deficit and his administration has been steadily trying to prepare the public for an increase in the cigarette tax and changes in the corporate business tax which will bring an additional 700 million to state coffers mr mcgreevey is not scheduled to outline his budget plan until he addresses the state legislature on tuesday but as details of the plan have begun to emerge elected officials from both parties are eagerly awaiting the public reaction to the governor 's likely reversal on taxes even mr mcgreevey 's critics concede that he has been remarkably disciplined in reminding the public that he inherited the deficit from the republicans who controlled trenton for the past decade and in arguing that they should bear much of the responsibility for the painful moves to come he has also tried to create some political wiggle room for himself since taking office by refining his no tax pledge and saying that he was only referring to the sales and income taxes but no elected official in trenton has forgotten that in 1990 gov jim florio 's 28 billion tax increase cost democrats the governor 's mansion and control of both houses of the legislature especially not mr mcgreevey at a press conference in the state house last week the governor was asked whether his shifting position on tax increases was similar to mr florio 's mr mcgreevey used some of his most forceful language to date to describe the problem he now confronts during the course of the campaign i clearly stated it was my objective not to raise taxes he said thumping on the lectern to emphasize his words then upon seeing that literally this represents the largest deficit not only in the history of the state of new jersey this is the largest deficit of any state government in the history of the united states of america this is the all time record breaker one quarter of budget mr mcgreevey based that claim on projections that new jersey will have a deficit equal to 25 percent of its total budget no state has ever had a deficit as high on a percentage basis but republicans who have bristled at the governor 's repeated criticism accuse mr mcgreevey of overstating the problem in order to lower expectations and allow himself to magnify his accomplishments once a balanced budget is finally adopted the governor 's office has projected a 6 billion shortfall last year 's budget was 23 billion there can be no shortfall before a budget has been presented to us said state senator leonard lance a republican from hunterdon i do n't see how you can blame the whitman administration or prior legislatures for a budget that has yet to be written the chief culprit in the state 's budget problems was the economy which brought a sharp drop in tax revenues during the past year mr mcgreevey has already taken steps to close the 3 billion shortfall in the fiscal year ending june 30 by laying off 600 state workers enacting a 5 percent across the board cut and tapping into surpluses in an assortment of special funds now he must propose a budget at a time when income tax receipts are still down and automatic increases in state spending are likely to exceed projected revenues by 5 billion or more the size of that gap in a budget that will likely approach 24 billion has forced mr mcgreevey to consider a handful of steps that he had hoped to avoid he said the state work force would likely be reduced by an early retirement program and more layoffs might be needed eventually despite his relentless complaints that republicans borrowed money irresponsibly during the past decade mr mcgreevey is considering a plan to raise 15 billion by issuing bonds against the state 's proceeds from the tobacco settlement but the most provocative parts of the program are the governor 's two proposals to adjust the state tax code in a reversal from two months ago the governor said this week that he has not ruled out a 50 cent per pack increase in the cigarette tax which would raise 200 million per year he is also likely to adjust the corporate business tax by closing loopholes that allow some major companies to pay as little as 200 per year in state taxes those changes could bring in an additional 500 million in tax revenues the plan now being weighed by the governor does not call for an increase in the corporate tax rate i think people have the reasonable expectation to have fairness and equity mr mcgreevey said noting that the average new jersey family pays more than 200 in state taxes but republicans have already branded the plan a tax increase and warn that it might prolong the economic downturn by forcing companies to leave the state and costing workers their jobs new jersey has learned the hard way that tax hikes cost jobs especially when they 're aimed at our state 's largest employers said senator joseph kyrillos of middletown in fact the last time our businesses faced a significant tax increase over 200000 new jerseyeans lost their jobs recent public opinion polls show that most new jersey residents are not deeply opposed to higher corporate taxes but they already pay some of the highest property tax rates in the country so some political analysts warn that if the governor cuts the property tax rebate program or if his reduction in aid to school districts and local governments leads to property tax increases mr mcgreevey could face political consequences if he does n't raise the sales or income tax i think he can finesse his way through this said david rebovich a political science professor at rider university but there 's a second whammy in this budget crisis how long will school district officials wait to say to their own constituents that they have to raise property taxes because their aid has been frozen by jim mcgreevey

 two years ago when america online the cheeky internet powerhouse announced that it was buying time warner the paragon of offline publishing and entertainment it was seen as confirmation that new media had officially overpowered the old then the internet boom imploded and conventional wisdom celebrated the return of established media firms to dominating the consumption of culture both views are out of date what is evolving is neither new media nor old but a complicated creature that has media companies searching for ways to fuse elements of both into a single and profitable hybrid the success of the new management team announced yesterday at aol time warner analysts said may depend on its crossbreeding skills the new media paradigm is gone said tom wolzien a senior media analyst at sanford c bernstein what you have is the old idea that where people are spending time is an opportunity to sell to them but they are spending time in new places the plunge in share prices of internet media stars like yahoo and aol may belie the continuing impact of the internet in america 's media habits in part that impact may be disguised by the continuing downturn in the economy which has both new and old media struggling to find advertisers who want to sell to their audiences but last week a report by the center for communication policy at the university of california at los angeles said that television watching was down by 4 1 2 hours a week among americans who used the internet compared with those who did not it has been clear for a while that the internet is not going to single handedly overturn older media and that there are huge audiences for conventional media properties like harry potter and the new britney spears album the trick for media companies is how to make their new and old media divisions act like more than the sum of their parts and it is one that all of them are trying to perform with less than complete success for things like sports and music that live really well online and on television i think it 's crazy not to integrate it said judy mcgrath president of mtv i do n't think it 's one or the other i think it 's a new kind of synthesis the main old new fusion project at mtv which is owned by viacom is called mtv360 which schedules programming to its viewers across its cable channels and its web site directing them from one location to another the program is based on research indicating that the young viewers who watch mtv are watching television at the same time they are communicating on the internet that kind of cross promotion was one of the driving ideas behind aol and time warner 's merger in addition the presumption was that aol 's subscriber base would continue to grow as it has aol 's 32 million subscribers spend an average of 70 minutes online a day during prime time aol attracts about 32 million simultaneous users almost twice that of any cable network the idea was that companies who are in the places where people are migrating as well as where they already are stand a better chance of surviving cbs is often cited as an example of a media company that lost an important audience by failing to move to cable fast enough the splintering of media platforms has companies scrambling to deliver entertainment and information on television radio the internet video game platforms wireless hand held devices and cellphones i do n't think anything takes over anything else said robert w pittman the former chief executive of aol who became the sole chief operating officer of aol time warner yesterday what happens is the lines get very very blurry mr pittman said the company saw an opportunity to increase the amount the average household spends on aol service from 20 per month to 150 by offering old media products like magazine subscriptions and other information and services through its new media outlets he said it might be possible to coax 200 per month out of each home that now subscribes to its cable service for 60 per month by selling other aol time warner products although company executives acknowledge privately that it may have taken longer than they wished aol time warner made its first major foray into cross promotions with the release last month of the harry potter movie which was heavily promoted on aol in advertising information features and chat room sessions other efforts to mix old media and new include a service that allows aol users to watch the latest edition of cnn headline news from the top no matter how many minutes of the hour are gone when they double click on their computer icons one of the goals of the merger was that we would operate as one mr pittman added that 's what we 've been doing and intend to keep doing the degree to which aol really did take over time warner may be more evident in the company 's culture than in its products some media executives said time warner was known for a decentralized structure in which the executives at its individual units had great autonomy now the chief executives at its operating units meet every other week with senior corporate management at least from a cost perspective it seems like it 's the aol culture that 's driving it said frank biondi a former viacom chief executive who is senior managing director at waterview advisors an investment advising company they 've been in there cutting costs taking higher priced cash people and changing them to stock and compensation that cultural shift may spread to other media firms as well but the need for central control may be greater at aol because it is so big in terms of market capitalization the company is twice the size of viacom four times the size of disney and nine times the size of gannett according to mr wolzien of sanford c bernstein own it all mr wolzien said that 's the new paradigm according to aol
 here 's a conversational icebreaker for those interminable hours that you may be spending in airport lounges as this summer of endless flight delays grinds on did you know that 10 bolivian bolivianos got you 34 bulgarian levs at the money changing counters yesterday how about that cyprus pound one for 162 or that indonesian rupiah 9100 for 1 today this sort of detailed foreign exchange information which i guarantee will instantly trump any unwelcome lounge colloquies on the mind numbing subject of someone else 's frequent flier miles used to be somewhat inconvenient to obtain with any precision and convenience but smart international business travelers have recently been discovering a web site that offers current foreign exchange data in exhaustive detail it 's wwwoandacom extensively revamped last spring by the oanda corporation an internet company that was spun off four years ago by olsen associates the swiss econometrics firm oandacom 's most useful feature is called the fx for foreign exchange cheat sheet which allows a user to find a current exchange rate by clicking on one currency and comparing it with any of 173 other world currencies the chart can be printed out you also can instantly find out what the historical exchange rates have been for any of those currencies growing numbers of business people are making multi destination international trips when they come home they confront the headaches of filing an expense account that needs to figure say how much that 400000 lira a night hotel room in milan actually cost answer 194 yesterday 187 just 60 days ago being a business traveler it was always kind of a nightmare to figure out the exchange rates especially if you did n't do your expenses right away said timothy kelly oanda 's chief executive you 'd be 'what the heck was the rate two weeks ago or a month ago when i had a thousand dollars of expenses in milan and some more in frankfurt paris and london it could get a little hairy hairy even for the beetle brows in the accounting department by the way those fluctuations can total 10 or 20 percent during an extended trip abroad he said on extended trips abroad a 10 percent differential can add up to real money it 's a matter of not shortchanging yourself and not overcharging your company oanda said that its currency converter technology was licensed by 13000 clients many of whom use it on their own web sites among them are travel and airline sites and even retail merchants who can rig their online catalogs with oanda 's software to instantly display prices in various currencies incidentally i am one of those travelers for whom even the simplest permutations of foreign exchange remain invincibly unfathomable in a long conversation the other day mr kelly managed to keep my attention when he told me that oanda is about to join up with thomas cook ltd the travel and foreign exchange services company to offer an online service for ordering foreign cash and having it sent quickly to your home this way you can have a modest stash of local currency in your pocket when you hit the foreign airport some banks and travel service companies already offer similar foreign cash delivery but the oanda site had 25 million hits in june and has about four million users according to webtrends an internet traffic measurement concern that 's a lot of potential customers who might be persuaded to push a little button and order cash mr kelly suggested is n't it dangerous to send cash through the mail i asked him nothing that would dissuade us from doing this business mr kelly replied he said that the cash would be sent either by priority mail or for an extra charge by express or overnight shipping in envelopes that do n't advertise the fact that they contain loot the outer envelope is of course the generic delivery service envelope he said it does n't have a big emblazoned logo like oanda the currency site which would basically be a steal me sticker having thus reassured me on a simple financial point mr kelly began to outline oanda 's ambitious plans to one day soon become an online trading interface for individuals and a business to business exchange service linking importers and exporters and others within three to six months time we will be a fully integrated fx trading hub he said adding that oanda 's online penetration traction and velocity will aid in the establishment of a new electronic marketplace for foreign exchange obviously there are people including some reporters who can fathom the implications of this me i was listening politely and taking notes while at the same time fiddling on my computer with the oanda web site i can report that it has many entertaining travel features besides those currency conversion charts for example you can click on temperature and convert fahrenheit to celsius and vice versa another chart has shoe size comparisons american british and continental men 's and women 's another has those old

 nicholas e calio 's chauffeur driven black chrysler was pulling into the white house gates last week back from mr calio 's third trip that day to capitol hill where the bush administration 's proposed trade bill had run into trouble trade bills are notoriously difficult said mr calio the very wired white house congressional liaison whose job is to round up the votes to turn one of president bush 's top legislative priorities into law so he hates trade bills i love them mr calio responded because they 're fun everything 's a problem last week as the white house fought back a storm of criticism that it had missed clues to the sept 11 attacks another battle was under way on capitol hill mr bush 's bill giving the president the right to make trade deals that congress ca n't revise once called fast track now trade promotion authority came under daily assault the legislation had squeaked through the republican controlled house in december and the trend in the democratic controlled senate which was not in the mood to do the president any favors did not bode well by thursday so many senators had offered so many amendments that the white house lost track then it was forced to devote its energies to defeating what it considered the poison pill amendments that would turn off so many senators that the bill could go down mr calio 49 was the man at the center nick how do you want to do this senator trent lott of mississippi the republican leader said in a morning strategy session in mr lott 's office the problem was how to persuade key senators to defeat three amendments among them one that would provide health coverage to retired steelworkers who lose their benefits because of bankruptcies caused by foreign competition that proposal infuriated republicans still mad over a concession on health benefits they had already made to the democrats mr calio his reading glasses down on his nose his white cuffs with the nec monogram exposed like a lobbyist 's tattoo was ready his old job was as a lobbyist my suggestion would be that we split it up between ourselves and the cabinet secretaries and that would double hit people he told mr lott meaning that senators would be lobbied twice mr lott nodded then asked now what democrats are we going to get mr calio whipped out a sheet of names we 've got an extensive list of targets he replied a short time later mr calio was in his war room the vice president 's office in a corner of the capitol sending out staff members with lists of senators to lobby at the same time he was on the phone to mr lott alarmed about a republican who had said the trade bill could wait until next year that 's outrageous mr calio said he seemed stressed out exhausted and happy it 's the best job in the world mr calio said you are right in the middle of everything all the time there are a lot of problems and even on the days when it 's all washing over you and people are screaming at you about one thing or another it 's still fun in its own odd way you have to enjoy that mr calio who had the same but less busy job in the administration of bush i said the president sometimes called five times a day to check on legislation i know the media loves to think he is n't engaged mr calio said the guy knows every single issue he follows what goes on on the hill very closely on thursday mr calio had the president meet in mr lott 's office with five republican senators from steel producing states george v voinovich and mike dewine of ohio arlen specter and rick santorum of pennsylvania and jeff sessions of alabama he wanted to remind them that he had recently helped them out by imposing 30 percent tariffs on foreign steel imports and now he needed their help to defeat the steelworkers amendment it was forceful pressure reminding them that sometimes you give and sometimes you get mr calio said mr calio who said his biggest legislative victory was the bush tax cut and his biggest defeat was the senate rejection of oil drilling in alaska lives with his wife and three children in chevy chase md he collects wine sleeps three to four hours a night and has a sense of humor that evidently amuses the president on a day when mr bush gave a speech at the white house about cloning mr calio persuaded andrew h card jr the white house chief of staff to join him in wearing a george w bush mask into the oval office hey mr president how did the cloning event go mr calio asked as he and mr card strolled in
 the politicians and propagandists who wage our war on drugs have really outdone themselves after bloating the prisons and creating a vast antidrug industrial complex they have now bribed our networks to deliver prime time audiences for indoctrination and even corralled many newspapers as do good collaborators not even during the cold war with our faith in democracy at stake did federal authorities dare so to subsidize and subvert our media back then congress explicitly forbade the agencies promoting anti communism notably the united states information agency its voice of america and even the central intelligence agency to aim their propaganda at americans why because everyone understood that the government 's heavy hand on the scale of public opinion could distort the weight of any argument and diminish the public 's freedom that principle seems in urgent need of reinforcement for it has been shown that the bait of a few million dollars was all it took to get our once fiercely independent broadcasters to submit to government tutelage and to lure many papers including the times into taking government rewards for what appeared to be independent public service the furtive broadcast scheme was discovered by daniel forbes a writer for saloncom the internet magazine and covered with due concern by a few newspapers in response president clinton and the television industry made light of their collusion and disclosed the lesser involvement of their newspaper critics just a bit of chummy cooperation in a good cause they argued when their two years of secret dealing became known the times for its part explained that it was rendering only advertising and circulation services without affecting its news coverage or content i would like to believe that the broadcasters collaboration though deplorable had nothing to do with government 's recent gifts to them of spectrum space worth about 70billion and of regulations permitting unprecedented concentrations of station ownership and i know the newspapers think they merit praise not blame for disseminating socially useful messages but it is odd that an industry usually quick to wrap itself in the first amendment would so readily invite the government to read and influence the content of tv programs and accept government rewards for community service this sad bending of principle began in 1997 when gen barry r mccaffrey who heads the office of national drug control policy at the white house was authorized by congress to spend up to 1 billion over five years to buy television time and newspaper ads to agitate against drug use to take the curse off this media subsidy congress insisted on paying only half price for every ad purchased it wanted another run free of charge but when a booming economy made commercial time scarce and expensive the networks longed for relief from their commitment to discounts so they were told they could meet their obligation by another route rather than matching the government 's paid ads one for one the broadcasters were invited to plant antidrug messages in their prime time dramas and sitcoms and newspapers were allowed to exchange ad space for things like teaching guides and pamphlets in the case of the times pamphlets were distributed with a sales pitch for school subscriptions in belatedly hinting at all these deals at a little noticed congressional hearing last fall general mccaffrey never let on that his office had been turned into a full blown script review board it decided which tv stories and newspaper programs were on message and on strategy which needed guidance and improvement and how much relief from matching ad time or space each message and activity was worth without apparent hesitation the networks showered the white house with scripts and tapes that could qualify for reward including even unfinished scripts that could still be altered though their producers and writers were never told of the practice almost all major shows were at some time offered for credit the simpsons ally mcbeal law and order the drew carey show beverly hills 90210 cosby home improvement and many more a show that portrayed parents confronting a joint smoking child in ways the white house deemed effective could redeem the equivalent of two or three 30 second ads worth at least 100000 an even larger amount might be earned by showing a youth resisting peer pressure to take up cocaine and if a whole story line were judged helpful well then shows like er or the practice to offer just two examples recouped commercial time worth a million dollars or more some network executives accepted the government 's guidance to reshape a script some badgered unsuspecting writers to insert antidrug messages into their plots one producer john tinker recalls being urged to rush ahead with an antidrug script of chicago hope even though it had been kicking around unappreciated for years several hundred newspapers and their web sites also took in white house ads and matched them in different ways besides running a free ad for every paid one the times won credits for its schools pamphlets which the white house checked simply for accuracy the best proof that the arrangement was dangerously misguided is that it was long treated as secret when the story broke abc announced that it had stopped participating after the government had asked it to submit all scripts in advance calling this a misconception the white house promised to end all previews and to settle for post broadcast reviews this may dispel the odor of censorship but it leaves in place the payments of government payola for propaganda if that represents high minded media service why stop with antidrug scenarios why not pay the media for shielding young minds from sex and gunplay and one day soon depending on which party controls the government purse why not subsidize scripts and ads that sanction or discourage abortion president clinton artfully distinguished the antidrug payola from any effort to regulate content and general mccaffrey 's spokesman said we do not clear scripts our objective is to provide a better understanding of the drug issue a much better use of public money would be to re educate all concerned in the values of first amendment independence our public officials obviously need reminding that they belong in front of the camera not behind it and our media executives should have learned long ago that those who feed at government honeypots inevitably get stuck correction march 19 2000 sunday the word image column on feb 6 referred incorrectly to the white house 's monitoring of television scripts for financial credits to broadcasters although the monitoring was not widely reported it was not treated as a government secret

 a few weeks ago i went shopping for a 32 inch television set i visited a couple of local electronics superstores read consumer reports talked to friends and i searched the internet where i found just the highly rated feature laden model i wanted for 750 shipping included no tax the salesman at circuit city was willing to match the price but with the sales tax it would still cost me more so i bought the tv set from an e commerce site called 800com it arrived recently and works perfectly this was a great deal for me and by making it i participated in a grand experiment that is helping to hold down inflation while sustaining the booming economy too bad it ca n't last let me explain there are several big reasons why the american economy has managed in recent years to defy the rule of thumb that strong growth and low unemployment inevitably lead the general level of prices up an accelerating escalator perhaps the most crucial factor lately has been fierce competition from internet shopping sites willing to sell goods at a loss in order to lure customers from traditional retailers while comparatively few people actually buy much yet online the cut rate prices widely available in the virtual economy have forced many companies operating in the bricks and mortar world to respond by keeping their prices low too as sung won sohn chief economist at wells fargo bank in minneapolis recently noted in just one example among many many people check toy prices on the internet and ask toy stores to match them or they see the merchandise at a store and go home and buy it for less on the internet this is heaven for consumers while the general price level for all goods and services has been rising for the last few years at what is still a very modest 2 percent or so prices in many of the most competitive arenas are actually down the price index for toys as calculated by the bureau of labor statistics has been falling since 1995 books on average cost less today than in 1997 prices for audio and video equipment which just joined the e commerce rush dipped last year by 038 percent but it is hell for retailers despite the benefit of a sales tax exemption e commerce companies selling everything from harry potter and pokemon to dvd players and the saving private ryan disks to watch on them all at big discounts are losing tons of money some say they are inherently more efficient and it is just a matter of time before they turn a profit others like buycom argue that they do n't need to make money on products they sell to consumers because they expect to make plenty selling ad space on their sites either way merchants on the web do n't really care as long as investors remain willing to bid up their stock making it easy to raise even more cash to cover their losses this situation is bound to come to an end it wo n't happen immediately but even internet companies can not continue to lose money indefinitely there 's going to be a shakeout said jose a rasco an economist at hoenig company in rye brook ny who wrote a short report last week on what he calls digital deflation i 'm not a big believer in the model that says you can sell at a loss but make it up on volume mr rasco added and ad spending wo n't hold up in a downturn so when the consolidation takes place and it will suppliers will regain some pricing leverage over consumers none of this diminishes the extraordinary economic benefits to be derived from the commercialization of the internet even after many of the web sites that can not generate a profit disappear the internet will remain a powerful tool for bringing together potential buyers and sellers from anywhere in the world the web will continue to empower consumers by giving them a lot more information to use in bargaining for the best price cars for example are not sold online but sites like autobytel wwwautobytelcom and carpoint wwwcarpointcom allow buyers to solicit bids from a number of dealers from the haven of their own desks and there is now a wealth of once secret wholesale price information available online i remember when the edmunds blue book was practically the holy grail mr rasco said now you can get it everywhere online for free this free for all has forced every supplier that wants to survive to become more efficient enhancing economic growth in myriad ways and consumers taking advantage of their savings have more money left to spend freely on all kinds of things but the current arrangement in which many web shopping sites are practically giving away their products is too good to last enjoy it while you can

 mayor michael r bloomberg and gov george e pataki are suddenly at odds over tens of millions of dollars in homeland defense money that congress is poised to approve with each man lobbying at the other 's expense in washington for a larger share of the aid the dueling messages from albany and city hall come at an extremely sensitive time with leaders on capitol hill working out the final details on how to best allocate as much as 1 billion in federal aid to help the most vulnerable states and localities defend themselves against terrorist attacks lawmakers in both parties said the governor 's aides were furiously working the phones yesterday trying to change a formula that gives new york city 80 percent of any money that will be doled out to new york state the governor believes the state should have a larger share mr bloomberg meanwhile was pressing lawmakers to preserve that very same formula one that his aides and other lawmakers insist he helped create through his persistence and persuasive lobbying in washington in recent weeks the aides said bloomberg administration officials were astounded at mr pataki 's move all of the legislators we talked to in washington were sympathetic about giving at least 80 percent to the city said a senior new york city police official we are very very angry about this attempt to shift money away from where the threat is mayor bloomberg has ostentatiously declined to criticize mr pataki even as the governor has refused the mayor 's request for more state aid blocked the city 's plan to impose a commuter tax and proposed a budget that would cut millions a year to schools and health care programs even when pressed by other city and legislative leaders mr bloomberg has maintained that he would rather quietly negotiate with the governor whom he strongly supported in the last election than pick public fights and cause a political commotion honey is his favorite analogy for his methodology but with both the city and state facing huge deficits and dismal revenue projections the two republicans are at loggerheads over this expected pot of federal money aides to the mayor said mr bloomberg called mr pataki after his successful trip to washington to relay the good news but the governor immediately began complaining about the 80 20 split people close to mr pataki confirmed that the governor was upset about the formula the rift between the city and state has opened at a critical moment on tuesday the house appropriations committee approved a bill that would give 700 million to localities considered to be at high risk of a terror attack a similar spending bill is being hammered out in the senate though democrats have raised the stakes by seeking a little more than 1 billion for high risk localities both houses are expected to pass a bill perhaps within the week that would allocate the money tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to places like new york city and washington which are considered at high risk of another attack and are taking extensive steps to protect themselves the high risk money is on top of at least 15 billion that congress is expected to divide among the states based on population the house measure gained momentum after furious lobbying efforts by mr bloomberg who persuaded both democrats and republicans that new york is a special case and has incurred great expense   in the midst of the worst fiscal crisis in a generation to protect itself against future attacks but mr pataki is arguing that the state is also spending an inordinate amount to protect itself and that most of its expenses are incurred in bolstering the city in the midst of its own desperate financial situation with an 115 billion deficit new york state is spending 75 million a week on security measures the governor 's aides said state officials said the state is spending 25 million a week for increased patrols in subways grand central terminal penn station and other transit hubs 2 million a week for increased port authority patrols in new york city particularly at the airports 21 million a week for an increased state police and national guard presence at power plants transit hubs and new york city reservoirs across the state a lot of the state 's costs are being incurred by the port authority and the mta said one pataki official yesterday mr pataki 's administration was lobbying aides to tom ridge the secretary of homeland security and leaders on capitol hill to have the formula changed so that the state would be eligible for more than 20 percent at the very least the governor 's allies argued the funds should be disbursed at the discretion of mr ridge who in turn could decide where the genuine need is we do n't think 20 percent would be adequate said one person close to the governor the governor 's actions have left the bloomberg administration seething switching to that formula does not bear any relationship to where the threat is said a senior new york city police official he said every briefing indicates that new york city is a target of terrorists and it is not the state that is carrying the bulk of the protection load we are very unhappy the police official said told of the city 's unhappiness lisa dewald stoll a spokeswoman for the governor said the governor continues to work with mayor bloomberg to advocate on behalf of both the city and the state to insure that there are adequate funds to protect the people of new york city the surrounding areas and communities throughout the state meanwhile the governor was facing a greater hurdle in the senate where his aides said democrats were proposing a formula that could cut states out entirely and give all of the 1 billion pot they were proposing in homeland security funding to localities mr pataki himself called new york 's senior senator charles e schumer a democrat today expressing his concerns some congressional representatives said they were sympathetic to mr bloomberg who was summoned to washington from the opening day baseball game at shea stadium on monday by congressman john e sweeney to make his case to key members of the committee i think the mayor was strongly influential in getting this done mr sweeney said yesterday today the full house is expected to vote on the appropriations bill and several members of the new york delegation predicted that the state to city ratio would remain as written i would suspect that someone may come to the floor with an amendment to reconfigure the formula said mr sweeney but i do n't expect that they will be very successful
 as the red ink flows in a somewhat hidden manner the nasdaq 100 is setting new standards for a price earnings ratio by a major index the index is now trading at 811 times the combined earnings of the companies in the index the surge in the price earnings ratio means stocks in the nasdaq 100 are now exceptionally expensive on the basis of the companies ability to actually make money the ratio which had never been above 165 before this year reflects the fact that many nasdaq companies are reporting huge losses for 2000 when their financial results are analyzed using generally accepted accounting principles known as gaap that trend has been obscured however because many companies adjust the numbers in ways that make profits appear to be rising the disparity between the pro forma headlines that companies emphasize in their news releases and the gaap numbers has grown enormously over the past month and a half said thomas coleman the head of research and risk management for aequilibrium investments a london based money management firm the price earnings ratio is based on the earnings or losses of each company in the index for the most recently reported 12 months those numbers are weighted according to the relative weight of each company in the index which includes 100 of the largest companies traded on the nasdaq market the rapid rise in the price earnings ratio which stood at 127 at the end of december does not reflect any significant change in the price of the stocks in the index since the end of the year the nasdaq 100 stock index ended last week at 226177 down 34 percent for 2001 it is down 519 percent since it peaked in march when the price earnings ratio was 165 a fraction of the current ratio had earnings stayed the same the price earnings ratio would be less than half the 165 level instead the soaring price earnings ratio reflects big losses being posted for the fourth quarter of last year by a number of companies in contrast to profits or much smaller losses for the same quarter of 1999 overall profits of the companies in the index are down 90 percent since the index peaked the nosedive in profits is tied to write offs the largest of which appears to come from excite home the cable internet company which took a 46 billion hit other nasdaq 100 companies that took large write offs included amazoncom yahoo and cnet most nasdaq 100 companies have persuaded analysts to make their estimates on earnings numbers that exclude certain costs although the excluded costs vary from company to company most of the big losses being reported this year are in the areas that are not included in the pro forma or adjusted earnings that the companies want investors to focus on in some cases those losses may not reflect underlying problems for example many companies now take large charges when they make acquisitions to write off the value of acquired research and development work such write offs presumably do not represent a real evaluation of the value of the companies being acquired and as such are routinely ignored by many analysts similarly companies that acquire other companies using the so called purchase method of accounting often end up putting a large value for intangible assets on their balance sheets which current accounting rules require be amortized over up to 40 years the exact amount amortized during any year may have no relationship to the real value of the acquired company so those numbers are also usually ignored those losses are higher for the nasdaq 100 this year because a number of them made large acquisitions and because some chose to take the write offs very rapidly thereby putting them behind them for example i2 technologies an internet software company acquired aspect development another software company last year and chose to amortize the intangible assets over just three years the result was that it took a 772 million charge in the final quarter more than twice the company 's revenues for the quarter but many of the biggest write offs this year represent losses that are quite real excite home 's 46 billion write off for example represented its decision to quit some businesses for which it had paid large sums but now realized had no future it also includes losses on investments in other companies whose share prices have collapsed similarly yahoo took a write down of 163 million for losses on its investments and amazoncom wrote down its investments in other companies by 155 million and wrote down the value of companies it had acquired by 184 million none of those losses were included in the earnings numbers the companies had highlighted if the cumulative write offs become much larger in coming quarters the nasdaq 100 could find itself with net losses

 in a closed session today the moscow city court denied bail to a business partner of mikhail b khodorkovsky russia 's richest man and one of its most powerful the court rejected an appeal to release the man platon lebedev on bail mr lebedev was arrested on july 2 and accused of violating a 1994 privatization program a charge he denies mr lebedev 's partner mr khodorkovsky has watched this month as prosecutors hit his allies and affiliated companies with a flurry of criminal charges including theft of state property tax evasion and even murder today 's decision was another setback for mr khodorkovsky mr lebedev is chairman of menatep a financial group at the heart of mr khodorkovsky 's empire the case against him is one of seven the numerous investigations are seen by mr khodorkovsky 's supporters as politically motivated an effort by some in the kremlin to reduce his power ahead of parliamentary elections in december the investigations have sent chills through the business community and civil liberties groups both contend that kremlin bureaucrats are secretly behind the investigations mr lebedev 's lawyers also contended that politics had influenced today 's court decision the price of shares in yukos mr khodorkovsky 's oil company fell 3 percent today on the news our lawyers were n't given the chance to get a clear explanation for why the session was closed the general director of menatep oleg ashurkov said the court did n't look at our lawyers arguments we conclude that the court was under unprecedented pressure the campaign against mr khodorkovsky has raised new questions about president vladimir v putin russia experts think the investigations were organized by a small group of kremlin officials civil liberties groups fear the influence of such hard liners in politics it has also been bad for business since the arrest of mr lebedev the russian stock market has fallen as much as 18 percent and yukos russia 's biggest oil company has lost more than 7 billion or a fifth of its value at the heart of the fight are property rights investors say that the series of cases involving the companies of mr khodorkovsky show that russia 's court system is too weak to protect the property of owners this could frighten off foreign investors who since mr putin was elected in the spring of 2000 had begun to see russia as an increasingly attractive place to put their money the international repercussions could very well be devastating said anders aslund senior associate at the carnegie endowment for international peace what foreign investor would dare invest in russia if even russia 's richest man is not safe mr aslund attributes the dispute to the approaching election campaign russian citizens tend to dislike tycoons like mr khodorkovsky many of whom amassed their fortunes during a tainted privatization program of the mid 1990 's consequently the campaign against mr khodorkovsky is likely to be popular with voters in some polls more than 70 percent have favored reviewing russia 's privatization program mr putin has refrained from making public statements though many think that he is involved in the campaign mr aslund said he expected the court cases to end no later than september when mr putin is scheduled to meet with president bush in new york but members of mr putin 's government including prime minister mikhail kasyanov have come to mr khodorkovsky 's defense today mr putin ordered mr kasyanov and his ministers to draft a plan to limit the influence of government in business a move that was seen by the business community as an ironic counterpoint to the day 's events this seems to be backsliding in precisely the area that the russian government argued that it had made the greatest gains said timothy j colton director of the davis center for russian and eurasian studies at harvard referring to economic growth

 the chairman of the pilots union at united air lines said yesterday that the pilots leadership had agreed to the 22 billion package in contract concessions as a way to help the airline avoid filing for bankruptcy protection at the same time the union chairman paul whiteford a united captain who is also a director of the ual corporation the airline 's parent criticized the federal air transportation stabilization board for putting too great a burden on airlines to prove their viability in order to obtain loan guarantees united 's 8800 pilots who are members of the air line pilots association will begin voting in the next few days on the tentative deal reached on friday night between the pilots union and the carrier the nation 's second largest the vote will be conducted by telephone and the union hopes to have it completed before thanksgiving the five year package calls for an 18 percent pay cut spread over the next two years as well as unspecified changes in work rules and job reductions beginning in 2005 pay would again increase by 46 percent a year and would regain 2002 levels by 2008 if approved by the union 's membership the provisions would take effect on dec 1 in a statement released after the agreement was reached glenn f tilton united 's chief executive said the deal provided solid evidence that the airline was making progress in its efforts to avoid bankruptcy mr tilton who joined ual in september from chevrontexaco said the unions were cooperating in an unprecedented manner mr whiteford said the package was meant to give united help as quickly as possible although mr tilton has said that a bankruptcy filing was not inevitable mr whiteford said the situation was urgent if this effort does n't go through i think it 's likely that barring some third party financing that we would have to look at an in court restructuring he said yesterday in an interview mr whiteford said the pilots understood the airline 's plight adding that as united 's highest paid union we have the most to gain by this company staying in business and the most to lose if this company goes out of business last month united 's pilots flight attendants and machinists said they would support 58 billion in concessions which the airline sought as part of its effort to secure a 18 billion government bailout specific pay cuts and other contract changes were left up to the individual unions whose members together hold about 55 percent of the company 's stock united based outside chicago has about 85000 employees talks between the airline and its mechanics are to resume this week said joe tiberi a spokesman for that union the international association of machinists he would not characterize how those talks are progressing the airline is also in negotiations with its flight attendants union a spokeswoman for the group was not available for comment yesterday like other major carriers united 's labor costs far exceed those of southwest airlines the leading low fare carrier united spends 467 cents per seat mile on labor the third highest rate in the industry compared with 307 cents at southwest according to an estimate from airlineforecast an industry consulting firm without concessions it projects labor costs at united are expected to pass 515 cents a mile in 2005 a united pilot flying the same boeing 737 aircraft used at southwest is now paid 244 an hour compared with 140 at southwest as part of the cutbacks analysts said they expected united to retire up to 50 more planes including about 20 boeing 747 400 jumbo jets at least a dozen boeing 767 200 's and its remaining boeing 737 200 aircraft mr whiteford of the pilots union acknowledged that there would be some reductions in fleet size saying we 've got to get leaner and meaner but declined to be more specific but he was critical of the stabilization board created in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks to oversee 10 billion in federal loan guarantees approved by congress to help the industry get back on its feet thus far only one application that of america west airlines has been approved by the board although a number of airlines have sought help mr whiteford said the board was unfairly requiring carriers to forecast industry conditions and guarantee a level of financial performance that might prove impossible given the uncertain state of air travel united last month revised its original application to include additional spending and job cuts even so some industry analysts predict that it has only a 50 50 chance of winning the board 's approval they should n't be into 'how competitive will you be five or six years from now mr whiteford said showing some irritation we have a network and assets and now we have proven that there is a coalition of all labor they should be interested in helping to stabilize the airline mr whiteford said the union planned to start a campaign in support of united 's application and would appeal to members of congress to support the application a spokeswoman for the board was not available for comment on sunday members of united 's management met with board officials last week and are expected to have further meetings this week kevin p mitchell president of the business travel coalition which represents corporations and business travelers agreed that the board was being overly demanding they have the ability to restructure the industry said mr mitchell whose group supports united 's application he said united 's viability depended on how swiftly it could pull together its recovery plan along with obtaining union concessions united also faces a 300 million interest payment to a german special purpose lender kfw on nov 17 the company is in talks with officials of the lender over whether the payment date can be extended two larger debt payments come up in december
 the director of the federal emergency management agency promised members of the new york congressional delegation yesterday that the agency would immediately reopen more than 7000 applications for housing assistance that the agency denied after the sept 11 terrorist attacks the director joseph m allbaugh said he had ordered the review because of what he called a perception that fema has denied assistance to those who should have received it he said that the thousands of rejected cases would be reviewed by a select group of caseworkers and that steps would be taken to avoid misunderstandings about exactly who is eligible and to ensure that all eligible cases are assisted the announcement came after days of increasing criticism in congress about the agency 's performance in responding to the sept 11 attacks to date the agency has disbursed far less in individual assistance to people economically affected by the attacks than it has in most major disasters in part because it has rejected 7 out of 10 applicants for housing aid the problems with the agency 's distribution of aid were detailed in the new york times last week mr allbaugh 's decision will affect applications to the agency 's mortgage and rental assistance program which covers up to 18 months of mortgage or rent payments for anyone in a major disaster area who lost at least 25 percent of his income as a result of the catastrophe local relief officials at first expected that the fema housing aid program would offer just the sort of assistance needed to address the deep widespread economic damage caused by the terrorist attacks government officials have estimated that about 75000 jobs and 45 billion in income were lost to people in the new york disaster region but interviews and the agency 's own records show that those who were rejected included hundreds of chinatown seamstresses and manhattan hotel workers many of them with claims to aid that seemed legitimate in one case raised with the agency by representatives jerrold nadler and nita m lowey both new york democrats the agency denied help to a disabled veteran who sold hats and gloves on the sidewalks of lower broadway even though he provided sworn statements from shopkeepers confirming that he was a regular vendor in the area this was uncharacteristic of fema said senator charles e schumer democrat of new york i have a lot of faith that this will be corrected and corrected quickly in a letter to mr nadler yesterday mr allbaugh encouraged him to forward to the agency any specific cases that have not been approved but which appear such as those mentioned in your letter to be obvious cases for assistance the housing aid rejection rate much higher than in previous disasters is part of the reason that the federal emergency management agency has provided less than 65 million in individual assistance for families in the disaster area by comparison the agency ultimately spent more than 14 billion in similar direct financial help to families affected by the northridge earthquake in california in 1994 the agency has acknowledged that one reason the payouts have been low is that thousands of people were denied housing aid after the agency decided to limit benefits to those who could prove that their lost income was a direct result of the attacks that new standard which goes beyond the laws and regulations that have traditionally governed disaster relief efforts substantially raised the burden of proof on jobless workers trying to qualify in addition some agency officials said their housing assistance efforts had been plagued by missteps in one some 15000 people received faulty aid applications that increased the risk of rejection mr allbaugh 's announcement yesterday does not specifically address the new direct result requirement which he defended in a recent interview as a fiscally responsible way of preventing unemployed workers far from the designated disaster areas from claiming assistance but he did agree to meet with members of congress from the region to discuss the criteria for qualifying for the program said senator jon s corzine a democrat from new jersey fema 's apparent decision to change the eligibility standard without any basis in law to do so could be depriving thousands of the assistance they need to keep their homes pay their bills and feed their families mr corzine said in a letter to mr allbaugh on tuesday yesterday mr corzine said that mr allbaugh indicated that the direct result standard is how he is being told he has to interpret the statute both mr corzine and mr schumer said that they had volunteered to work with the federal agency on any statutory changes necessary to extend and improve the housing aid program which is scheduled to expire this month mr schumer said he had been assured by mr allbaugh that new york would ultimately get all the aid it deserved but he is concerned that if we do n't clarify the law people in cincinnati will claim eligibility for the program mr schumer said the agency 's role in the continuing relief efforts for people in new york and northern virginia including those thrown out of work when reagan national airport was temporarily closed is increasingly important major charities have for months been cutting back on their aid to economic victims of the attacks whose unemployment benefits will soon expire some officials at the agency who opposed the tightened standard said privately that the high rejection rate for the housing aid program demonstrated that thousands of needy families facing eviction or foreclosure were unable to meet the stricter standard on sunday a coalition of community organizations including the chinese staff and workers association and the puerto rican legal defense and education fund will hold a town hall meeting in front of the federal emergency management agency 's offices at 141 worth street in lower manhattan to focus attention on problems their members have had in dealing with the agency correction may 3 2002 friday a front page article yesterday about the federal emergency management agency 's reopening of more than 7000 rejected applications for housing aid misstated the location for a meeting called by community groups with complaints about the agency it will be 2 to 5 pm on sunday at public school 124 40 division street in manhattan not at 141

 can new yorkers be bribed to behave our first experiment ended in failure as reported in this space last week handing out 20 bills in riverside park to people with their dogs on a leash seemed to have no effect on the rate of compliance with the leash law they were not even moved by the big city civility award certificates that accompanied the cash duly humbled i lowered my sights to another law the pooper scooper ordinance armed with more cash and congratulatory certificates i put on my referee shirt once again and staked out the block of 90th street between amsterdam and columbus my survey of the neighborhood showed that the block had the highest concentration of pooper scooper violations per square meter during two mornings and evenings i handed out 5 bills to dog owners who cleaned up after their animals once they and the block 's residents got an explanation for my uniform ref or foot locker one man asked they generally applauded the civility campaign unlike the dog owners in the park who defended the informal tradition of ignoring the leash law between 9 pm and 9 am no one claimed any exemption from the pooper scooper law it 's disgusting not to clean up after your dog but people around here do it all the time said the owner of rocky a pit bull mix when i see it happen i want to say something but the kind of people who do n't clean up are n't the kind of people you want to tell to clean up in new york you got to choose your battles i 'm not going down over this one over the course of a week i gave out 50 in awards and this time the labors did not seem in vain the incidence of violations as measured by inspections of the pavement at 8 30 am declined after a week to 14 from 29 dog owners it seemed would clean up for 5 even though they would n't leash their animals for 20 are there any lessons here in regulating new yorkers behavior i reported the data to peter van doren the editor of regulation a professional journal published by the cato institute he said the results jibed with a large body of research into the problems of regulating public lands even when you 're dealing with public property you have to consider people 's implicit notions of property rights dr van doren said dog owners recognize that they do n't have the right to leave poop on the sidewalk but they think they 're entitled to unleash their dogs in the early morning hours in the park so it will take a lot more than 20 to change that behavior it 's the same problem you face in preventing environmental damage to public lands in the west from ranchers and snowmobilers they demand generous compensation for giving up what they see as their right suppose then that the city or a community group started an awards program just for behavior that enjoyed widespread support like cleaning up after your dog how much should the award be giving out 5 awards regularly on every block would be expensive and possibly counterproductive because people might start expecting to be paid for not polluting society ca n't afford to pay you for everything you 're supposed to do dr van doren said our culture depends on people doing many things out of altruism and altruistic people become upset when whey see other people accepting payment for what they 're already doing for free there 's been a long running debate over the effects of paying people to give blood free market types think it increases the overall supply but liberals worry that it undermines the efforts by the red cross to recruit volunteers even liberals though seem comfortable with a subtle form of payment for altruism charity raffles which offer a few random awards to encourage public spirited behavior there could be similar awards given out randomly for civil behavior on the street a referee might take a walk once a month say and hand out a 500 award to the first dog owner observed following the pooper scooper law the odds of winning would be so long that no dog owner would expect to be paid but the prospect of getting lucky might induce some owners to be more diligent especially the type who drive to connecticut for powerball lottery tickets this approach might well be less expensive than trying to catch violators in the act and it would certainly be more pleasant to administer not that i 'm volunteering for the job i 've seen enough dog waste it 's time to hang up the referee shirt and let others carry on
 harvard law school will allow military recruiters back on its campus bowing to pressure from the department of defense rather than risk losing 328 million of harvard university 's federal financing the law school has denied military recruiters access to its career services office since at least 1979 because the military which rejects openly gay members violates the school 's antidiscrimination policy robert c clark dean of the law school said in an interview the policy prohibits bias on the basis of sexual orientation but military recruiters still visited the campus as guests of the harvard law school veterans association actions that dean clark said were part of the dichotomy between the antidiscrimination policy and free speech there is no hostility at all toward the military dean clark said but there is a very strong disagreement with their policy we 'll express our disagreement at every possible public occasion the school 's decision was first reported today in the boston globe in 1998 the air force determined that the arrangement with the veterans group met the provisions of a 1996 federal law that made a school 's federal financing contingent on its allowing military recruiters on campus the air force revisited the law school 's policy last year and in may notified dean clark that the school did not meet the law 's provisions were the school not to comply the entire university would lose the 328 million in federal money about 16 percent of its operating budget after consulting with harvard 's president lawrence h summers and members of the law school faculty dean clark made his decision most of us reluctantly accept the reality that this university can not accept the loss of federal funds he said in his statement david illingworth associate dean of harvard college said the university 's undergraduate program allowed recruiters to work through its career services office for us the reason why we allow them on campus is because it 's the federal government mr illingworth said the federal government makes the exception in the discrimination rule not us lindsay harrison a third year student at harvard law and member of lambda a gay and lesbian group said students planned to protest the move i vacillate between frustration with the government and frustration with the university ms harrison said but the realities being what they are dean clark had no choice but to cave sheldon steinbach general counsel at the american council on education said the school 's decision would cause other institutions that ban recruiters to examine their policies correction september 5 2002 thursday an article on aug 28 about harvard law school 's admission of military recruiters to its campus misidentified the news organization that first reported the decision it was the associated press not the boston globe
 the day after his inauguration president bush sat for an official portrait taken by a los angeles times photographer named paul morse what was a times photographer doing taking official white house photographs in some respects he was following in the footsteps of better known photographers like david hume kennerly who left journalism temporarily to work in gerald ford 's white house the problem was mr morse had not yet left journalism this is a pretty ridiculous conflict of interest said dean baquet the managing editor of the los angeles times and a former national editor of the new york times this was not even debatable some of mr baquet 's subordinates however had not seen it that way one of the deputy directors of photography had given mr morse permission to take the portrait for the president mr morse said he had sought the permission because he was concerned about the conflict of interest knowing we cover the white house but he noted he was a general assignment photographer who did sports and feature photography in los angeles not political coverage in washington he said he took the portrait to help out eric draper the former associated press campaign photographer who had just taken over as official white house photographer and he said i thought it was a big honor to be able to shoot that picture it took roughly four days for word of mr morse 's freelance work at the white house to reach mr baquet by that time the photographer had already taken pictures some of mr bush and some of his dog mr morse was preparing to take an official portrait of vice president dick cheney he called back to his office to make sure that this assignment too would be acceptable that was when larry armstrong the photography director told mr morse he would have to choose between the times and the white house mr morse decided not to take the cheney picture instead he flew home and resigned he started a new job at the white house last week but the echoes of mr baquet 's displeasure can still be heard in the los angeles newsroom where every photographer has been asked to report all freelance activity when some photographers questioned why the request applied to them alone mr baquet said he extended it to the entire newsroom felicity barringer

 as baseball officials and owners paint an increasingly bleaker picture of baseball 's economics two teams have stepped forward as exhibits a and b the tampa bay devil rays and the detroit tigers recently experienced payroll problems and needed bank loans to pay their players people in baseball familiar with the problems said yesterday both teams said they have had no trouble meeting their payrolls but the people who disclosed the developments provided specific details of how the devil rays and the tigers resolved their problems and averted being plunged into uncharted financial territory players are paid twice monthly and it was the june 15 payment the devil rays and the tigers were having trouble with the people who told about it said the tigers one of them said also faced a problem with next monday 's payroll but worked out that one too bob dupuy chief operating officer of major league baseball declined to comment on the identity of the teams or their specific problems but he said i believe any issues with regard to meeting expenses currently have been resolved and that there 's no immediate problem for any team he added that any problems that might have existed were a matter of cash flow and ongoing expenses these potential payroll problems are a reflection of the economic problems major league baseball says its lower revenue clubs face commissioner bud selig reiterated this week his contention that some teams are in deep financial trouble and baseball has hammered home that point in its negotiations with the players union for a new labor contract the owners are seeking an agreement that would provide financial relief while the union feels the owners proposals would make too much of an inroad into players salaries one person who told of the problems said the tigers secured a commercial loan backed by a guarantee from the team owner michael ilitch to make next week 's payroll for the june 15 payrolls the tigers and the devil rays secured loans using distributions from baseball 's central fund as collateral the central fund is the repository for revenue from such sources as the national television package and licensing the commissioner 's office periodically though not on a regular schedule distributes money from the fund to the 30 teams as an aid to the devil rays and the tigers the commissioner 's office wrote a letter confirming that the central fund money would be distributed to all of the teams this month the two teams presented the letter to their banks and as a result the banks lent them money against that distribution to cover their payrolls the devil rays experience was reminiscent of one they encountered last season in may when vincent naimoli the team 's managing partner was involved in a nasty fight with his five partners the club was facing difficulty in meeting the player payroll but naimoli added his own money to the team treasury and paid the players with some of that the devils rays problems have apparently been so dire this season that two people said they have offered to sell players to other teams because they have needed the cash naimoli declined to return a telephone call seeking comment but a devil rays spokesman rick vaughn said it was not true that the club was having difficulty meeting its payroll ilitch the tigers owner did not return a call seeking comment dave dombrowski the club president said he was not involved in those matters but said we 've met our payroll and do n't feel there 's any problem and we 'll continue to meet our payrolls the financial health of the teams has been the dominant issue in the collective bargaining talks that resumed yesterday in manhattan on the day of the all star game selig was asked at a news conference whether baseball during its negotiations with the players could have made its case more emphatically if it had let a team or two go bankrupt i have said that and the clubs have said that to me he replied they know i 've helped two or three clubs out in the past year or two and yes i now understand in retrospect that maybe it would have been better to let them go it certainly would have been another dynamic manifestation of the problems he added earlier this season selig said six to eight teams could wind up in bankruptcy if there were a work stoppage at a recent bargaining session dupuy told union representatives that if there were a prolonged work stoppage caused by either side once they reached an agreement on the major issues they would not be talking about back service credit for players but about clubs not coming back in the years since salaries began escalating owners have handled their financial situations differently when ewing kauffman owned the kansas city royals he poured part of his personal fortune into the team to pay its best players and maintain its status as a perennial contender he said he acted for the benefit of the community h wayne huizenga on the other hand treated the florida marlins as strictly business when he felt his losses had become too great he sold the team though not until he had dismantled the 1997 world series champions rather than incur greater losses while he still owned them in the continuing labor negotiations the clubs want the players to agree to a system in which teams would share 50 percent of their local revenue as a means of improving the chances of low revenue teams to compete with the wealthier clubs negotiators had been scheduled to meet during the day yesterday but instead turned the session into a dinner meeting at a restaurant they planned to meet again today we discussed all of the major issues and it was a constructive discussion gene orza the union 's associate general counsel said of last night 's gathering baseball 's claims of financial woe could have an adverse effect on the ability of its teams to secure low interest loans sal galatioto head of lehman brothers holdings inc 's sports finance unit told bloomberg news yesterday that it makes people worry about the overall financial state of baseball and they were already concerned because of the possibility of a strike teams often borrow money during the season to cover expenses or new payroll additions
 architecture is a protagonist in the public realm often it is called upon to enact the primal drama of loss and compensation when the loss is great compensation is often visualized in terms of civic grandeur the losses this year were incalculable the attacks on the world trade center were felt across many dimensions of space and time from the neighborhood to the globe from the televised real time moment to history 's multiple points of view the attacks target was modern civilization civilization fought back not just with weapons and slogans but with the capacity to contemplate its highly complex self the attack drove home the importance of discriminating between modern progressive outlooks and oppressive feudal ones discrimination was the big story in architecture this year this matters that does n't this is useful that 's a waste of time this feeds into the future that is stuck in a dead end clarity itself came into sharper focus this is an idea that is a box of orange jell o this is architecture that is etc etc etc such distinctions are not easily made but they are worth the time and effort it takes to form cultivated opinions the need for more penetrating analytic tools became urgent before sept 11 in march a team of real estate developers organized a competition to select the architects to plan an office and residential complex for the so called con ed site a nine acre property on the east river waterfront just south of the united nations headquarters announced with great fanfare as an international search for architects of major talent the competition invited submissions from three winners of the pritzker architecture prize and other noted figures on the world stage it ended with the choice of two local firms of lesser distinction during the selection process richard meier and peter eisenman withdrew after they were asked to play a subordinate role as consulting architects rodolfo machado and jorge silvetti boston architects who had agreed to participate as consultants later resigned as well in the past episodes like this tended to fall beneath a critic 's radar on the premise that all architects are created equal it is often assumed that only fully realized designs should be subject to critical appraisal actually all phases of the building art including zoning economics politics context history aesthetics and ideology fall within the traditional scope of critical interpretation to these factors must be added the inflated and inflationary pressures of professional marketing architects operate in an increasingly competitive market and in an aesthetically eclectic period that is not guided by educated consensus on matters of taste or style the profession benefits from the myth that its members can not be qualitatively ranked the con ed competition illustrated h h richardson 's belief that the first law of american architecture was to get the job the developers did n't want to pay for architecture but richardson never suggested that marketing should be the only law concepts other than social darwinism should make an appearance from time to time architects ca n't buck the market system and should n't try they should use the system as an intellectual as well as an economic framework they should make vivid architecture from the system 's inherent contradictions how can you criticize people for doing what they think is right i was asked that question in one form or another many times this past year my routine answer i read a lot of history in the weeks following the attacks the con ed competition came to seem like a warm up for the full dress performance of an anxious status quo the city 's leading corporate architecture firms linked arms with their developer clients to devise strategies for turning a catastrophe into a business opportunity an ad hoc group the nyc rebuild infrastructure task force convinced its members that they had earned the moral stature of firefighters medical personnel emergency volunteers onlookers were less persuaded the attacks required the entire city to draw on its deepest resources of historical awareness and imaginative reflection but it did not entitle architects to assume that they had been awarded a special franchise to answer the call survivors philosophers firefighters shopkeepers musicians window dressers and dentists have at least as much right to the public 's attention all of us have had to fight feelings of helplessness quite a few projects did deserve the limelight this year in new york they included the american museum of folk art designed by tod williams and billie tsien the prada store in soho by rem koolhaas the neue galerie new york by annabelle selldorf and the melrose community center in the bronx by diana agrest and mario gandelsonas there were also promising designs for future projects by norman foster jean nouvel gwathmey siegel and elizabeth diller and ricardo scofidio preservationists rallied to prevent the disfigurement of eero saarinen 's twa terminal at kennedy airport out of town there were openings of new buildings by mr koolhaas tadao ando santiago calatrava and rafael vinoly i was n't able to cover most of those works the unfolding of events in the politics of new york architecture was a story i could n't overlook this story was not in any case so divorced from the aesthetics of architecture as you might think the political story went far toward explaining why the city 's architecture so seldom registers on the artistic scale from my window at home i have a good view of the secretariat building of the united nations it was completed just half a century ago it was my beacon on the skyline throughout 2001 this was a year in which many including those of us who are not pacifists decided that world peace was n't too corny a topic to think about the architects of the united nations headquarters were among the heroic figures of a great generation like the members of the united nations they were not afraid to face the contradictions of their time particularly those that emerged from conflicts between global and regional perspectives nor were they afraid to be criticized for doing what they believed was right as they understood it generating conflict was essential to the development of discrimination looking back at contemporary commentary on the united nations much of it hostile you will realize that great architecture seldom reinforces preconceived ideas of normalcy it parts company with them and in the process reveals conflicts that have long been lurking underground such revelations provide the fuel that drives public life forward

 nike said yesterday that its third quarter profit would fall short of forecasts because of problems with an inventory system that led to shortages and late deliveries the company is in the middle of a 400 million upgrade of its worldwide system for managing inventory orders and other aspects of what is known as the supply chain the company said that problems with the new system caused shortages in many products and delayed shipments to compensate for the shortages the company said it ordered so many shoes that it will be trying to work through excess inventory for months to come in some cases by funneling the goods to factory stores and outlet stores executives at nike based in beaverton ore said during a conference call that they expected the company to earn 34 to 38 cents a share for the quarter ended feb 28 far below its previous estimate of 50 to 55 cents a share analysts had expected nike to earn 53 cents a share according to first call thomson financial the company said it still expected to meet fourth quarter estimates of 60 to 65 cents a share nike had expected its third quarter to be flat compared with results in the period a year earlier because of weakness in our us footwear revenues philip h knight the chairman and chief executive said in a statement the technical problems however will now cause revenue to fall he said mr knight said that the upgrade of the inventory system would in the long term bring significant financial and organizational benefit to the company nike 's business is healthy in every area except one mr knight said international sales have been strong and new products like the nikeshox and presto lines have drawn consumer interest but we have more work to do he said pledging to focus on the important but underserved midprice segment of the market nike has also been losing market share in the united states to competitors like reebok in a conference call for analysts donald blair the chief financial officer said we are certainly disappointed with what 's happened here but we believe we 're going to get it right and we believe we 've got it stabilized now the company made its announcement after the stock market closed yesterday in regular trading shares of nike rose 17 cents to 4917 but they fell as low as 4030 after hours many companies are trying to save money through the use of technology tools that simplify inventory ordering and other functions but the transition can be tricky one analyst said that the news hit especially hard because nike seemed to be rebounding from a dreary spell what 's so disappointing is that nike is making headway on the product front said carol a murray of salomon smith barney the new shoes had started to create some excitement in the category again they are not the first company in the apparel or footwear industry to experience disruption in implementation of these types of systems it just outlines how complex the whole process is she added it 's not because they 've done something so terribly wrong you ca n't sell that which you do n't have in an interview a spokeswoman for nike said that the setbacks were temporary we feel that it 's probably going to take several months to work through this inventory said leslye l mundy the company 's director of global media relations by the end of this calendar year we 're very confident that we 're going to be able to get back on track
 officially of course it will always be the b train but just take it on any given sunday evening along about half of its southerly course and you might agree that it would not be much of an exaggeration to give the subway line a subtitle the fish train whoa man it smells like fish in here said ramon vasquez a hotel maintenance worker on sunday mr vasquez was on his way home to brooklyn aboard a sparsely populated b train when a bracing aroma boarded at the grand street station in chinatown it got on along with about 20 chinese american brooklynites each carrying two armfuls of diaphanous bright orange plastic bags bulging with all manner of food sweet potato leaves flowering chives slender purple eggplant brown litchi but first and foremost with fish why asked jin hua chung a steam press operator who moved to bensonhurst from chinatown five years ago but still buys fish only on mott street because i like fresh that 's why and only chinatown gives me fresh said mr chung 60 from one of whose orange plastic bags poked the head of a good size tilapia which had been yanked live from a fish market tank only a couple of minutes before he and his wife share kitchen duties but i am the better cook he says the sunday subway fish migration has been growing for a long time now as chinese immigrants have fanned out in greater numbers from manhattan to brooklyn neighborhoods and yet seem to return en masse to manhattan on weekends to do all their food shopping it can be seen to some degree on a number of trains that serve other chinatowns the n and r to brooklyn the 6 train from canal street to grand central where the fish make their transfer to the 7 and back to flushing but the migration is at its most concentrated and pungent aboard the b train which provides the fastest way to get from chinatown to sunset park the largest chinese american enclave in brooklyn and on a nice late spring sunday it can seem as if thousands of pounds of fish are making their way to brooklyn along the b bag by plastic bag tucked beneath the feet of thousands of riders bound for thousands of steamers and soup pots among the exporters on sunday was a 35 year old man named wu just wu please waiting by the turnstiles for his wife who does all the fish shopping for their family he is in charge of the vegetables there was ying hsu a law student and her boyfriend dan goldschmidt a lawyer who had found what they needed and were bound for brooklyn i just got salmon reported ms hsu almost sheepishly a very generic american fish there was lisa mui an unemployed bartender from sheepshead bay who had accompanied her mother on a grocery run i love the scene said ms mui who had elaborate fingernails and a pierced tongue i do love the scene but to be honest it 's really all about the food later asked whether the chicken they bought in chinatown tasted better than supermarket chicken she rolled her eyes and glanced at her mother and said as long as it does n't talk to me when i eat it it 's fine by me the contest for most popular whole fish sunday seemed to be a dead heat between striped bass and tilapia a type of african lake fish that is now widely farmed around the world and has become a staple in many chinese homes tilapia is also said to have been the fish that jesus multiplied along with the loaves to feed the multitudes the contest for most widely used color of plastic shopping bag was not even close deep jack o' lantern orange which has become a kind of calling card of chinatown groceries and fishmongers bright red ran a distant second and pink third orange is a lucky color that 's why said kenny tran a manager at the tan my my market on the corner of chrystie street and grand close enough to the subway entrance to hit with a scallop black looks horrible and white you know why people do n't use white because white is always for the dead while sunday 's fish migration seemed festive enough one man was seen lugging home a case of budweiser along with his catch there was a lot of noticeable mourning going on too because by the end of the summer the fish train will be no more at least for a while repairs to the manhattan bridge will mean that the b will not run to grand street and the station will be nearly shut down for more than two years the fish will still make their way to brooklyn of course but probably in smaller schools on different trains it might even be difficult to smell which ones and mr chung is not happy they say this is a developed country he said if they knew this bridge was going to have so many problems why could n't they have built another one

 david levering lewis the pulitzer prize winning biographer of w e b du bois and an eminent black historian who considers president bush 's policies on iraq a menace was flabbergasted when he received an invitation from laura bush 's office to be the keynote speaker at a white house symposium on the writers of the harlem renaissance ursula smith who with her partner linda peavy has chronicled the ordinary lives of the american frontier was similarly taken aback when mrs bush 's office extended an invitation for both historians to speak at a symposium on the women writers of the west i did n't think i could with any kind of integrity walk into a white house that i take such exception to said ms smith who disagrees with mr bush on iraq the environment and many other issues and justin kaplan a pulitzer prize winning biographer of mark twain who says mr bush has a troglodytic approach to social and economic problems was so surprised by his invitation from the white house to a symposium on twain that he told the aide in the first lady 's office he would have to get back to her but all four not only turned up in the east room they came away startled and impressed by a first lady who is quietly creating her own separate space within a presidency focused on war while karl rove mr bush 's chief political adviser gives the president political biographies and invites like minded historians to speak mrs bush has reached out beyond ideology there 's nothing political about american literature mrs bush said in a telephone interview saturday acknowledging that some of her guests were not sympathetic to her husband everyone can like american literature no matter what your party mrs bush a former teacher and librarian who will be the host of the second annual national book festival on the lawn of the capitol this weekend has so far held three white house events showcasing american literature all of them open to the press but largely ignored except for reruns on c span i wish they had a bigger audience she said each symposium twain last november the harlem renaissance this past march and the women writers of the west in september was held on a day when news of afghanistan or iraq overshadowed it but many participants are convinced that publicity is not mrs bush 's primary motive and that the events are rooted in the identity she established before she married into what became an american political dynasty certainly the audiences of 200 invited by the white house for the events district of columbia high school students spouses of administration officials old friends of the first lady are not designed to impress social washington or otherwise attract attention i think it probably nourishes her and feeds her said patricia maclachlan the author of the children 's book sarah plain and tall who was a speaker at the symposium on women of the west it validates who she is where she came from and what she values participants have also been surprised by the contents of the two hour events although they do not break academic ground they are often highly literary and tackle topics like race feminism and class not normally discussed in the formal splendor of the east room mr kaplan for example bluntly told the crowd last fall that mark twain was far more interested in writing about money than about sex it was a kind of pornography of the dollar mr kaplan said he adored money but at the same time he was terrified of it mrs bush always sits in the front row often nodding and beaming i chose mark twain to start with because i believe that mark twain is the first real american writer she said in the interview i think mark twain really talks about everything that is at the crux of what america is even now participants have also been surprised by the choice of authors who are always selected by mrs bush when patricia nelson limerick a leading historian of the american west and the author of the influential revisionist history the legacy of conquest was asked to speak about the western writers willa cather edna ferber and laura ingalls wilder in september she had to read ferber 's giant for the first time and came away stunned it is quite a penetrating mocking portrait of texas rich people and particularly of people making their money in oil ms limerick said adding that she at first could not imagine that the first lady with her roots in texas would have selected such a book for white house discussion but when mrs bush spoke in her opening remarks at that symposium of ferber 's shock at the swaggering arrogance of men in 10 gallon hats ms limerick knew that mrs bush was no stranger to the themes of giant i did mrs bush a terrible disservice thinking that maybe she did n't know that she thought these were all little houses on the prairie ms limerick said mrs bush said she chose the harlem renaissance as a topic because she has always loved the poetry of langston hughes not surprisingly one guest at the harlem symposium was arnold rampersad of stanford hughes 's biographer who recalled overhearing mrs bush talk informally after the event about what writers she should select for the next symposium she talked about willa cather and katherine anne porter mr rampersad said that was the moment when it became very clear that she was seeing this world from the inside not the outside mrs bush who is currently rereading the memoirs of lillian hellman said she was already thinking of what writers should be next she said she was toying with the idea of emily dickinson and walt whitman but was also thinking of faulkner hemingway and fitzgerald and i love truman capote she said i think he 'd be fabulous
 oxygen the women 's cable network turned one last week the network was started by three of the most powerful women in show business marcy carsey the television producer geraldine laybourne the television executive credited with making the children 's network nickelodeon a success and oprah winfrey the television talk show host despite having such a powerful founding troika the network struggled a bit in its first year with programming and distribution to homes that have cable notably absent from the fray was ms winfrey who was busy starting her own very successful magazine o the oprah magazine around the same time aside from starring in 12 episodes of an oxygen show that was a sort of primer on the internet called oprah goes online ms winfrey was not much of a physical presence so it was not without quite a bit of joy that the executives at oxygen announced yesterday that ms winfrey would produce a new program in the untitled series ms winfrey will tell the stories of real life heroes who have done or do extraordinary things for others ms winfrey will narrate segments about her subjects and interview them executives said it would make its debut this summer the network also announced that ms winfrey 's harpo entertainment would produce two original movies for the network this is the sort of role that ms laybourne and ms carsey said they had always envisioned for ms winfrey when they recruited her for the venture because she tends to draw so many women to whatever she produces the executives hope is clearly that when fans learn that ms winfrey will be on the show they will call their cable companies to demand oxygen and the cable companies that do not carry it will feel pressured to get it i think it will be something that people will take notice of ms laybourne said and we 'll certainly do our part to make sure they do jim rutenberg
 when my pager sounded last october i had enough time to grab an overnight bag and run we had just been deployed to yemen in the aftermath of the uss cole bombing as we climbed aboard a massive c 5 military transport plane i left a message on our answering machine this might take a couple weeks i told my wife watch the news and tell the kids i love them i have never been very good at goodbyes when you work for the fbi 's critical incident response group missions spring up out of life with little or no warning like the waco siege which started with a call outside dirty charlie 's burger joint and ended eight weeks later sorry about jake 's hockey game you say racing to the airport i 'll make it up to him when i get back broken promises tend to rub on you after the adrenaline subsides especially on nights alone with nothing to think of but regrets my family had been through this before during a trip to kosovo in 1999 65 of us had to share one satellite phone in the middle of a rye field calling home meant waking up in the night standing under the stars and pretending that no one could hear you or that foreign intelligence services were n't listening in leaky plumbing and the chicken pox take on a whole new meaning when someone named fawas is taking notes in the first two weeks our investigation in yemen had gone smoothly our joint operations command post was at the aden hotel i had just checked in for the night when a fellow agent handed me a note that changed everything it read in part intelligence sources have discovered an immediate and credible threat to personnel in the aden hotel in the cryptic lexicon of the intelligence community immediate and credible means they 're coming for you now everyone in the middle east from schoolchildren to osama bin laden knew where we were staying if a suicide bomber wanted to drive a truckload of explosives right up to the concierge desk there was n't a thing we could do about it are you going to get it over quick in the lobby one of my colleagues asked or ride the building down i laughed at his macabre humor then started writing to my wife rosie if you get this note i stopped if you get this note i had n't even said goodbye the kitchen faucet still leaked my guitar needed new strings strange things run through your mind when you believe you 're about to die to hell with operational security i thought we had two satellite phones down the hall the fbi could n't discipline me if i was dead i punched in an access code and dialed home hello my wife said when she answered hi rosie i said how are you baby she asked it 's hot over here but i 'm ok how are the kids they 're fine she paused at the echo when are you coming home not for a while i answered seventeen sailors died on the cole in a firestorm of fuel and steel the bomb headed our way would n't be kinder i was n't coming home none of us were i just wanted to hear your voice i said trying to sound cheerful i did n't want her to remember my last words as a lie i love you occurred to me after she had hung up but maybe it was best that i never said it my voice would have broken and she would have wondered why it was the same conversation we had stumbled through so many times before just a handful of words had to hold us for months it was after 1 am when i hung up i lay down on my bed holding my gun wondering whether my family would hear about the bomb on cnn or if someone would call first it felt strange not being able to fight back but there was no one to fight it 's the dread of terrorism that wears you down i had survived threats like this before maybe a part of me did n't really think it could happen sometime near dawn i fell asleep a few hours later i awoke to the sounds of muslims praying my first thought was n't gratitude but surprise we never found out why the bombers never came i explained the call three weeks later as i caught up on report cards and soccer scores my wife seldom asked about missions but this time i wanted her to understand i 'm glad you did n't tell me she said when i finished i do n't know how i would have gotten through the night there was no sadness in her voice just relief she had her ways of coping too i nodded my head as i held her there would be another mission tomorrow or the next day maybe that 's why i 'm no good at goodbyes they remind you of how much you have to leave behind lives christopher whitcomb has been an fbi agent for 15 years he is the author of cold zero inside the fbi hostage rescue team to be published by little brown this month
 the opposition northern alliance mobilized at least three attack units north of kabul today in what could be the first sign of an offensive against taliban forces on the front line here alliance commanders declined to discuss the move but soldiers in the units said at least 900 special attack troops had been ordered to report to their bases for duty they said they expected to be assaulting taliban lines near here within days in recent days alliance officials have said they will curtail their military operations during the islamic holy month of ramadan which begins in mid november the two sides have fought through the holy month in the past but alliance officials fear that if they attack during ramadan that might turn muslim opinion against them that leaves two and a half weeks for the alliance to stage attacks in this area which is 35 miles north of kabul as well as around the strategic cities of mazar i sharif and taliqan there appeared to be little military activity around taliqan today and alliance attacks in mazar i sharif have slowed in recent days at 11 am today col abdul jalil surveyed 300 of the assault troops as they stood in formation at their base in the village of tutumdara the colonel and his soldiers appeared comfortable confident and relaxed we have had a few days off he said referring to a recent leave we are ready if the alliance attacks here it faces a difficult task an estimated 5000 to 10000 taliban soldiers man a maze of pillboxes mine fields and trenches on the other side of the front line alliance forces here are believed to number between 3000 and 5000 american jets have been bombing front line positions across northern afghanistan for eight days but alliance commanders have complained that the strikes have not been heavy or continuous enough to weaken the enemy sufficiently the bombs they complained have been dispersed among taliban targets in kabul mazar i sharif and taliqan rather than being concentrated to pound a single front line repeatedly if they do pierce the taliban line alliance officials have promised to advance only as far as the outskirts of kabul they would then wait for a local or international security force to enter the city the success of any offensive will depend largely on units like the one colonel abdul commands called zarbati or rapid they were created by the alliance 's former military commander ahmed shah massoud who was assassinated last month general massoud tried to replace an army made up primarily of local militia forces who were haphazardly armed wore no uniforms and were loyal primarily to their local commanders the soldiers in the zarbati units are volunteers who are paid twice as much as their comrades given uniforms and placed in units comprising troops from different parts of the country they receive six months of training and live on military bases instead of at home today the zarbati soldiers in tutumdara seemed almost relieved to have been called up they are a mix of old and young muhammad naim a 40 year old who said he had 20 years of combat experience dating to the soviet intervention here proudly explained that he was his unit 's rocket man he is responsible for handling the 10 man squad 's rocket propelled grenade he said he had destroyed or disabled 10 tanks with the weapon at noon abdel nasir ziai a political officer showed up to give the soldiers a speech he praised the men who had recently served for four months in northern afghanistan for their work there he told the soldiers they were fighting terrorism and foreign invaders a reference to the pakistani and arab volunteers who fight alongside the taliban and are vilified here he told the soldiers they were fighting for afghanistan 's right to control its destiny and for a multiethnic democratic country he then invoked the memory of general massoud and concluded by wishing the men well as i see you happy here today i hope i 'll see you the same way in the squares of kabul he said all the civilians in kabul are waiting for you it is difficult to judge how well these soldiers might fare against the dizzying array of fortifications built along this front line in six years of fighting several soldiers said they would be able to break the line using their training any attack is likely to be at night and led by special teams that will first clear a path in the mine fields for soldiers squads of 10 will then move in and try to seize trenches and bunkers but it will be very difficult for the soldiers to have any element of surprise since the american bombing began and as it continued tonight small arms fire has flared along the front line with the taliban soldiers firing at the slightest hint of a northern alliance advance but aqapacha a 27 year old soldier in the unit said he was confident that they could breach taliban defenses he is a specialist with a pikati a powerful russian made rifle that can fire about 2800 yards the young soldier known as his squad 's pika man showed the same confidence and high spirits as other soldiers when asked how well he could shoot his weapon if you want go sit 1000 meters away from me he said i 'll shoot you

 robert frank the photographer best known for the americans a book of 83 pictures of 1950 's america and pull my daisy a fictional film about the beat generation is a walking contradictor he speaks then he unspeaks he takes pictures then sometimes years later he scratches words into their surfaces drills holes through them or hangs them on a clothesline like wet socks and rephotographs them the macdowell colony here has given mr frank 77 this year 's edward macdowell medal for his outstanding contribution to photography thus has this consummate outsider been pulled inside a small circle of writers artists architects and composers who have won the medal in past years including philip roth ellsworth kelly i m pei chuck jones isamu noguchi eudora welty and aaron copland and he could n't do a thing about it frank unintentionally made himself into an exemplar or classic case when he produced the americans wrote w s di piero in the catalog for robert frank moving out a 1994 retrospective at the national gallery of art in washington in other words mr di piero wrote mr frank 's work from the 1950 's and in particular his sweetly melancholic view of america became a kind of historical shrine that was probably not how mr frank intended it he seems to have made a career of slipping his reputation finding and refinding outsider status in 1947 he moved from switzerland where he was born to the united states soon after he was hired as a fashion photographer by alexey brodovich the powerful art director of harper 's bazaar but he quickly got sick of the slickness of fashion photography and began traveling around the world peru bolivia france spain england and wales in 1954 he applied for a guggenheim fellowship to photograph america as an outsider his application said what i have in mind then is observation and record of what one naturalized american finds to see in the united states that signifies the kind of civilization born here and spreading elsewhere by the time critics finally warmed to the resulting work the americans mr frank decided he would rather be making films in 1959 he and the painter alfred leslie directed pull my daisy with a script by jack kerouac and starring the poets allen ginsberg gregory corso and peter orlovsky and the painters alice neel and larry rivers mr frank followed up in the 1960 's with the sin of jesus ok end here and me and my brother in the early 1970 's he made a photograph of strips of his movie film which he called goodbye mr brodovich i 'm leaving new york dec 23 1971 ok years after he had officially left the magazine and mr frank and his second wife the artist june leaf moved to nova scotia his photographs became more inward more autobiographical and he began scratching words into new and old pictures paradoxical desperate sounding phrases like look out for hope or hold still keep going but even in his most inward revelatory work he also appeared to be hiding my work forms a fabric with my life he once said enigmatically i can never get too far away from it the question on aug 18 was how would such a paradoxical man deal with such a straightforward event as medal day at macdowell mr frank had just flown in from switzerland and was sitting onstage with the television journalist robert macneil chairman of the board of the macdowell colony carter wiseman president cheryl young executive director david macy residential director and philip brookman a curator at the corcoran gallery in washington who has known mr frank for 20 years mr frank had dark circles under his eyes before presenting the medal mr brookman told a story about meeting mr frank for the first time in 1978 mr frank held a mirror up to mr brookman and asked do you like what you see mr brookman concluded from this that mr frank sees the camera as a mirror something that shows what he sees outside and what he feels inside mr brookman remembered that in the film me and my brother mr frank fantasized about a cameraless movie would n't it be fantastic if you did n't even have to have a piece of celluloid between you and what you saw if the eye were its own projector instead of its own camera but is mr frank really hoping for less distance between himself and the world if you listen to him speak in his german accented paradox laden english you have to wonder is his way of speaking a way of revealing or hiding is this his true mode of expression the way he really thinks or is it intentional his way of creating privacy and uncertainty or is this simply a foreigner still struggling a little with english as with mr frank 's friend the painter willem de kooning a master of both paint and aphorisms and a european emigre you just ca n't tell mr frank graciously accepted his award but then as if to set matters straight back pedaled furiously away from his laureled self this is like being a star he said so much has been said about me you have a pretty clear idea of who this guy is he was talking about himself in the third person did he mean that the words spoken about him were better than what he himself could have said or did he mean that it was useless for him to buck his public image he asked what am i doing here and there as if there were some other option then he went on to give proof that he is as he put it really an outsider he pointed out that he left switzerland for america in the 1940 's and in the 1970 's he left his adopted homeland for nova scotia but i do n't belong to canada he said quickly and in switzerland he said i am just a tourist then he seemed to disown all europe he said that he had just taken part in a large exhibition there it impressed me the way they spend money there he said and the disregard of the success of anything they show did he mean that the money was ill spent and that the work was no good or that europeans were willing to take a chance on something that might not succeed for a second mr frank seemed definitively to prefer the united states if i had n't left switzerland to come to america what i am i would not be he said this is a generous country he said then just as everyone was getting comfortable with his compliment he added but the passport can be changed then he softened but just for a moment i have never felt so strong what a wonderful country this is and what a price you have to pay to be an artist here they do n't give you nothing for nothing a triple negative mr frank prepared to leave the podium i do n't think that much i think about myself a lot then just as he was about to wrap up his acceptance

 every time milton m berger thinks about the first montauk jazz festival an event he and a friend dreamed up last september he says he feels anxious dr berger a psychiatrist and his friend robert marshall a manhattan psychologist who weekends on the east end hatched the idea for the benefit concert while trolling for striped bass off montauk aboard dr berger 's 21 foot powerboat my fantasy they were brainstorming about how to raise money to pay for renovations to the montauk community arts center when the idea for a jazz festival popped up the center which operates out of the former long island rail road station in montauk is home to the montauk artists association of which dr berger is a member the organization leases the former station from the railroad for 1 a year now the two men are devoting countless hours organizing the festival they 've enlisted the support of three area residents louis profera a bridgehampton dentist hy brodsky a retired public relations specialist and wallace a smith general manager of wpbx 883 fm and planned a daylong jazz jamboree that is expected to draw 350 people at 150 a ticket cablevision and wpbx have agreed to co sponsor the two day event which will begin on friday with a dinner dance this is the biggest event i have ever planned dr berger said it 's a lot of work a lot of worry and a lot of sleepless anxiety ridden hours but if all goes well we plan to make this an annual event the jamboree is scheduled to begin at 1 pm next saturday at the top of the downs at montauk downs state park and is expected to run well into the evening it is a tribute to the jazz bassist percy heath a longtime resident of montauk and president of the montauk artists association mr heath and his band the heath brothers have volunteered to headline the festival which they hope will raise 150000 to build classrooms a darkroom and lecture hall on the building 's second floor the former station 's first floor waiting area serves as an art gallery where local artists display their work chico hamilton an east hampton resident and his quintet are on the program along with the eddie locke quartet the jerry sokolov quintet the michael kanan trio and the bob berg group mr berg is a resident of springs the friday dinner and swing dance will be held at the top of the downs and will feature great neck resident ken james and his big band tickets are 200 and include admission to the jamboree planning an event of this magnitude was a lot more work than dr berger and the four volunteers who make up the committee imagined since october they 've booked the talent scouted and selected the location and drafted publicity materials including logos posters and stationery they 've lined up corporate sponsors hired caterers and designed tickets as the date for the festival got closer they raced all over the east end taping posters in store windows and hotel lobbies and running to the post office to mail off fliers and invitations they say it has been a huge effort with twice monthly meetings and countless phone calls to discuss a variety of issues at times it has even been comical mr brodsky related a story of how he went to his old rolodex to pitch the idea to reporters at one new york newspaper but when he dialed the number on his index card he learned that the organization had moved when he tried to call a national magazine he had regularly pitched he met with a similar situation but he managed to get the job done i 'm delighted to be a part of it mr heath said i will be in the company of a lot of great musicians who are friends of mine and i am grateful that they thought of making this concert a tribute to me mr heath said that he was 24 years old and fresh out of the army where he was a member of the all black tuskegee airmen when he bought his first bass and taught himself to play a year later he was in paris playing with the pianist and composer john lewis and the vibraphonist milt jackson as a member of the modern jazz quartet he went on to perform with such stars as charlie parker j j johnson dizzy gillespie miles davis john coltrane zoot sims dexter gordon sonny rollins and jackie mclean his whirlwind schedule and months on the road prompted him to take summers off and rent a lakeside house in montauk where he spent days with his wife june and nights fishing for stripers and fluke off the beaches with his three sons percy iii jason and stuart who became an east end fisherman no one knew who this black guy with the white wife and three boys in brooks brothers shorts was he said and i liked it that way now everyone in montauk recognizes mr heath who dresses casually often wearing fishing boots and a baseball cap when he heads into town to pick up the morning paper in 1993 he and his wife sold their home in springfield gardens queens and bought their dream house just up the hill from the one the family once rented in montauk that same year he helped found the montauk artists association at the suggestion of the artist joe bucci to promote art appreciation on the east end the organization got a lift in 1999 when it won a grant from the new york state council on the arts to offer weekly workshops for children in montauk it has also secured a grant from the town of east hampton to begin doing some initial renovations to the nearly century old station house which has its old ticket window and original mahogany benches previous fundraising efforts have enabled the association to undertake small projects like basic electrical repairs and painting but members said that in order to serve the community better they need to update and improve the second floor we 've done other fundraising efforts in the past but this is the big one dr berger said this time we are going all the way the montauk jazz festival is scheduled for 8 pm friday and 1 pm saturday at montauk downs state park information 631 668 5336
 in his first address to the city council today mayor michael r bloomberg plans to call for dissolving local school boards in favor of mayoral control of the board of education and will propose several economic development projects for the city many of them outside lower manhattan his aides say the mayor who in his inaugural address called for elected officials and city agencies to follow his lead in cutting back their staffs and budgets will begin to outline how he is trimming 20 percent from the mayor 's office said people with knowledge of the speech he will also talk about other areas of government where he believes spending has gotten out of control one area apparently is tort claims mr bloomberg will hit upon broad themes of accountability discipline and optimism said his communications director william cunningham the point will be that the city is resilient and strong and back mr cunningham said he will talk about partnerships with the city council and the legislature he will talk about private public partnerships and long term projects among the projects that mr bloomberg is expected to allude to are economic development plans in lower and upper manhattan on randalls island and in boroughs besides manhattan mr bloomberg will also revisit a pet project he has envisioned a 311 telephone system that citizens could call with nonemergency concerns and be transferred to the appropriate city agency he wants to make government more user friendly for the citizenry mr cunningham said mr bloomberg has often talked about using technology to streamline and cheapen government functions mr bloomberg who in his inaugural address called for sacrifice in the face of a roughly 4 billion anticipated budget gap will continue to urge government to scale back while keeping its sights on things like the development of manhattan 's west side and the need to attract more conventions to the city but the mayor will probably save his strongest words for the subject of education an area he has zeroed in on from the moment he took office mr bloomberg has already made his case to legislators that he would like to see the board of education put under his control a goal the governor supports the legislature which must approve such a move has been open if guarded to his gestures
 on the golf course this year paul willey was virtually unstoppable in november with thousands of golf fans from around the world glued to their screens willey put the finishing touches on a historic season defeating mike schuetz in a hawaiian tournament that earned him a cool 100000 a 37 year old military veteran from palmyra me willey won 40 of 50 tournaments he took part in this year and 47 of 71 tournaments last year during his spectacular run willey has become a celebrity far beyond the links of his small town in some golf circles people are even chatting about willey in the same sentence as tiger woods after all while woods has been filling the competition green with envy and his pockets green with cash willey has been playing out of this world it 's an honor to be compared to tiger willey said i guess the one thing that the two of us have in common is the determination to win tiger and i do not like finishing second but there are a few things that tiger woods and paul willey do not have in common willey has multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair and while woods swings a golf club to fuel his passion willey clicks on a computer mouse to fuel his champions of cyberspace like willey are slowly creeping onto the sports landscape when willey captured microsoft 's 100000 virtual golf association championship taking home the largest purse awarded for an online tournament he made national headlines not only had willey outdueled more than 12000 online competitors to earn a trip to hawaii to compete in the finals he had also done it without getting a single blister the whole thing has kind of been like a dream said willey who was handed his hefty paycheck by the former san francisco 49ers quarterback joe montana i still kind of do n't believe i won it all willey was born into a family of golf enthusiasts both of his parents golf and his sister thea davis is a local teaching pro willey has been ranked no 1 in the virtual world since he started playing pc golf as it is known in 1996 a year after retiring from military duty because of his multiple sclerosis i started spending more time on the computer willey said then one day i discovered a competitive golf site looked at the leader boards and told my wife 'i could beat those scores four years later willey a father of two has become the tiger woods of cyberspace where he is shooting in the low 50 's willey said he had been approached by one company to endorse its merchandise he is seriously thinking about hiring an agent to help place him in high profile big money tournaments and to help him make the most of his market value it sounds crazy willey said but the time is fast approaching when certain cyberathletes can actually make a living playing sports on a computer while agents like scott boras are not about to put clients like alex rodriguez on hold to talk to champs like willey anytime soon the increasing popularity of computer games is in fact setting the stage for gaming officials to create more tournaments in other sports with large prize money attached in this new cyberage that is now dawning there are definitely cyberathletes that have just as great hand eye coordination and mind body coordination as our traditional athletes said walter day president of twin galaxies which is considered an online authority on player rankings scoring and record keeping day said more contests would probably be held in the coming year and that his company would name video game champions for several sports willey said it would benefit the michael jordan of cyberspace to log a few minutes on a real basketball court and for the virtual version of mike tyson to know his way around an actual boxing ring i 'm a much better online golfer because i play the real game once in a while and the skills i take from the virtual game i 'm able to apply on a real golf course said willey who shoots in the high 90 's on a real course when i 'm online and i 'm swinging a club i have a better feel for the flight of the ball and how it 's going to act when it lands on the greens and when i 'm playing real golf i have a better idea at how to handle my trouble shots last year i was on a course and my ball was under a few trees 80 yards from the greens i stopped for a moment and thought to myself 'online i would just take a 4 iron put the ball back in my stance and punch it out of there so i did it and the ball landed on the green about 10 feet from the cup willey and day agree that a scenario in which children will one day participate in football or baseball practice by coming home from school and simply turning on their computers is more likely to take place in a galaxy far far away but both insist that cyberathletes being able to earn money without taking an elbow under a basket without being spiked at second base or checked hard into the boards are the wave of the near future i 'm all for kids getting out and playing ball in the sun but hey if you want to be great at anything including cybersports you have to put in the practice time day said and i predict that one day very soon we will see more great champions like paul willey
