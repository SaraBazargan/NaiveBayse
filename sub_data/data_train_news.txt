the sign in front of the steepled church read sunday sermon does god prefer particular sports teams a man passing by gives the sign a befuddled look the scene is in fact a cartoon in the current new yorker but the question is a good one since it has more or less been in the news the guy checking out the sign might very well have been aware of the strange one hesitates to say celestial sports goings on in new york and chicago in recent weeks in fact supernatural and miracle win were among the encomiums not infrequently used regarding certain yankee postseason triumphs the same has been true for the bears in three of the bears last four games they have won in stunning fashion on sunday they were leading 27 24 near the end when tampa bay 's 49 yard field goal attempt hit the right upright bears win earlier the bears won two straight against san francisco and cleveland by rallying to tie the game in the fourth quarter and win it in overtime against the 49ers mike brown intercepted a pass in overtime and ran it in for the victory against cleveland same guy did it again why the bears atop the their division with a 7 2 mark why now we 've gotten some breaks said the head coach dick jauron who was 11 21 in his first two seasons there 's no doubt the ball 's bounced our way more than it has the last two seasons hmm yes now no one is quite sure what reason might be behind a greater power looking especially kindly on chicago and the bears new york however was a different story after the tragic events on sept 11 it was said that the yankees spectacular grit raised the city 's spirit it began with the yankees coming back from two games down against oakland in the division series with a phenomenal play by derek jeter but one the yankees actually practiced saving the yankees from what might have been a series ending loss the yankees stormed back to win the next two games and the series and as a reminder to those fans who happened to be standing in line on broadway for cancellations for the producers and missed all the action the yankees down by two games to one to arizona in the world series won two straight games in suspiciously similar fashion trailing with two outs in the ninth inning of game 4 the yankees tied the score on a two run homer and another homer in the 10th won it in game 5 same thing behind with two outs in the ninth and a two run homer tied the game the yankees then won it in the 12th the yankees alas lost the series to essentially a better diamondbacks team but the free agent period in which players could begin signing yesterday reminds us that miracles have had less to do with the yankee success in recent years than with their good free agent picks mike mussina and david wells for two and good trades such as those for roger clemens tino martinez and scott brosius as well as a farm system that produced the likes of jeter andy pettitte and bernie williams the arizona miracles rested primarily in the left and right arms of randy johnson and curt schilling the bears like the yankees have added important free agents this season signing ted washington at 380 pounds and keith traylor at 340 to erect a virtual wall on the defensive line their top two draft picks running back anthony thomas and receiver david terrell have each had substantial impact and some of our other players are maturing and the players absolutely do n't give up said bill mcgrane director of administration for the bears what about deific intervention there 's an old russian proverb he said it goes 'pray devoutly hammer stoutly religion has often played a part in sports including pregame prayers the rev edward a malloy president of notre dame said if both sides are praying who is god paying attention to it 's like it has more to do with our sense of preparation and dependency rather than legitimately expecting god is going to favor one side over the other bernardo harris a packer linebacker had said it another way before his team 's game against the bears two weeks ago he said he could n't be bothered with talk about the bears being a miracle team we 're worried about hitting people in the mouth making big plays and winning games he said the packers then performed a miracle of their own they beat the bears suddenly and stunningly earthly

 to the editor regarding the article last sunday about the dobbs ferry village government 's barring nonresidents from parking at its metro north station commuter parking is a problem not only in ardsley and dobbs ferry but in most of westchester county i believe that this parking problem highlights the need for governments to require developers to submit transportation impact statements when proposing to build condominiums co ops or other housing the transportation impact statement should include provisions for shuttle bus or van service from the housing complex to a train or bus station if every new complex would offer residents transportation to a train or bus station we could avoid creating additional traffic congestion and metro north parking problems paul feiner town supervisor greenburgh

 the national football league is pondering meeting with two lawyers who seek increases in head coaching opportunities for african americans the nfl received a letter from the lawyers late thursday night the letter was addressed to the commissioner but he was out of town a league official requesting anonymity said it is being reviewed we will respond sometime next week and it is possible that if the commissioner does not meet with them he will appoint someone in the league office to do so it could be the first step to avoid litigation on a sensitive and explosive issue for african american coaches the league 's management and its owners and players the lawyers johnnie cochran and cyrus mehri released a report last week called black coaches in the nfl superior performance inferior opportunities the report was developed by the labor economist janice madden from the university of pennsylvania and is supported by richard lapchick the race and sports authority and floyd keith executive director of the black coaches association among numerous findings the report said that african americans in the nfl were the last hired as head coaches and the first fired and that too few of them were involved in the interview process greg aiello the nfl 's vice president for public relations said the league had developed creative ways to address these issues realized their importance and welcomed constructive dialogue cochran said these numbers showed the need for substantive change before the nfl 's next head coaching hiring cycle which usually begins in january since 1920 the league has hired more than 400 head coaches and 6 of them 15 percent have been african american of the last 22 head coaching hires 2 have been african american and though african american players compose nearly 70 percent of the league the coordinators jobs are 72 percent white and 28 percent african american and the head coaching jobs are 94 percent white compared with 6 percent african american the league currently has 32 teams and two black head coaches cochran and mehri said they were not interested in quotas but specifically in the league 's interviewing more african americans for these vacancies they want commissioner paul tagliabue to use draft picks as a reward or penalty not only to provide incentive for owners to interview and hire more african american head coaches but also to diversify club front offices with more members of minority groups including women and hispanics aiello said that in the last five years nfl teams had interviewed 15 african americans for head coaching jobs a total of 23 times and 3 became head coaches they need a game plan for change because what they are doing is not working cochran said in the last three years it has gone backward not forward some of these owners have exhibited a mentality that they are not going to change unless you have a carrot stick concept tie this issue into draft picks and you will see results aiello said the league believed that because more african american assistant coaches are in the league than ever from that pool african american head coaches will emerge in 1980 he said the league had 14 black coaches in 1997 it had 103 with 5 of them coordinators and 3 of them head coaches it now has 154 and 12 are coordinators he said that from the league 's minority coaching internship program conducted during training camp 50 participants now have jobs as nfl coaches and one herman edwards is a head coach with the jets mehri said that the way the nfl states its position on the issue sounds similar to that of texaco and coca cola corporations against whom mehri won major race discrimination suits totaling nearly 368 million the nfl has been struggling with this issue regarding african american coaches over the years mehri said i 've been fighting for african americans in the corporate ranks where they have to fight hard to go half as far as their white counterparts when you see a denny green fired after the record he has built and then not get a new job or marvin lewis coach the best defense ever win a super bowl and two years later not have a head job you know that something is wrong the nfl is part of the epicenter of this country when kids today see so few african american head coaches what does that tell them the fans are being cheated a lot of african american coaches are better qualified than some of the people currently holding the job and our data shows that in a league where 70 percent of the players are african american someday those players are going to retire what does that mean to them when an option important to many of them is shut down you 've got one african american general manager in this league ozzie newsome in baltimore let 's empower the commissioner and create change or let the courts decide mehri said first mehri and cochran would like to help the league develop a plan that works otherwise apparently a suit will be filed in federal court in new york the nfl is not above the law mehri said but there is some arrogance there art modell the baltimore ravens owner said that if he listened to cochran he 'd have o j simpson coaching my team modell added we have a system in this league and color is not a factor this is such a competitive business and we want to get the one guy coaching our teams who can turn the juice on regardless of his color and i have a question since allie sherman coached the giants in the 60 's why have n't there been any jewish head coaches in the league what 's the difference this is like the middle linebackers the centers the coordinators and the quarterbacks in our league there are more african americans in those positions now and the wall has been brought down there are n't many african american coaches in the colleges right now but we 've had some growth in the numbers of our assistant coaches and coordinators it 's coming if it goes to court they 'll lose cochran responded why should these coaches have to wait why is it that a guy like sherman lewis experienced and successful sees one of the guys that used to report to him on the minnesota staff mike tice get a head coaching job in minnesota before he does there is a major glass ceiling and we want to negotiate a plan that creates constructive change before we litigate but we are prepared to litigate and we have the stamina resources and commitment to see this through
 though the number of tuberculosis cases in the united states has fallen to an all time low a panel of experts called yesterday for renewed efforts to prevent the disease including screening immigrants for the dormant form of tb and tripling the financing for tuberculosis research there were just 17528 cases of active tuberculosis disease reported in the united states last year down from 18361 cases in 1998 and fully a third less than the recent peak of 26673 set in 1992 still according to a report from the institute of medicine of the national academies because tuberculosis remains widespread in many parts of the world the current decline in the united states could easily reverse us policy makers can not afford to relax their vigilance morton n swartz a professor at harvard medical school said dr swartz the chairman of the committee that wrote the report added that current efforts at tb control will not be sufficient and doing less could be disastrous the committee warned against a replay of the 1970 's when declining tb rates led to a dismantling of prevention and treatment programs a decade later in the late 1980 's tb infection rates rose again with drug resistant strains emerging part of the difficulty in eradicating tuberculosis is that the airborne bacteria that cause it can lie inactive in a person 's lungs for years with the host entirely unaware of the infection an estimated 90 percent of people infected by the bacteria never develop the active form of the disease which can cause a persistent cough chest pain fatigue and fever the report urges new efforts at detecting latent tuberculosis infections particularly among immigrants though immigrants account for only 10 percent of the united states population they constitute about 40 percent of active tuberculosis cases it recommended that immigrants from countries with high incidence of the disease mostly in asia and africa be screened for latent tuberculosis infections those who tested positive would still be allowed to enter the united states but would have to undergo evaluation and antibiotic therapy before they could get a permanent residency card the study was financed by the federal centers for disease control and prevention the institute of medicine is a private nonprofit institution that provides advice on health policy under a congressional charter to the national academy of sciences
 seeming ever more frail pope john paul ii beatified mother teresa of calcutta on sunday as an icon of the good samaritan declaring her close to sainthood before tens of thousands of worshipers in st peter 's square the two hour ceremony said as much about the pope 's vitality though as it did about the memory of mother teresa whose image of devotion to the sick and needy has become an emblem of selflessness and piety with our apostolic authority we grant that the venerable servant of god teresa of calcutta shall from now on be called blessed the pope said in latin his voice was halting and indistinct as he pronounced mother teresa the latest of the more than 1300 people he has beatified in his 25 year tenure a huge portrait of mother teresa a nobel peace prize winner sometimes called the saint of the gutters for her work in calcutta was unfurled on the great facade of st peter 's basilica showing her smiling and deeply wrinkled her greatness lies in her ability to give without counting the cost to give 'until it hurts the pope 's homily said her life was a radical living and a bold proclamation of the gospel i am personally grateful to this brave woman who i always felt was at my side the sermon said though the words illuminated the pope 's feeling for mother teresa 's example the manner of their delivery betrayed his frailty for the first time on a major occasion the pope did not read a single line of his homily leaving it to cardinal ivan dias of bombay and others to speak for him when he said prayers in latin moreover his voice slurred to the point where his words were hard to understand senior aides also took over from him in saying mass when his voice weakened and tailed off people who have watched him closely in recent years said that the pope seemed particularly tired perhaps because he is midway through an intense series of public appearances those began with the celebrations of his quarter century as pope last thursday and are set to culminate on tuesday in the confirmation of 31 new cardinals the ceremonies on sunday blended the vatican 's solemnity with less austere moments indian women in white and gold saris bearing flowers swayed before the canopied altar on the steps of st peter 's basilica to music played on tabla and harmonium within the huge crowd said by the police to number 300000 although other estimates put the figure lower some people lauded the pope 's courage in defying the increasingly evident symptoms of parkinson 's disease others saw the remarkable spectacle of his physical decline as inspirational from his suffering and his humanity we can see his holiness said elena pelli a 19 year old italian law student in bright sunlight after a night of rain the pope was wheeled to an altar below the basilica on an upholstered chair and after the ceremony seemed to rally slightly as he was driven through the crowd in an open popemobile with few of the security trappings that usually surround figures of global stature beatification may be granted by the roman catholic church to a person who is seen as having been of overwhelming virtue whose goodness has been sustained after death and who is deemed to have interceded from beyond the grave in a miracle usually a medical cure for which there is said to be no scientific explanation once beatified the blessed and relics associated with them may be venerated the pope was presented on sunday with a piece of cloth stained with mother teresa 's blood that is to be displayed this week in a roman church for veneration beatification usually leads to sainthood once there is evidence of a second miracle mother teresa was born in 1910 in skopje now the capital of macedonia a former yugoslav republic she died in 1997 after spending most of her life in calcutta living in poverty as she ministered to the poorest and least privileged she founded her order the missionaries of charity in 1950 with 12 nuns it now has 4500 sisters in more than 130 countries like mother teresa the nuns wear the simple white saris edged in blue that were once associated with the street sweepers of calcutta from the earliest hours on sunday people began gathering in st peter 's square and along the wide via della conciliazione leading to it some brought their own sick in wheelchairs hoping for miracles others relished the sense of occasion that vatican officials are skilled at building among the crowd many waved red and black albanian flags to honor mother teresa 's origins although the claim to her memory is disputed between albanian and macedonian nationalists presidents princes dignitaries and politicians from 27 countries including the united states attended the open air ceremony the week of ecclesiastical events surrounding the beatification has been closely choreographed to ensure its impact not only do the church 's scarlet robed cardinals lend a sense of gravity and occasion but the timing of mother teresa 's beatification which drew bigger numbers than the pope 's own anniversary mass on thursday virtually assured that pilgrims would flood here from around the world this is like witnessing the faith of so many people said cathy o'donnell 48 who had traveled from stephens city va some in the crowd said they believed the pope had scheduled the events so close together because he sensed that time was running out perla godino 21 an italian art student said he is a great pope who wants to do things in his way and added he is bringing his mission to its completion pope john paul ii 's papacy has set records not only for beatifications but also for sainthoods the pope has canonized more than 470 new saints since he took office those who gathered for the ceremony dismissed suggestions by the pope 's critics that he had bent the church 's rules by permitting mother teresa 's supporters to complete the processes leading to beatification so soon after her death usually five years must elapse before the process begins but the pope waived that requirement for mother teresa and approved a miracle last year curing an indian woman of a tumor said to be cancerous that some held to be contentious she was already a saint said lucielle hoyon 56 of paris
 when senator john mccain had a routine checkup for skin cancer on july 27 a few days before the republican convention dr john f eisold the attending physician of the united states capitol spotted a mole on his patient 's left temple and told him you ought to have that checked the checkup was one of many regular exams mr mccain has undergone since he had a malignant melanoma removed from his left shoulder in 1993 the doctors had pronounced him cured of that melanoma but it is too soon to know how serious the new one on his temple will be after the recent checkup mr mccain moved swiftly on aug 1 after speaking at the convention in philadelphia the senator took the train to washington two days later he went to bethesda naval medical center in maryland where doctors detected another suspicious mole on his left upper arm and performed a biopsy on each mole that evening mr mccain returned to the convention and wore a bandage over part of his left temple when he appeared on stage with gov george w bush the republican presidential nominee a week later on aug 10 mr mccain learned in a call from bethesda that the moles were new malignant melanomas mr mccain who later said he was surprised by the diagnosis then arranged to have a second opinion and additional tests performed through dr john d eckstein his personal physician at the mayo clinic here on saturday mr mccain had a five and a half hour operation to remove the two melanomas and lymph nodes in his head and neck today as mr mccain 63 recovers at the mayo clinic hospital here he is awaiting a determination by pathologists on whether the temple melanoma has spread preliminary tests before and during surgery indicated that the cancer was confined to the skin his doctors said the quickness with which mr mccain and his doctors reacted in the last three weeks contrasts sharply with a similar situation in 1993 at that time it took more than six months before mr mccain sought care after a navy doctor recommended that he consult a dermatologist for what turned out to be his first melanoma the one removed from his left shoulder mr mccain 's experience with the more than six month delay in 1993 led him to act much faster this time and the episode in 1993 underlies the senator 's repeated urging that other people get checked for skin cancer for instance mr mccain stood in front of his home on friday after undergoing tests at the hospital to emphasize the benefits of detecting melanomas and other cancers at an early stage when they are most curable the delay in 1993 was documented in the hundreds of pages of medical records mr mccain released during the presidential primary campaign and was verified in interviews with his doctors the records included the annual checkups that mr mccain underwent as a volunteer in the program for all former prisoners of war that the military conducts in pensacola fla the pensacola doctors spotted a dark irregularly shaped area of skin on mr mccain 's left shoulder during a checkup on may 7 1993 but the records show they did not suspect a melanoma a letter from a navy doctor dated june 8 1993 recommended that mr mccain consult a dermatologist for what the pensacola doctors said they thought was a noncancerous condition actinic keratosis which results from chronic sun exposure it was not until nov 24 1993 that mr mccain sought care for the skin condition he went to dr thomas m hudak a plastic surgeon in phoenix who had treated mr mccain 's wife cindy dr hudak said in an earlier interview that though the dark area on the skin was not an obvious melanoma he suspected it was a cancer after years of seeing many lesions like this it just sort of caught my eye dr hudak said the melanoma had escaped the eye of dr eckstein mr mccain 's personal physician who said in an interview that he did n't recognize it if it was there when he examined mr mccain in 1992 undoubtedly it was there dr eckstein said the reasons for the delay in 1993 are not clear now said nancy ives mr mccain 's press secretary but ms ives said that mr mccain might have put off seeking medical care in part because of a heavy speaking schedule on behalf of other republicans because individuals with one melanoma can develop more they are advised to have periodic checkups dr hudak said he had removed several noncancerous moles from mr mccain 's skin including one from his left temple on oct 4 1998 it was a type known as a pigmented junctional nevus mr mccain recalled on friday that the new melanoma appeared near the spot where the benign mole had been melanomas can occasionally go undetected in a biopsy for many reasons one is misdiagnosis a second reason is disagreement among pathologists in interpreting what they see through a microscope if you send slides of a suspected melanoma to a dozen dermatologists some will call it normal and some will read it as a melanoma said dr bernard s goffe a dermatologist in seattle that 's a well known fact a third reason is that pathologists do not examine every millimeter of the tissue removed in a biopsy they take representative sections from different areas thus a melanoma that is confined to a small area of a mole may escape examination as a result of sampling errors when a new melanoma is detected in an area where a mole was removed and diagnosed as benign doctors usually review the microscopic slides to determine if the melanoma was present but missed in the initial testing dr eckstein said on saturday that no evidence of a melanoma had been detected in such a review of the mole that was removed from mr mccain in 1998 even early detection of melanomas is not foolproof because such cancers can be quirky recurring suddenly and unexpectedly decades after they are first detected yet when such metastases have occurred many people have gone on for years without further medical problems and sometimes a melanoma can first develop in the bowel or brain without ever having appeared on the skin scientists do not know why melanomas can behave so peculiarly

 players used to chase the dollar now they chase a championship ring this is one trend i hope catches on winning really does matter we talk about athletes and their pursuit of money and the criticism is often true but many athletes have discovered as they grow older that legacy assumes a greater importance in their lives there is no greater legacy in competitive sports than winning that 's why games are played and scores are recorded karl malone and gary payton took pay cuts to join the los angeles lakers with the hope of realizing their dreams of winning an nba championship we always focus on the negative with pro athletes grant hill of the orlando magic said friday night here 's an example of two guys who are about winning this says a lot about their character and priorities this says

jumping ship and going with an offer from a championship caliber team hill speaking from his home in orlando fla has watched the various comings and goings of his colleagues as he has come to grips with his own athletic mortality an ankle injury that he sustained while he was with the detroit pistons and that he aggravated in orlando has led to a series of operations that threaten his career a career that had been untouched by misfortune has taken a precarious turn as you get older your priorities change hill said most athletes as they get older have a sense of desperation they know that the end is near they had a great run made a lot of money now it 's about winning that 's why i 'm not surprised by what gary payton and karl malone did they 've always been about winning malone will

season if you ca n't beat 'em join 'em payton and malone are the latest in a line of nba players whose path to a championship has been blocked in their case by one player michael jordan was a granite barrier for malone and for payton as well as for charles barkley and for patrick ewing barkley left the philadelphia 76ers for the phoenix suns in pursuit of a ring in 1993 barkley 's suns lost to jordan 's bulls in the nba finals in 1993 chicago defeated ewing 's knicks in the eastern conference finals in 1994 while jordan was playing baseball the knicks beat the bulls in the conference semifinals and eventually reached the nba finals losing to houston jordan returned late in the 1994 95 season but it was the pacers and not the bulls who beat the knicks in the conference semifinals malone reached the nba finals twice in 1997 and 1998 both times the jazz lost to jordan 's bulls payton was with seattle in 1996 when the sonics lost to chicago in the finals i remember talking with payton at the olympics hill recalled of the 1996 atlanta games they 'd lost to the bulls but they had the same team coming back you could expect them to be in the finals it did n't work out that way a year later seattle failed to go beyond the second round here 's a warning do n't be so quick to crown the lakers as kings you ca n't predict the future hill said i learned that with my ankle anything can happen hill left the pistons in 2000 for orlando he was n't being desperate he was being pragmatic tracy mcgrady was joining the magic that same year after three seasons in toronto the magic was going after tim duncan full force hill would complete the picture duncan remained in san antonio mcgrady blossomed into a star but hill has missed most of three seasons with the ankle injury who could have seen that then that 's the point of course who can anticipate this i was 27 years old at the time hill said i was looking forward to playing with duncan or tracy mcgrady i wanted to be part of helping a franchise get there i felt i had the majority of my career ahead of me now hill now considers himself desperate he comes off crutches wednesday and will put all his weight on the ankle for the first time in a year the quest begins in the last three years i guess you can say i 've developed a sense of urgency hill said i definitely have this same sense of desperation i 'm the oldest player on the roster i was always used to being the youngest now i 'm the oldest i know that when i get back on the court whenever that is this is going to be it you compete to achieve the ultimate and that 's a championship you never know how to figure these things the lakers tried the three star approach in july 1968 when they traded for wilt chamberlain and put him on a team with jerry west who was 30 and elgin baylor who was 34 the three superstars failed to win a championship together then baylor who had been a 10 time all star retired nine games into the 1971 72 season and the lakers went on to win the championship winning as hill knows is capricious in his first two seasons at duke university hill won consecutive national championships he thought that was the way of the world well that was 10 11 years ago he said i want to get back and taste that feeling i want to win everyone does and nearly every player in the history of sports has talked about wanting a championship ring the difference between yesterday and today is that players can afford the luxury of pursuing one
 when manager joe torre reached the mound in the bottom of the seventh inning tonight he clapped his hands before taking the ball from jose contreras it seemed to be an empty gesture because there was little for contreras to celebrate after a month away from the yankees he had failed miserably in his return contreras 's december signing touched off a feud between the yankees principal owner george steinbrenner and the red sox president larry lucchino who both bid for contreras after he defected from cuba when contreras struggled early and was sent to tampa instead of class aaa columbus torre quarreled with steinbrenner the question now is what was all the fuss about contreras got out of a jam tonight but created another and the yankees have still gotten nothing from their four year 32 million investment in him contreras threw fastballs reaching 95 miles an hour but he allowed five runs and got only four outs blowing the lead in the seventh inning of a 10 7 loss to the boston red sox pedro martinez missed his start because of a strained muscle below his right shoulder blade but the red sox won anyway feasting on contreras and jeff weaver after the game torre was still stressing the positive praising contreras for throwing confidently after seeming so tentative in april it is a worthwhile strategy for a sensitive pitcher like contreras who admitted before the game that he put too much pressure on himself early on partly because of his contract i was very pleased torre said i thought this was more of a plus than a minus in the long run i thought his command was much better than when he left i thought his stuff was better and he seemed to be more confident in letting the ball go the yankees believe contreras can be a premier starter a notion shared by the red sox who offered him a four year 27 million deal but there is no place in the rotation unless the struggling weaver is bumped weaver has allowed 72 hits in 57 2 3 innings and opponents are batting 308 against him he gave up five runs on seven hits and four walks and did not record an out in the sixth it 's been back and forth pretty much the whole start of the season weaver said way too many walks i 'm not a guy who picks corners i go right after guys mechanically i feel good at times and for some reason i might lose it weaver will have time to smooth his mechanics torre said it would be unfair to consider pulling him from the rotation even with contreras back no not now torre said jeff weaver is an established starter of course contreras is also but i think we 'd like to go a little bit longer and see what happens we 're all pitching for a spot all the starters we have to compete every day it 's nothing new i do n't think we 're trying to apply that kind of pressure there 's enough pressure in this game without threatening people the game had started with such promise for the yankees martinez 's replacement bruce chen gave up a homer to alfonso soriano on the first pitch of the game the yankees scored again in the inning and held a 3 1 lead after two but boston steadily hammered weaver who kept leaving pitches up in the strike zone the red sox had five extra base hits off him the last a two run homer by jason varitek that gave them a 4 3 lead after four the former yankee ramiro mendoza relieved chen and gave up four consecutive singles allowing the yankees to go ahead when weaver left in the sixth the yankees had a 6 5 lead with two runners on and no one out contreras got a double play grounder and a strikeout ending the inning torre believed he had found a solution to the yankees setup relief problems i had visions of him taking us right to mo torre said referring to closer mariano rivera i was very confident with him going out there for the next inning contreras who said his mechanics were a total disaster in april started the seventh working from the stretch which had felt comfortable in the sixth but he walked the leadoff man todd walker i tried to overprotect that one run lead contreras said through an interpreter i should have just gone right after him and attacked him contreras jammed the next hitter nomar garciaparra with a splitter but garciaparra blooped a double to left off the end of his bat and an intentional walk to manny ramirez loaded the bases contreras tried to throw david ortiz a fastball off the plate but he missed his spot and ortiz bashed a two run double to the warning track in deep left center the red sox led 7 6 and continued to pile on i faced contreras once in spring training and all he was throwing was off speed pitches ortiz said i saw him tonight throwing a lot of fastballs i guess they 've been working on that i guess somebody told him that the big league club is different from whatever he played before he 's got a good fastball he 's got to use it that was contreras 's plan and catcher jorge posada was pleased to see him execute it i thought he was more aggressive posada said his stuff was better and he came after hitters it 's just a matter of time to put it all together that time was not tonight contreras has a 1563 earned run average and no answers for his struggles he pitched well in the minors tightened his mechanics restored his confidence he is still waiting for results

 kmart which began presenting its reorganization strategy before a federal judge in chicago yesterday said that the majority of its creditors had approved its plan to emerge from bankruptcy but the company which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in january 2002 could face fierce opposition from a small group of creditors before the hearing began yesterday those creditors filed about 175 objections to the company 's plan and how they would be reimbursed kmart said it considered this opposition to be immaterial but the retailer will still have to contend with disenchanted firms like capital factors inc a creditor whose lawyers filed an emergency motion to delay the hearing yesterday the proceedings which are taking place in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois are expected to last at least two days but the hearing could easily stretch into tomorrow people close to the case said if kmart 's plan is approved by the court the company could come out of chapter 11 in as little as 10 days kmart has said that it plans to leave bankruptcy protection by april 30 and return to profitability by 2004 under its reorganization plan kmart will receive about 300 million from two investors edward s lampert and martin j whitman who are known for putting money into companies they consider undervalued the men will also control four of the nine seats on the company 's board kmart is already trying to reposition itself in the marketplace the company is closing a total of 599 stores and trimming its work force by 57000 it will still have 1500 stores when it emerges from bankruptcy kmart is also trying to attract customers by offering a variety of incentives kmart filed for bankruptcy after a series of missteps including the initiation of a price war with wal mart concerns reached an apex in late january 2002 when some kmart suppliers feared that the company would not be able to pay for goods it had ordered and stopped shipping products to the retailer but kmart 's troubles date back much further in the last two decades kmart has struggled to maintain its customer base the chain has lost ground because of increased competition from wal mart which has a grip on cost conscious suburbanites and from target which appeals to hip trendy shoppers who are more fashion conscious shortly after kmart filed for bankruptcy charges of accounting irregularities surfaced at the company the economy worsened and martha stewart the personality behind one of kmart 's best selling product lines came under scrutiny by the securities and exchange commission for her stock trades some analysts said that kmart perhaps because of pressure from its lenders was seeking to come out of bankruptcy protection too quickly they have n't articulated a strategy said walter k levy the managing director for retail trends and positioning at kurt salmon associates all they 've done is have a series of tactics they still have n't defined why the customer should shop there rather than wal mart or target that really is the bottom line the company has also been criticized for hiring inexperienced chief merchandising and chief store operations officers that 's one of the reasons their same store sales continue to trend downward said burt flickinger iii a managing partner of the strategic resource group target and wal mart have at least stabilized during this recession as kmart works to shed its chapter 11 status soon it faces a tough marketplace in which retailers have recorded disappointing sales and consumers concerned about the war and the weak economy have been spending less given the challenges ahead some analysts suggested a worst case situation in which kmart could stumble badly and wind up back in bankruptcy in a few years companies that have slipped back into bankruptcy include montgomery ward which declared bankruptcy in 1997 and again in 2000 and bradlees which came out of bankruptcy protection in 1999 and re entered in 2000 both companies ultimately went out of business

 one oddity of election night 2000 some would call it a relief was that the four men who battered our eardrums in their quests for the presidency and vice presidency fell abruptly silent not a creature was stirring or accepting or conceding not even joe lieberman oops even this is not quite true a few connecticut ears did hear mr lieberman 's voice around 9 20 pm broadcast on speakers at the goodwin hotel in hartford where democrats had gathered to await the returns mr lieberman 's senior senate colleague united states senator christopher dodd ascended the podium and on the strength of the false florida projection incited not exactly a victory celebration but at least a sack dance then mr dodd announced a special treat over the speakers came mr lieberman 's voice advising as had mr dodd that nothing was settled but agreeing that things were looking awfully good thanking all concerned etc did n't do it alone etc so much love etc he were calling from what is known as a hold which is where they keep you if you 're so important that you have to be ushered out on stage at a certain time and too important to be seen loitering casually in the vicinity beforehand the hold is an apt metaphor for that very trying night in mr lieberman 's life for the days that followed it for the next four years of his career and for the fortunes of other connecticut figures whose futures hinged in great measure on the activities of clerks in obscure florida counties in year 2000 connecticut politics limbo has been the look of the season with the presidential election mess not quite resolved at the time of this writing there are more questions than there are answers but certain issues are inescapable mr lieberman 's national standing by most reckonings if the gore ticket loses mr lieberman is an automatic front runner in the 2004 democratic presidential hunt after all mr gore was at least 14 points down when he tapped mr lieberman and pulled up to parity and even the most merciless who lost florida analysis would have to concede that sans mr lieberman it would have easily been george w bush 's state on the other hand mr lieberman 's political style his cultural conservatism his chummy debate performance with opposite number dick cheney his fondness for public displays of religiosity may have worked better for a democratic second banana than it will for a top dog and the national press shows signs that its romance with mr lieberman is fading a little by the end of sunday oct 29 after making the rounds of the morning talk shows mr lieberman had taken some tough questions revealing that he might have voted to confirm robert bork as supreme court justice if he 'd been in the senate at the time and that although he supports abortion choice he would oppose it for his wife or daughters if gore loses says one party insider there 's going to be a lot of soul searching about what the party should be in 2004 mr lieberman 's mix of conservatism and piety may not be palatable to the larger democratic party he 'd have to change again says the democratic source mr lieberman in the state his performance during the summer and fall suggested that mr lieberman 's role in connecticut politics as vice president would closely parallel prince charles 's role in great britain largely symbolic and clouded with mixed feelings while running with mr gore mr lieberman evinced cheerful but limited interest in connecticut affairs including his own senate campaign he raised at least 25 million more than he needed to defeat the surmountable waterbury mayor phil giordano and if he had any thoughts of using the overage to help embattled state candidates these seem not to have been translated into action there has been low level grumbling among party insiders about this but then the party picked up seats in the state house and senate and had in general a very sunny election day save for the demise of united states representative sam gejdenson the phrase lieberman coattails is now spoken much more loudly than where was he in state polls indicate that the voters regard mr lieberman as a beloved if slightly prodigal son they disapproved of his dual candidacy but emphatically forgave him for it mr lieberman and mr dodd connecticut 's two senators maintain a cheery show of support and affability but a certain edginess underlies it mr dodd the senior senator has played the good sport but he has no stomach for living in mr lieberman 's shadow there are some early signs that the two men will begin carving out different roles with mr dodd taking the more active role in shaping the democratic political future in connecticut and mr lieberman seeking the washington limelight when mr dodd ascended the stage at the goodwin tuesday night he made a point of introducing two people who had worked behind the scenes the first was john olson head of the state afl cio the second was edward marcus the state party chairman mr olson had been moving around the state for months lining up votes for a challenge to mr marcus mr dodd who has opposed mr marcus in the past appeared to be making a point by introducing his rival first mr marcus in his remarks to the crowd noted that mr lieberman was going to be elected to the senate that night by the biggest margin in connecticut history eclipsing the record of chris dodd it was a needle pinking mr dodd in the raw wound of his new status as the second biggest gorilla in the connecticut senate delegation the next four years of connecticut democratic party life will play out like installments of i claudius who will win the olson marcus battle if there is one when it comes time to redistrict next year and the state loses a congressional seat will the democratic majority in the general assembly avenge mr gejdenson by eliminating the second district how will the ambitions of attorney general richard blumenthal united states representative rosa delauro the former gubernatorial candidate william curry bridgeport mayor joseph ganim secretary of state susan bysiewicz comptroller nancy wyman senate majory leader george jepsen and perhaps even the attorney ted kennedy jr be squeezed through that funnel where the prize seekers at the beginning far exceed prizes at the end in the spirit of i claudius and for that matter life in the hold many of these questions are interlinked ms bysiewicz might like to run for mr gejdenson 's old seat in 2002 but ca n't if it 's gone mr ganim has gubernatorial aspirations but would be hurt if his ally mr marcus is deposed mr blumenthal is the presumptive nominee for the next open senate seat but mr lieberman seems intrigued by ms delauro especially because her husband pollster stanley greenberg is a gore lieberman consiglieri a lot of this energy is dammed up behind the logjam of mr lieberman 's complex situation and one thing we know about logjams is that when they break the water and wood start moving very fast election memo colin mcenroe is a radio talk show host in hartford

 oops the yankees celebrated too soon on orders from george m steinbrenner the team wanted not to have the major leagues highest opening day payroll and on sunday thought they had achieved their quest when it appeared that the boston red sox were no 1 but yesterday a recalculation based on the present day value of manny ramirez 's contract lowered the red sox total and bumped the yankees into their customary top spot the yankees payroll made up of 25 players on the roster and 6 players on the disabled list is 109801893 boston 's payroll with 25 active and 7 disabled players had been computed at 111505833 including 15 million for ramirez a 13 million salary and a 2 million share of his 16 million signing bonus however when the players association and the labor relations department of major league baseball determine their opening day payrolls the red sox figure will be about 2 million less because part of ramirez 's salary and signing bonus will be deferred without interest the players association reduces the 2001 value to 12932275 while baseball lowers it to 13033075 either figure drops the red sox to approximately 1095 million or 300000 below the yankees murray chass

 when two fancy and entertaining offenses are featured in a high wire football act the difference in the game often is the defense that clips the wire sending the opponent 's offense tumbling into mistakes and mediocrity the denver defense brought its shears today against st louis the broncos beat the rams 23 16 in a game that was supposed to be a firecracker but dissolved into sporadic sparks yet the game was full of crafty plays and colored by big and punishing hits for the 75710 fans at invesco field at mile high stadium the joy was supplied by the broncos who had the better licks all day long denver limited st louis to 32 rushing yards only 1 yard in the first half running back marshall faulk gained only 19 yards on 10 carries fifteen of those yards came early in the fourth quarter the broncos intercepted rams quarterback kurt warner once and also forced a turnover on a kickoff return but the most important thing they did was keep the rams out of the end zone allowing only faulk 's 3 yard scoring run early in the third quarter leading by 16 13 the broncos stopped the rams on a fourth and 1 pass at the denver 9 late in the third quarter the rams fourth quarter possessions went this way a missed 39 yard field goal attempt and a successful field goal from 39 yards in between denver scored on a 23 yard touchdown pass from quarterback brian griese to wide receiver ed mccaffrey on a drive that featured a conversion on fourth and 1 at the broncos 38 yard line the broncos employing a defense devised by the coordinator ray rhodes pressured the rams offense into a funk this game was for those who are used to getting physical broncos defensive end trevor pryce said linebacker al wilson added it was just one of those situations where you felt unstoppable i do n't care how many yards you get when you do n't score you do n't win warner threw for 315 yards but did not have his usual scoring output teams have gotten a lot of pressure on us with their front four and we have to do a better job with that warner said the rams understandably were in a foul mood they were not about to concede that denver was a better team or even a special team denver played a good game today but basically they made the plays they needed to rams cornerback aeneas williams said we 've got to get everyone playing up to full throttle and in this first game we did n't do that the broncos leaped ahead 10 0 with the rams setting up denver 's first touchdown grant winstrom roughed the punter in denver 's end zone with the penalty the broncos got the ball back and sustained their drive denver drove 97 yards in 13 plays and scored on a 7 yard touchdown pass from griese to rod smith the rams managed only two field goals in the first half and trailed by 16 6 i thought they took the fight to us pretty good in the first half rams coach mike martz said they were more physical than we were they shook us up a bit st louis started the second half with a williams interception that led to faulk 's 3 yard scoring run and st louis ended the third quarter with the ball at the denver 9 facing a fourth and 1 rather than attempt a tying field goal martz went for the jugular the broncos pressure on warner and poor route running by rams fullback chris hetherington he slipped on his release into the right flat although martz said he was pushed thwarted the play in the fourth quarter rams place kicker jeff wilkins 's failed field goal attempt set up the broncos drive that ended with a touchdown catch by mccaffrey the rams found themselves in a hole too deep to crawl out of the critical play was the fourth and 1 15 yard pitch play from griese to the rookie running back clinton portis that ended at the st louis 47 yard line i felt at that time that we could n't get anything going and they are a very explosive football team and if you give them too many chances you 're making a mistake denver coach mike shanahan said i went with a gut feeling we said 'hey let 's try to win it right here we felt we had a play that we had n't shown them in a long time and it might catch them off balance luckily it worked or i 'm sure i would be getting second guessed right now i thought we needed it and i 'm glad the players bailed me out from what could have been a bad call the rams smirked at the broncos play choice because they said it was a play they made popular in the 1999 season denver used it to kill the rams chances it was an excellent play call martz said we ran it in '99 and we kind of put it on the shelf a little bit i guess it 's coming back so are the broncos but thus far the same can not be said for the rams offense everybody may think they have a blueprint on how to beat us now but i would n't say that the rams kim herring said we just have to get back to balance and scoring and winning like on this day the broncos
 the knicks have set their sights on the 6 foot 10 inch forward joe smith whose contract with the minnesota timberwolves was voided today by the national basketball association making him a free agent he 's certainly a great player and we certainly have interest in him general manager scott layden said tonight at halftime of the washington wizards 87 86 exhibition victory over the knicks we 'll certainly see if there 's a chance to get him here the knicks are over the salary cap so they can offer smith only the midlevel exception or 225 million a year layden said approximately half of the league 's 29 clubs can make the same offer while a couple of others can offer more dan fegan smith 's agent said that the knicks would be a good fit for his client he 's still looking at his options with other teams but new york is a situation that would suit him fegan said adding that he had spoken to layden tonight smith 25 is entering his sixth season he has averaged 145 points and 75 rebounds a game the no 1 pick in the 1995 draft smith averaged only 99 points and 62 rebounds a game last season as the timberwolves sixth man still smith has great potential and could help the knicks in their area of greatest need rebounding though mainly a power forward he can also play small forward and center particularly in the small eastern conference the miami heat which lost alonzo mourning for the season because of a kidney disorder could be able to offer smith 39 million if the league awards the club a disabled player exception the heat applied for it today the chicago bulls who reportedly have an interest in smith could offer him about 6 million fegan said if smith retained his larry bird rights a provision that allows a team to re sign its own free agent after three years even if the new contract exceeds the salary cap the timberwolves would be his first choice latrell sprewell could play a role in helping the knicks sign smith the two played together at golden state in the 1995 97 seasons and were good friends if he knows we 're interested he 's going to be willing to come said sprewell who called smith tonight i 've seen him quite a bit at minnesota and he 's a very good player layden said of smith he 's matured into a fine player i think he 's improved every year he 's highly skilled yet he does things that help a team win he looks like a guy who can play a number of positions rebounds coach jeff van gundy was upset with the knicks performance wednesday we 've got a lot of things to tighten the screws on he said guys were more worried about the world series than about tonight 's game chris whitney 's 3 pointer with 24 seconds left was the decisive shot for the wizards latrell sprewell who showed up 20 minutes before tip off led the knicks 5 2 with 23 points

 what do the defenestrations of paul h o'neill the treasury secretary and lawrence b lindsey the president 's top economic adviser reveal about the economy now its future and that of the stock market about the economy now the moves show how worried president bush is that the nation will slip back into recession the economy is perceived to be a serious problem said jan hatzius senior economist at goldman sachs you would n't need to change the team if there was n't a problem nor would you change the team if you were n't worried about being re elected in 2004 clearly the white house understands that the economy needs strong medicine if it is to stay on its feet and become ambulatory that medicine administered heretofore and only somewhat successfully by alan greenspan will soon be augmented by new tax cuts if mr bush has his way neither mr o'neill nor mr lindsey had the ideas or the credibility to fix the problems so both had to go many economists agree that tax cuts are exactly what the doctor ordered largely because consumer spending the engine of economic growth in recent years is imperiled by excessive borrowing this economy is really laboring under a tremendous debt load said paul kasriel director of economic research at northern trust in chicago the corporate sector has made great strides in slowing down its borrowing but the private sector has n't even started sure enough debt as a percentage of assets among households has reached new highs consumer borrowing was very strong in the third quarter and equity extraction from homes has been enormous the household net worth figures released last week by the federal reserve showing the latest in a string of declines were also ominous prior to 2000 there had never been a year on year decline in household net worth in the postwar period mr kasriel noted it happened in 2000 and 2001 and now 2002 people are going to have to start saving more but increased saving means reduced spending which would in turn drag down the economy so tax cuts are a way to give consumers the cushion they need to save a bit even as they keep spending the problem for mr bush is that his tax cuts of whatever sort are not likely to be enough to counterbalance increased taxes that most consumers will face from their state and local governments which are struggling mightily and because spending at state and local levels is almost double that of federal spending restraint there could damage the economy significantly if you take all levels of government together it is unlikely that the federal government 's stimulus can outweigh the state and local governments restraint mr hatzius said so even if mr bush succeeds in pushing tax cuts through they may not be that effective in propelling the economy as a result mr hatzius and mr kasriel both expect the economy to sputter along next year mr hatzius projects gross domestic product growth of around 2 percent for 2003 while mr kasriel forecasts around 3 percent so where does that leave the stock market stable perhaps but not strapping sluggish gross domestic product growth usually means corporate profits are n't much better than flat mr hatzius said and if corporate profits stagnate stock indexes may too what has gone on in the past two years may well continue individual stocks do well but the indexes disappoint this economy is in hock mr kasriel said it has come off 20 years of extreme leveraging it 's going to take time to work through these things and it wo n't be pleasant
 with army at 0 5 and texas christian at 4 1 after four consecutive victories today 's game at michie stadium shaped up as a blowout army 's prospects seemed all the more bleak because the horned frogs came into the game ranked seventh in the nation in turnover margin army was 114th and seventh in rushing defense but going into the fourth quarter on a dank rainy day before a crowd of 32454 army trailed by only 5 points tcu added two more touchdowns in the last quarter to hand the black knights a 46 27 defeat army 0 4 conference usa got an offensive boost with the return of the sophomore quarterback reggie nevels who had not played since sustaining a hamstring injury in the season opener nevels connected on 8 of 17 passes for 104 yards and a touchdown and ran 15 times for a team high 65 yards while scoring one touchdown but nevels threw two interceptions one of which led to a field goal i did feel rusty at the beginning of the game nevels said recovering from a hamstring injury takes away from your conditioning and conditioning affects mental attitude nevels was overshadowed by tcu 's tye gunn a redshirt freshman quarterback who was filling in for the injured starter sean stilley gunn connected on 12 of 15 passes for 147 yards and a touchdown and scrambled 15 times for 33 yards over all we were certainly better than we were at east carolina army coach todd berry said alluding to his team 's 59 24 defeat last saturday i just wish there had been more consistency on both sides of the ball we just seem to find ways to sabotage ourselves one of those ways berry said was when punter chris castelli had to field a snap from jason frazier on a bounce in the end zone in the fourth quarter with army trailing 32 27 castelli ran the ball rather than risk a blocked punt that gave the horned frogs the ball at the army 6 and three plays later reggie holts scored from the 1 to widen tcu 's lead to 39 27 army kept the game close during the first half largely because of mistakes by texas christian 2 1 in the conference after the horned frogs took the opening kickoff and drove 67 yards for their first touchdown army recovered a fumble at its 37 and drove 63 yards to tie the score at 7 7 the touchdown a 20 yard run by the freshman running back carlton jones was army 's first in the opening quarter this season but then tcu scored on its next four possessions field goals of 31 32 and 33 yards by nick browne and a 46 yard pass from gunn to wide receiver adrian madise to go ahead by 23 7 with 4 minutes 18 seconds left in the opening half madise 's touchdown came after a 19 yard punt by castelli gave tcu possession at the army 46 browne 's third field goal his 15th in 16 attempts this season followed an interception at the army 22 army got another break with 57 seconds left in the half when the snap sailed through the hands of texas christian punter joe biasatti biasatti fell on the ball at the horned frogs 2 yard line where army took possession with 36 seconds remaining in the half two plays later nevels flashed through right tackle for his first career touchdown paul stelzer 's conversion attempt was blocked but army had cut the deficit to 23 13 another texas christian miscue led to army 's third touchdown early in the third period army 's mario price recovered a fumbled punt at the texas christian 40 marcellus chapman capped the ensuing scoring drive by scoring from 3 yards to make it 23 20 texas christian increased its lead to 5 points when zac dahman the backup army quarterback was called for intentional grounding in the end zone resulting in a safety after the free kick lonta hobbs banged in from 3 yards out to cap a 31 yard drive giving tcu a 32 20 lead

 it took only one game into the second half of the season for the nets world they lead the atlantic division by four games to seem uncertain a 105 103 loss to the atlanta hawks at philips arena tonight included an injury scare to the nets starting power forward kenyon martin martin injured his right wrist in the second quarter he said he did not know how though he returned to the game he attempted only dunks in the second half it 's really sore martin said later mike bernot the hawks orthopedist gave martin the best news of the night for the nets x rays revealed that he had a bruise that left the nets to focus on how this game got away with 3 minutes 28 seconds remaining they were ahead by 101 94 and all signs pointed to victory but that was before the hawks scored 11 of the game 's final 13 points still the nets had possession of the ball with 44 seconds left they inbounded to point guard jason kidd whose 3 point attempt could have won it the ball bounced off the back of the rim i had a good look kidd said i would take that shot again if i had it the loss which dropped the nets to 32 16 left coach byron scott in a sour mood scott said the nets terrific first half of the season had put a target on our back as teams tried harder to defeat them we gave this game away basically scott said guard jason terry 's two free throws with 44 seconds left won the game for atlanta 17 33 he finished with 28 points shareef abdur rahim had a game high 34 shooting guard kerry kittles led the nets with 20 points kidd had 12 points 14 rebounds and 9 assists we did n't shut the door kidd said this was still a dress rehearsal for us we 're still learning how to play together kerry kittles 's three baskets gave the nets a 6 4 lead but they were undermined by a torrent of mistakes when kittles threw a pass away that led to nazr mohammed 's dunk and a 23 12 hawks lead all five nets starters had committed a turnover add to those woes the fact that martin incurred his second foul five minutes into the game as kidd began to warm up so did the nets held to no points or assists in the first quarter kidd scored 6 points in the second quarter with 6 rebounds an assist and a steal not coincidentally the nets forged a 57 56 halftime lead forward richard jefferson also came alive scoring 13 of his 15 points after martin was called for his third foul with 7 02 left in the half by scoring 11 of the quarter 's first 13 points the nets tied the game at 39 39 on jefferson 's drive and free throw from there the lead changed eight times the nets finished strong with jefferson making a jump shot and kidd dribbling through atlanta 's interior defense for a runner with 26 seconds left kidd also put together a highlight film during one span of the third quarter he made a 3 point shot then displayed his passing skills he fed kittles with a 30 foot pass for a layup and ended a fast break with a behind the back pass to keith van horn for another layup then came the topper a perfect alley oop pass to martin that led to a thunderous dunk the nets seemed on the way to an easy victory but terry would not allow it he had 13 points in the quarter offsetting aaron williams 's 5 points which gave the nets an 82 78 lead as it turned out though the game was a long way from over

 cosmologist professor of mathematics and physics duke university in the coming years cosmologists are likely to find more information to reinforce einstein 's general theory of relativity or as some believe we may discover from research on the largest scales in the cosmos that general relativity needs to be modified general relativity will likely be reinforced in the not too distant future by observations of the supermassive black hole believed to lie at the center of our galaxy on the largest scales how general relativity performs will hinge on what we learn about the dark side dark energy and dark matter which are invisible and comprise about 95 percent of the universe the dark energy is about 70 percent and dark matter about 25 percent though we have a theory about dark matter the nature of this dark energy is a mystery
 todd zeile has heard the grumbling in dugouts around baseball the yankees get every call in yankee stadium the ball always bounces the yankees way and every time the yankees stock up on talent during the season you hear sarcastic shows of emotion zeile admitted zeile is quick to add that he never indulged in those sour grapes himself and now he has been rewarded with a tour of duty with the rich and talented and dominating and perpetual yankees he was in the lineup yesterday as the yankees beat toronto 4 0 to improve their record to 12 victories and 3 losses the yankees have not won a world series in two years now but they are the champions all the same they have now tied the best start in the history of the club just when the underclass of the north american baseball world thought the yankee domination could not possibly get worse this pitching staff looks like it could win oh let 's be conservative 120 or 130 games this season the scary part is that the yankees are not even getting much from about 50 million worth of their payroll what with derek jeter mariano rivera and steve karsay injured and sterling hitchcock and jose contreras hardly contributing for the yankees 50 million is a mere offering to placate the baseball gods the yankees are loaded in cable income and in the dugout jeter gets hurt erick almonte hits a home run in his first start the young shortstop does look a little shaky right now but the yanks can carry him a long way the outfield looks a little shaky hideki matsui comes along with professional skills and even a wry sense of humor some starters may not last forever jeff weaver threw 120 pitches yesterday to show that the near future may be very much like the recent past some people think none of this is fair even some people in opposing dugouts think it is n't fair i always felt you were playing more than that particular team said zeile now with his 10th team making it sound as if billy martin were chasing windblown pop ups and elston howard were hitting one into the gap and so on and so on zeile and his fellow emigre robin ventura say they never resented the yankees domination when they were on the other side rather they respected the yankees for what they were and what they did you look at them ventura said yesterday on his day off they had a lot of players come up through the system jeter bernie mariano jorge they saw something in tino to replace mattingly and a lot of it has to do with joe full names are not necessary for this cast of characters now part of the ever expanding yankee legend ventura came along with the white sox while the yankees were down in the early 90 's by the time he got to the world series with the mets in 2000 the yankees were back to demoralizing everybody who came along we felt we could play with them ventura said recalling bobby valentine 's scrappy band way back when that hopeful state was dissipated in the first game the mets had a 3 2 lead with one out in the bottom of the ninth and armando benitez had a 1 2 count on paul o'neill who then obsessively fouled off four pitches we started to think 'we really need to get this guy out ventura recalled instead o'neill walked on the 10th pitch scored the tying run and the yankees won the world series in five games that one at bat by paul set a tone ventura recalled they have the end result it is a collection of doing things right the yankees new dynasty is not merely about money but about making the right choices the mets let ventura and zeile get away spent foolishly and are now looking like 1962 ineptitude at 2003 prices meanwhile ventura and now zeile have moved seamlessly into the yankee clubhouse just like dozens of other lifers when they won the bronx lottery for a season or two everybody wants to wear the uniform unless you 're a dyed in the wool red sox fan or something zeile said you feel you are fortunate to wear the uniform most teams just ca n't break the barrier zeile added there 's a mental edge the latest example came on this homestand now ended we were down 5 0 then it was 5 5 ventura said talking about wednesday 's game the yankees ultimately lost but yesterday they dominated it has happened before it seems to be happening again

 a generation gap apparently must still be bridged on the devils exciting new line left wing patrik elias referred to center joe nieuwendyk recently as mr nieuwendyk as if he were playing next to gordie howe i manage when i play with mr nieuwendyk elias said elias was joking but only a little he holds nieuwendyk nearly 10 years older than elias in high esteem nieuwendyk might have scored 357 more goals than elias in the national hockey league but they have quickly discovered that they play the game in a remarkably similar way we make decisions that are good for the line nieuwendyk said we do n't get ourselves in too much trouble out there add the industrious right wing jamie langenbrunner who often played on the same line with nieuwendyk before the devils acquired them last week from dallas and the devils have a unit that is quick smart and resourceful nieuwendyk 's line had two goals and three assists in a 3 1 victory monday night over florida but there is intrigue line combinations are meant to be broken elias played with jason arnott and petr sykora on the devils a line which stayed together for most of three seasons before arnott was included in the deal for nieuwendyk and langenbrunner sykora came down with the flu last week and has not played since nieuwendyk joined the devils who play the pittsburgh penguins on wednesday night coach kevin constantine who is not much for making commitments said that elias was put on nieuwendyk 's line because there was nowhere else to put him for now we 're still not sure where we want him in the end constantine said of elias a good problem for a coach to have appears to be simmering the devils 33 26 9 4 just 2 points behind the islanders for sixth place in the eastern conference appear to have too many good players nieuwendyk 35 and langenbrunner 26 road roommates with the stars have played even better together in four games with the devils than they did in dallas it 's made a world of difference i 'm sure langenbrunner said of playing next to nieuwendyk the devils best line recently center bobby holik and wings scott gomez and sergei brylin does not appear likely to be broken up that leaves one spot open on the top two lines for elias and sykora and elias has it for now elias was asked if he might really need a big tough center someone like arnott to establish a physical presence he shrugged then said of playing next to nieuwendyk i do n't think we missed anything on the physical side to be honest with you maybe elias said the days of the a line were meant to end because we did n't have the confidence that we 'd had in the last couple of years we threw the puck away instead of hanging on to it elias said besides langenbrunner can supply the grit nieuwendyk fed elias for a goal monday on a beautiful play in which elias faked a slap shot to get florida goaltender trevor kidd out of position then tucked the puck into an open net that goal came on the first shift of the second period on the first shift of the third period nieuwendyk fed elias with a pass through the slot kidd stopped elias but langenbrunner popped in the rebound for the winning goal i think you could put a lot of people with patrik and they 'd feel comfortable nieuwendyk said elias sounds as if he feels the same way about his new linemates even though they may soon become old linemates we 're all on the same page langenbrunner said we want to do the same things with the puck
 for 11 consecutive years bob huggins has taken cincinnati to the ncaa tournament it is a rite of spring in american sport the bearcats arrive every march with a wealth of talent and a gaudy dazzling record this year for the first time cincinnati was also awarded a no 1 seeding and then on thursday for the eighth successive year cincinnati won its first tournament game on the eve of today 's game with ucla with a wide uncharacteristic grin huggins said jokingly that the top seeding and maybe st patrick 's day would bring his team luck but not every spring custom involving cincinnati and the ncaa tournament delivers a smile to huggins 's face most times in fact march ultimately leaves him grumpy today for the fifth time in six years huggins 's bearcats were eliminated from the ncaa tournament in the second round squandering an 11 point second half lead cincinnati became the first top seeded team of the 2002 tournament to lose as the bearcats fell in double overtime to ucla 105 101 at mellon arena although once again one of the most gifted teams with an all american senior guard in steve logan who led the bearcats beyond modest preseason predictions cincinnati will nonetheless be going home far earlier than expected i just wish we could get a bounce or a break in this tournament something to go our way huggins said there will be other interpretations of how and why cincinnati 31 4 lost ucla for example played with more passion and energy in the game 's closing stages the bruins were deeper had fresher legs got brilliant performances from their stars when cincinnati did not and dominated the tall cincinnati front line late in the game while cincinnati had the experience in the backcourt it was ucla 's two freshman point guards cedric bozeman and ryan walcott who played the entire 50 minutes without a turnover ucla 21 11 came into the tournament with losses in four of its previous six games but its recent tournament experience is the reverse of cincinnati 's ucla is one of three colleges duke and kentucky are the others that has advanced to the round of 16 in four of the last five seasons ucla coach steve lavin is 5 0 in second round games during his six seasons with the team we 've had a strange up and down year said lavin whose team will play 12th seeded missouri in the west regional semifinals on thursday in san jose calif we 've been trying to blend senior veteran players and these skilled and talented freshman it 's been tough sometimes but i think the mix of older and younger may be finally paying off cincinnati 's leonard stokes had 39 points in large part because ucla was focusing its defense on logan but ultimately stokes tired and his shots stopped falling late in the game when it was logan 's turn to resurrect cincinnati he had no answers logan missed two open shots near the end of regulation and made only one a meaningless 3 pointer in the final moments in the overtime periods he finished with 18 points but was 6 for 18 from the floor as cincinnati was sagging ucla was surging although cincinnati appeared to have the game in control with a 65 54 lead with 9 minutes 25 seconds to play in regulation ucla 's matt barnes helped the bruins charge back into the game with back to back 3 point shots that cut the bearcats lead to 65 60 the lead remained 5 points until a put back by barnes and a 3 point shot by jason kapono tied the score 71 71 ucla appeared the stronger more confident team thereafter especially under the basket while cincinnati had controlled the boards with 13 offensive rebounds that led to 17 second chance points in the first half ucla adjusted in the second half playing a more traditional zone defense and worrying less about logan ucla outrebounded cincinnati and had 13 second chance points to cincinnati 's 5 as the game wore on ucla 's offense was growing more versatile as cincinnati 's was growing more one dimensional cincinnati rarely worked the ball inside in the game 's final minutes or in overtime for ucla barnes continued to sparkle as a scorer and playmaker and center dan gadzuric had 13 rebounds to go along with his 26 points both teams had chances to win the game at the end of the second half but neither made its final shots it was much the same at the end of the first overtime in the second overtime logan and stokes who each played 46 minutes appeared fatigued as did most of the cincinnati team ucla quickly grabbed a 4 point lead that it extended to 6 in the final minute cincinnati had nothing left for a last charge huggins conceded that his team was probably tired by the second overtime but he focused his lament on the missed opportunities at the end of regulation and on a missed shot by immanuel mcelroy at the end of the first overtime we also had a tip in attempt off that missed shot that could have won the game he said huggins also called ucla the most talented eighth seed in the history of the ncaa tournament their power forward gets 17 points and 11 assists huggins said of barnes that has n't happened since magic johnson lavin said there were times in this season when you had to really wonder if something like this would come to us but these players have been resilient throughout that 's the lesson of the season and of today
 the first major upset of this year 's national collegiate athletic association men 's basketball tournament was within grasp unsung butler had used poise discipline and fierce defense to seize control and with 81 seconds remaining in overtime sent one of its top free throw shooters to the line to add to a 1 point lead but rather than come away with the victory the free throws and with it the game went awry for 12th seeded butler instead mike miller 's decisive drive down the lane as time expired lifted fifth seeded florida to a 69 68 victory in opening round action in the east regional i just penetrated and floated one up over the top of somebody and it happened to go in said miller who led his team with 16 points and 13 rebounds officials reviewed videotape to be sure the shot went in before time expired the victory by florida 25 7 ended a streak in which one 12th seeded team had recorded a first round upset every year since 1989 the gators will face illinois a 68 58 winner over pennsylvania here at joel coliseum florida forced the overtime by rallying from 7 points down in the final 4 minutes 1 second of regulation the gators udonis haslem hit two free throws with 152 seconds left to tie the score at 60 60 florida then survived a missed 3 pointer by butler 's lavall jordan to reach overtime the bulldogs champions of the midwestern collegiate conference had a 68 65 advantage with 305 seconds left in overtime on a 3 pointer by guard andrew graves the last of his game high 20 points florida answered with a layup by kenyan weaks with 10 seconds remaining and quickly fouled jordan an 833 percent free throw shooter but the junior guard still grieving the death earlier this week of the great aunt who raised him missed both foul shots with 81 seconds remaining that set the stage for the last frantic possession ted dupay got the ball to the frontcourt and shoveled a pass to miller near the 3 point arc the 6 foot 8 inch forward drove the lane and launched the winning shot as he fell to the court and the buzzer sounded you tend to think that when you 're up 3 or 4 with 20 seconds to go that this game you 're going to win you 're going to advance butler 's graves said it starts creeping in and then when all of a sudden the carpet gets pulled out from underneath of you it 's like the end of the world illinois 68 penn 58 in the opening game no 13 pennsylvania rallied from early foul trouble and a 15 point deficit in the first half but the quakers faded down the stretch against fourth seeded illinois 22 9 after penn took a 6 2 lead illinois took control gradually building its lead to 27 12 with 7 57 left in the half on a 3 point play by forward marcus griffin who contributed 10 points off the bench in the period griffin a 6 foot 9 inch junior finished with 16 points for illinois equally daunting for penn michael jordan the ivy league player of the year picked up three fouls within a span of 39 seconds limiting his time and effectiveness duke 82 lamar 55 top seeded duke overcame a 3 point barrage by lamar and its own uninspired defensive effort in the first half as late as the 4 01 mark of the first half the cardinals 15 16 were within a basket at 34 31 after two free throws by landon rowe a senior forward but duke 28 4 closed the period with a 10 2 rush then gradually pulled away kansas 81 depaul 77 nick bradford scored 14 points and had a key block in the waning seconds of overtime as kansas spoiled depaul 's return to the ncaa tournament kenny gregory made 11 of 12 field goal attempts and matched his season high with 22 points to help the eighth seeded jayhawks 24 9 win their first round game for the 17th consecutive year depaul 21 12 seeded ninth was making its first appearance in the tournament since 1992
 the yankees played as if they had a flight to catch tonight and they only wish that were true after sprinting through a 5 3 loss to the baltimore orioles in 2 hours 12 minutes the yankees wondered openly about the wisdom of playing on thursday with hurricane isabel bearing down on this city i 'm sorry we have to play period said david wells who pitched a complete game in the loss it 's not good the city 's closing down the government 's closing down and we 're playing figure that out yankees players were informed this morning that thursday 's game had been moved up to 12 35 pm from 7 05 pm it was little consolation the yankees wanted the orioles to postpone the game and reschedule it for next weekend in new york the orioles who are home through the weekend said today that they believed there was at least a chance the storm would pass a compromise proposal that had been discussed earlier in the week a day night doubleheader today was rejected by the players union said mike mussina the yankees representative so the yankees are left to hope they can play on thursday and fly to florida for a weekend series with the tampa bay devil rays they plan to take a bus to philadelphia after thursday 's game and meet their charter there i do n't really see it first baseman jason giambi said i do n't see the need to get it in especially when they 're shutting down schools and having the navy get their ships out i hope everything works out and everybody 's safe i do n't understand the thinking of what they 're trying to accomplish joe torre the yankees manager had a theory everybody 's scratching their head about why we 're cutting it so close but it 's not our decision torre said later adding when you 're dealing with revenue in today 's game that 's what it comes down to it was windy at times tonight but it did not rain mussina who is scheduled to start thursday in pursuit of his 200th career victory has reasonable expectations for the weather asked if he hopes the wind blows in mussina said i just want to be able to stand out there wells also has 199 career victories but he squandered his chance for no 200 early in the game tonight he retired 18 of his last 19 hitters and the one base runner in that stretch was caught stealing meaning wells faced the minimum from the third out of the second inning through the orioles last batter but he allowed 5 of the first 10 batters to score two on home runs larry bigbie drove a 2 0 pitch over the fence in left for a homer in the first and jay gibbons crushed a high slider over the right field wall on wells 's first pitch in the second four of the next six orioles had hits leading to three more runs wells quickly settled in aiming the ball around the knees keeping it low and satisfying torre i congratulated him on coming back torre said he was down 5 0 and he did n't quit i respect that the yankees had nine hits in six and two thirds innings against baltimore 's eric dubose but scored only in the fourth and seventh juan rivera pulled a two run homer off the foul pole to close the gap to two and chase dubose but that was as close as they got wells who has two more starts left in the regular season said he was not disappointed about failing to become the 99th pitcher with 200 victories it does n't matter wells said i want to win that 's all it does n't matter if i win or somebody else wins mussina has been more introspective talking about the milestone today he listed several prominent pitchers who never reached it including sandy koufax dizzy dean ron guidry and the yankees pitching coach mel stottlemyre stottlemyre was in his 11th season with the yankees and had 164 victories when he started on june 11 1974 in the fourth inning he threw a curveball to the angels frank robinson and felt a pop in his right shoulder it was a torn rotator cuff and stottlemyre pitched two more innings the rest of his career he was done at age 32 as a pitching coach stottlemyre saw david cone and dwight gooden begin sparkling careers that ended shy of 200 to stottlemyre the number carries a special meaning three hundred is way up there at the top but there 's not too many that have won 200 either stottlemyre said that 's a heck of a plateau we have one guy at 300 and two guys going for 200 and all three are still regular starters in a very good rotation still contributing and still very forceful when they go out there mussina who turns 35 in december said he did not know if he would pitch long enough to get to 300 as roger clemens did in june i 'm certainly not getting any younger the strike zone is getting smaller and smaller and the hitters are getting bigger and stronger mussina said am i still going to be as effective three years or seven years from now i do n't know whatever happens mussina said he will have accomplished something important after his next victory to be able to walk away from the game and say you won 200 you know it 's not 300 but it 's certainly something mussina said

 his first shot in his first practice in more than a month was by his own admission pretty awkward but it took nets center todd macculloch no more than an instant to get it right he grabbed his own rebound and laid the ball in a sign that his problems were largely behind him macculloch who had been sidelined since feb 22 with plantar fasciitis a heel injury in his left foot breezed through his first practice since being placed on the injured list and was given clearance to play in sunday 's game against the atlanta hawks it felt pretty good macculloch said i was able to run the court and all we did n't go all that long today but we did some shooting and i had some contact and afterward i did a little bit extra in the post working on my offense and defense with jason collins i was just trying to get back in the flow a little bit macculloch was in uniform for the nets 108 84 victory friday over milwaukee but coach byron scott decided not to play his 7 foot center until after seeing how he held up in a full practice like macculloch scott was pleased he looked good today scott said i wanted to make sure that i was comfortable with him and that he was comfortable and that 's why i thought having him practice today and have him go up and down the court was very important i wanted him to be able to have no doubt that he was fine watching him i did n't see any glitches which means he was n't favoring that foot he was just going up and down the court and not thinking about it scott said macculloch would play sunday but would not start aaron williams will but scott is confident that macculloch can contribute some productive minutes while working his way back into the starting lineup when his chest starts burning after going up and down the court i 'll be able to see it scott said we did n't do enough today in practice for him to get too tired being that he has n't played in a month i 'm sure he 'll be a little anxious and a little excited i 'll try to monitor his minutes a little bit the nets struggled in macculloch 's absence going 7 8 after being acquired from philadelphia during the off season he has proved to be a steady and reliable force inside and is averaging 99 points and 62 rebounds the nets acknowledged they missed him he gave us rebounds blocked shots and points in the paint jason kidd said he can open up the perimeter game for other guys because he can go inside and score or pass he brings a lot to the table we did n't overlook his absence we knew there were some matchups particularly out west where we needed him the important thing is that we held the ship together and are right where we were when he went out scott is happy the nets are happy and macculloch is very happy for him a tough time is at last over this has been the most difficult period of my basketball life he said there have been a lot of mind games going on it was always a case of 'should i sit out or should i play with it at what point do you make a decision it 's been really difficult and i just hope it 's over it appears that it may be the nets a team that was hit with an overwhelming run of injuries last season are hoping to be at full strength for the playoffs now that macculloch is back right now we are playing good basketball and we feel like everybody is getting healthy at the right time scott said getting todd back is another piece of the puzzle one that we were missing rebounds the nets have two games left on their regular season schedule against philadelphia which will be without allen iverson for four to six weeks iverson broke a bone in his hand in friday 's victory against boston philly is a talented team so you ca n't count them out jason kidd said larry brown will get those guys to play look at what happened against boston iverson missed the second half and they still won the nets will probably clinch a spot in the playoffs next week something they have not done in five seasons
 a federal judge ruled wednesday that hasim rahman did not violate a long term contract with his former promoter when he signed a deal with don king in may to have king promote him but the judge miriam goldman cedarbaum said the former promoter cedric kushner had the legal right to act as rahman 's promoter in an expected rematch between rahman and lennox lewis the british heavyweight fighter who lost his international boxing federation and world boxing council titles to rahman in april after returning from that five round upset in south africa rahman dropped kushner and signed with king who tried to arrange a fight against david izon in beijing on aug 5 lewis and kushner each sued rahman and king saying they had breached contracts that rahman had signed cedarbaum ruled last week in federal district court in manhattan that rahman had to first fulfill a contractual obligation to give lewis a rematch before fighting anyone else for 18 months although kushner has the contractual right to sell rahman 's services in a rematch cedarbaum wrote in her decision the violation of that right is not so irreparable that it can not be compensated for by monetary damages what that means is that king can act as rahman 's promoter in the lewis rematch but he and rahman will have to pay kushner damages for a contractual breach a trial to determine the amount of damages is scheduled for october kushner 's lawyer rich edlin said that at a minimum king owed kushner all the money he would make off the rematch as far as we 're concerned king is working for us he said king said i do n't feed into that he declined yesterday to comment further but kushner 's side is not entirely pleased with the decision although edlin had argued that the rahman kushner promotion agreement should have lasted until mid june and that it had been extended beyond that with a 75000 check kushner had given one of rahman 's managers cedarbaum ruled that the original contract had expired in mid april at the latest king who agreed to give rahman a 5 million signing bonus in may is now legally rahman 's promoter before rahman left kushner hbo was offering 14 million to rahman to have a rematch with lewis while showtime was offering 20 million for a rahman mike tyson fight both of those deals were scrapped when king announced the rahman izon fight but now that rahman must fight lewis and there is no possibility of a bidding war it is almost certain that rahman will not get anything close to the original offer for the lewis bout the rahman izon fight had been scheduled on the undercard of a heavyweight title fight between evander holyfield and john ruiz the world boxing association champion the night the judge decided rahman must fight lewis a cable television company rainbow sports network backed out of a tentative agreement it had with king to distribute the beijing fight king said yesterday that his own television company kingvision will distribute the fight

 for this day at least there was no acrimony no angry fans no critical news media patrick ewing 's retirement after 17 mostly distinguished seasons as a pro basketball player turned into a lovefest there was ewing sitting at a table at a midtown hotel it 's a lot easier for me to sit because i do n't want to hurt my back announcing that he was retiring and disclosing that he would become an assistant coach for the washington wizards standing along the walls were former knicks teammates and rivals charles oakley allan houston mark jackson charlie ward herb williams alonzo mourning and kenny smith among those in the audience were mike jarvis who coached ewing at rindge and latin high school in cambridge mass and who now coaches at st john 's jeff van gundy the knicks coach during ewing 's final years in new york and don chaney the current knicks coach in his 15 seasons with the knicks followed by single seasons with the seattle supersonics and the orlando magic ewing a 7 foot center scored 24815 points the 13th highest nba total in 1996 he was voted one of the 50 greatest players in nba history he turned 40 last month and has been fighting injuries his retirement was no surprise i 've thought about it a lot ewing said basketball has been very good to me i 've made a lot of friends and some enemies i felt it was time for me to move on it was a great ride it was a hard decision to make because i think i could still play but it was time for me to go on to the next chapter of life critics in the news media often called ewing selfish more interested in personal than team accomplishments fans berated him mostly for never winning an nba championship but as oakley said of the sellout crowds at madison square garden they pay their money it 's not about being fair for one day love conquered all i love new york ewing said i would n't trade it for anything in the world the good the bad if i had to do it over again some things would change but i enjoyed every minute i enjoyed the fans they were great we had some good times i 'm sorry we could n't bring a championship here i hope that one day new york will have a champion i would n't be anywhere else than new york it will always be my home but not his next place of employment that will be in washington where he will assist doug collins and help coach the team president michael jordan if jordan plays another season not coincidentally ewing and jordan who were longtime rivals on the court have the same agent david falk when you 're a player people always ask you what you want to do when you finish ewing said i still do n't know the wizards offered me a job and i will take it it 's a learning experience i 'm going to work at it as hard as when i played i 'll still be involved i 'll be happy i 'm not going to consider myself just a big man 's coach i think i have got more to offer falk would not discuss specifics of ewing 's coaching contract it 's not signed yet falk said it 's short term he wants to see if he likes it it 's a two way audition ewing said he had coaching offers from a lot of other teams he said he talked with the knicks and was told they had nothing to offer this year but would have something next year his retirement ewing said is more or less final a few teams have called and said they needed a center he said but unless someone on the wizards goes down i do n't think it will happen in recent weeks ewing discussed the decision with williams his knicks understudy and now a knicks assistant john thompson his coach at georgetown and van gundy williams said he told ewing that coaching was far different from playing you 've got to get used to it williams said and doing it every day it 's not like coming in for two or three hours a day you 're there before the players come and you 're there after they go home it 's not like looking at one player on tape and figuring how to guard him you have to take a broader look van gundy said i think patrick will do well in learning to coach i do n't think you can determine until it 's done whether he will enjoy it coaching is a different life from playing it 's hard for any great player like himself when he 's coaching and has to deal with players less committed and less talented his knowledge of the game will help oakley a power forward who played with the chicago bulls last season was ewing 's teammate for 10 years on the knicks as a player patrick just came to work and put in a lot of effort oakley said as a coach he 'll do a good job jackson a former knicks point guard now with denver said what made patrick a great player was determination discipline and dedication i played against him when i was at st john 's and we were scared of him he was supposed to be a mean giant on and off the court that was the farthest from the truth when i came to the knicks he was the one who embraced me he made life a lot easier for me if it were n't for him i would n't be playing for these 16 years how would ewing like to be remembered as a hard hat a hard nose with the work ethic that i brought he said jeff van gundy said that for a guy who did n't have a lot of athletic ability you showed them a lot i 'm a guy who tried to do his best to help his team win basketball did n't come easy to me a lot of things did n't come easy to me i 'm proud of what i 've accomplished i thought i had a great career

 the question was about what mike hampton has learned this year about how he has changed hampton a left handed pitcher for the mets was about to let a visitor into his world which does not happen too often i 'm probably just better prepared to handle a lot of things he said this has been a growing experience all around not only is the situation magnified in new york but being in the playoffs and going this far has been a lot more pressure games you find out a little bit about yourself and how you 're going to react in those situations what hampton was asked has he learned about himself at this question hampton retreated shutting the door to his thoughts access denied man you ca n't just write my diary and everything hampton said it 's just stuff people wo n't understand understanding hampton has been a difficult task for his teammates and coaches as well as those who follow the team he does not talk about where he will be next season whether he will stay in new york or leave as a free agent that question looms over him as it did over mike piazza two years ago the players are aware of hampton 's pending decision and they do not know what it will be i 'm proud to have played with him said piazza the catcher i do n't know if it 'll be only this year but that remains to be seen he 's obviously a main reason why we 're here the mets would probably not be in the world series without hampton who went 15 10 and was the most valuable player of the national league championship series in which he beat st louis twice with 16 shutout innings but for a while it seemed as if the mets could not win with him hampton walked nine on opening day in japan he pummeled the water coolers in the dugout at colorado 's coors field after his last start in april when he struggled again five days later in san francisco he walked back to the team hotel alone finding solace in his thoughts and putting his struggles in perspective his record stood at 2 4 with a 652 earned run average in his 29 starts since then including the postseason hampton is 15 7 with a 237 era he righted himself by himself i was still new to the team so it was something i had to deal with myself he said i knew they felt for the way that i was throwing and always had confidence in me but it was just something i had to deal with on my own al leiter a fellow left hander did not know hampton when hampton played for houston he remembered him as stone faced an intense competitor not big on small talk or hugs behind the batting cage with opponents leiter who struggled early in '99 before finishing strong knew he could only subtly encourage his new teammate any time a guy 's struggling everybody from everywhere is trying to give you their remedy to fix it leiter said and really internally you pretty much know what you have to do that you have n't been doing mike is confident in the ability that he has and he was able to right himself by staying the course generally it comes down to a confidence thing you lose your confidence you start throwing balls you 're in hitters counts you 're not being as aggressive hampton 's confidence is extraordinary and after his performance in the nlcs it will be soaring when he takes the mound at yankee stadium for game 2 tomorrow he is open to suggestions saying he will keep learning for the rest of his life but interaction with hampton is much on his terms the pitching coach dave wallace said and supreme confidence is necessary to that approach that is fine wallace said even if not many pitchers are like that you just encourage him talk to him try to be the part that he allows you to be wallace said he 's pretty guarded in who he lets in and who he does n't somewhere around the middle of may or so your sense is that this is pretty nice and it 's working ok but you ca n't force yourself on anybody as a coach wallace gets help from veterans like leiter who enjoys talking about pitching philosophy with younger members of the staff hampton helps too wallace said although less with philosophy and more with mind set the left hander glendon rusch remembers throwing with hampton before spring training and being pleased with how open and friendly he was rusch and hampton have completely different styles hampton would rather give up a walk than a hit rusch the reverse but rusch has learned from him one thing i 've learned is i do n't have to give in as much rusch said it 's made me tougher to know that i can make my pitches be confident in myself and do that at any time in the count any part of the game that confidence has spread to the rest of the team whatever the mets know about hampton they know this when he pitches he gives them a great chance to win that is a major reason general manager steve phillips traded for hampton the mets needed another top of the rotation starter and the swagger that such a pitcher would bring oftentimes the feel you have going into the game has an impact on the way you play phillips said masato yoshii pitched well for us but it was n't the same feel of having mike hampton starting the game the mets have never been more confident in hampton than they were in his last start on monday in game 5 of the nlcs his teammates sensed an even greater concentration than usual before hampton pitched them to the pennant allowing three hits that was a different sort of focus than i 'd ever seen the left hander bobby m jones said he was n't saying a whole lot the tv was on but he was n't looking at it it was like he was looking through the tv wallace saw that determination but he also saw a polished fastball breaking ball and changeup in hampton 's pregame bullpen session it was evident warming up 'whoa ok the stuff is there wallace recalled now it was going to be a matter of catching breaks and making pitches a lot of times just because the stuff is there does n't mean a guy 's going to have a real good outing the tendency is to think 'well i 've got my good stuff and you forget to pitch hampton remembered how to pitch and won the most important game of his life even more important is the game that comes next if hampton learned something about himself from the last one only he knows nobody but hampton can write that entry in the diary
 just as it is about to begin the 2000 census has had a little glitch the census bureau this week began mailing 120 million letters one to every household in the country notifying residents of the impending census questionnaire the only problem is that each and every address is wrong the mistake first reported in today 's issue of the washington post occurred when a commercial printer hired by the government printing office inadvertently included an extra digit at the beginning of every street address kenneth prewitt the director of the census bureau called the mistake unfortunate but added that the united states postal service had assured the bureau that it would still be able to deliver the letters because computerized mail sorters rely on bar codes not on written addresses the letters which are to begin arriving on march 1 are part of a campaign by the bureau to maximize participation in this year 's census the error which mr prewitt said is not uncommon in mass mailings resulted from a software problem with the printer which mr prewitt declined to identify since the printer sent the letters directly to the postal service for delivery no one at the bureau caught the error he said the mistake will add a number between 1 and 4 to the street number of any address in an interview mr prewitt said that 80 percent of the addresses essentially all those with conventional addresses will have an extra 1 so the letter addressed to resident at 1600 pennsylvania avenue will show up as 11600 pennsylvania avenue a postal worker in new england noticed the error on tuesday and notified the postal service which pointed it out to the bureau it 's absolutely regrettable mr prewitt said on the other hand i can completely assure you that this has no consequences for the operation of the census it wo n't affect who is counted correction february 28 2000 monday an article about erroneous addresses on census bureau letters to 120 million households was omitted from some copies of the late edition on saturday although it was listed in the contents on page a1 the article is reprinted today on page a15

 there have probably never been more fascinating baseball monologues than the ones delivered by ted williams on hitting anyone who ever heard the man talk about hitting stood or sat mesmerized rapt hanging on every one of williams 's words to ask williams about hitting was to invite the baseball equivalent of a lecture on the theory of relativity by einstein or on the stars by galileo the only thing williams did better than talk about hitting baseballs was hit them in 1941 williams hit 406 sixty one years and thousands of players later no one has finished a season with a batting average that began with a 4 george brett batted 390 in 1980 rod carew 388 in 1977 larry walker 379 in 1999 todd helton 372 in 2000 wade boggs batted in the 360 's four times and then there was tony gwynn he batted 368 or better four times reaching 394 in the strike shortened season of 1994 if any latter day player was going to eliminate from williams 's name the appendage the last player to hit 400 it was gwynn it never happened the 400 thing i still ca n't see gwynn said a year and a half removed from his 394 performance it has n't been done in 54 years and i think there 's a reason why williams was n't simply the last to hit 400 he is the only player to hit 400 since 1930 in the major leagues and since 1923 in the american league putting williams 's feat in another perspective the home run record has been broken three times since he batted 406 when the home run record was still 61 gwynn was asked which he thought would be more difficult to do hitting 400 or hitting 62 home runs i think 400 is tougher he said in order to hit 400 you have to be pretty consistent all year long to hit 60 61 home runs all you need is a spurt i 've seen guys hit 10 11 home runs in a month you do n't necessarily need to be a good consistent hitter to hit 60 home runs i know home run hitters would disagree with me but to me hitting 400 is a tougher feat because you have to do it over 162 games two years later mark mcgwire broke roger maris 's home run record not with 62 but with 70 and three years after that barry bonds broke mcgwire 's record with 73 baseball still awaits a another serious flirtation with 400 consider four assaults on that magic number in the last quarter century in 1977 according to research by the elias sports bureau carew was hitting 401 on july 10 he batted a lusty 375 the rest of the season but fell short at 388 eight more hits in that time would have done the williams trick for him three years later brett was hitting 402 on sept 4 he batted only 323 the rest of the season and finished at 390 only five hits separated him from finishing at 400 in 1993 john olerud was hitting 400 on aug 2 instead of hitting 400 over the next two months he slumped to 290 and ended the season at 363 he would have needed 21 more hits to maintain his 400 average when the 1994 season ended after games of aug 11 gwynn was three hits short of 400 just three more hits anywhere along the way and he would have had his 400 season abbreviated though it might have been we were in august gwynn recalled later and we 're getting ready to get to the strike date and guys were telling me 'you got to go 10 for 18 or whatever we had a three game series with houston and i need to go something like 10 for 16 as it turned out gwynn went 6 for 13 and picked up just 2 points the mathematical lesson of batting averages struck home acting the opposite of a person 's weight points on a player 's batting average come off quickly but are difficult to put on as with home runs and hitting streaks players today face an obstacle williams did n't in 1941 at least not in quantity news media attention takes on a life of its own when a player is challenging a significant record or milestone dealing with the media would be the difficult thing gwynn said because when you get close they 're going to be all over you gwynn said that in 1994 he did n't get to experience that the season ended abruptly before his attempt to hit 400 could gather steam but he knew it was coming i knew if the season somehow was prolonged getting into september i was going to have to deal with that i would rather deal with the pitchers not giving me pitches to hit than dealing with the media part of it on the other hand in williams 's march to 400 he did not have the sacrifice fly rule working for him even if a runner scored from third base after a fly out unlike today the batter was charged with a time at bat available records do not show how many sacrifice flies williams had in 1941 but he certainly had some the league leading total of sacrifice flies in recent seasons has been approximately 15 if williams had 10 that season and they had been subtracted from his total at bats he would have batted 415 had he reached the final day doubleheader without those charged times at bat he would have been hitting 409 and would not have had to be concerned about playing so that he could legitimately in his mind hit 400 instead of doing it mathematically based on a 39955 average
 all signs pointed to a return to cleveland that is where manny ramirez had played the outfield for eight seasons and that is where those who knew him said he wanted to continue playing but ramirez decided tonight to change playing sites and agreed to play for the boston red sox his price was 160 million for eight years a person familiar with the agreement said in the space of several hours today major league baseball which had never had a player earn 20 million a year suddenly had two earlier alex rodriguez agreed to a 10 year 252 million offer from the texas rangers the red sox are expected to announce their newest acquisition in boston on tuesday by snaring ramirez the red sox completed an arduous effort that their executives intensified last week by spending two days in the office of ramirez 's agent jeff moorad but when they left newport beach calif without a deal the red sox appeared to be on their way to being losers once again two years ago they tried to snatch bernie williams from the yankees as a free agent only to drive up the price for the yankees who retained him by making a huge jump in their offer the indians did not play the yankees game today they tried to lure ramirez back to the fold back to the comfort of jacobs field but they were not prepared to meet boston 's offer the red sox went beyond the price they wanted to pay 144 million for eight years or 18 million a year but they were determined to make a dramatic move at times during the negotiations with the red sox and the indians moorad seemed to be taking a chance that he would price ramirez out of the market as he repeatedly said no to both teams but as kevin appier the pitcher who signed with the mets today said no was a very powerful word he referred to his own negotiations but his remark applied here as well ramirez batted 351 hit 38 home runs and drove in 122 runs in only 118 games last season in the previous two seasons he drove in 310 runs and hit 89 home runs he is considered perhaps the most lethal run producer in the major leagues

 the mets winter makeover will be complete if the milwaukee brewers pay a little now to save a lot later the mets the colorado rockies and the milwaukee brewers have agreed on the players in a three team trade that would send outfielder jeromy burnitz from the brewers to the mets two baseball officials said yesterday the unresolved issue is whether the brewers will send 750000 to the rockies to help offset todd zeile 's contract the mets would send zeile and outfielder benny agbayani to colorado and pitcher glendon rusch and infielder lenny harris to milwaukee the mets would receive burnitz pitcher jeff d'amico infielder lou collier and outfielder mark sweeney from the brewers in addition to rusch and harris the brewers would receive outfielder alex ochoa from the rockies the rockies want to make zeile their third baseman but also want to keep their payroll around 51 million and can not afford his 6 million salary the mets have told the rockies that they would not pay more than 325 million of zeile 's salary and colorado wants 750000 more both teams believe the brewers should pay that because of the large salary they are unloading by trading burnitz who will make 65 million next season and 11 million in 2003 brewers general manager dean taylor did not confirm any specifics of the deal but rusch and ochoa would fill holes on his team one sign that the mets and the rockies are ready to make the deal is that other options have begun to collapse the mets had discussed a deal for outfielder bubba trammell but the padres who had hoped to get agbayani and outfielder jay payton instead signed ron gant yesterday colorado considered pursuing seattle third baseman david bell but he seems likely to be traded to the san francisco giants another option for the rockies detroit 's shane halter was told by tigers manager phil garner yesterday that he would stay with detroit the rockies also appear to have soured on the free agent john valentin adding burnitz would mean the mets had revamped half of their everyday lineup which scored the fewest runs in the majors last season general manager steve phillips has already added second baseman roberto alomar outfielder roger cedeno and first baseman mo vaughn burnitz who played for the mets in 1993 and '94 would give the mets another power hitter to go with vaughn and mike piazza he is also like vaughn a left handed hitter who strikes out prodigiously burnitz fanned 150 times last season and vaughn had 181 strikeouts in 2000 the last season he played early this week phillips said he would not necessarily be concerned about having two players in his lineup who strike out so often it 's not just about strikeouts in a vacuum he said if a player strikes out but he also walks he 's a functional hitter i tend to look more at on base percentage and slugging percentage than i do just flat strikeouts burnitz had 80 walks and a 347 on base percentage his 416 slugging percentage would have trailed only mike piazza 's 573 and robin ventura 's 419 among mets regulars his 100 runs batted in would have led the mets only piazza had more homers than burnitz who hit 34 d'amico battled injuries last season and went 2 4 in 10 starts collier and sweeney are veteran reserves who would help fill out the mets bench which was thinned by the deal that sent desi relaford and tsuyoshi shinjo to the san francisco giants for pitcher shawn estes estes who was 9 8 last season submitted a salary arbitration request of 71 million well more than the mets offer of 58 million rusch suggested 33 million while the mets proposed 26 million posada seeks 775 million the yankees exchanged salary arbitration figures with four players yesterday catcher jorge posada suggested 775 million and was offered 67 million starter orlando hernandez asked for 355 million and was offered 3 million reliever ramiro mendoza asked for 28 million and was offered 26 million and outfielder shane spencer asked for 12 million and was offered 750000 of the 42 sets of figures exchanged over all yesterday posada 's was the highest request and the yankees offer to him was the highest the more significant figures for posada are 51 million and 55 million the yankees are trying to sign posada to a five year contract and a baseball official said the yankees would like to pay him 51 million while posada wants 55 million the yankees extended spring training invitations to several nonroster players including shortstop kevin elster who was out of baseball last season shortstop manny alexander will also be invited to camp
 the official who oversaw a plan for the pentagon to run a terrorist futures trading market is resigning under pressure a senior defense department official said today john m poindexter a retired rear admiral who was president ronald reagan 's national security adviser is stepping down within a few weeks the defense official said after the disclosure of a proposal that outraged lawmakers and embarrassed senior pentagon officials the plan was to create an online trading parlor that would have rewarded investors who forecast terrorist attacks assassinations and coups defense secretary donald h rumsfeld did not personally fire admiral poindexter but the defense official said that mr rumsfeld agreed that the admiral had become too much of a political lightning rod and that it was time for him to go it 's fair to say that the secretary understood what admiral poindexter understands which is that it 's difficult for any work that he might be associated with to receive a dispassionate hearing said the official who spoke to reporters at the pentagon today on the condition of not being named a spokesman for admiral poindexter and his organization the defense advanced research projects agency or darpa a research arm of the pentagon said he and the office had no comment on the resignation which was reported today by the wall street journal but admiral poindexter said in an e mail message to a friend which was given to a reporter on wednesday night that he had been contemplating resigning for several months to get out from under a steady stream of criticism and to spend more time sailing on the chesapeake bay admiral poindexter was engulfed in troubles nearly two decades ago in the iran contra scandal during the reagan administration more recently he oversaw development of a program at darpa that proposed spying electronically on americans to monitor potential terrorists that program originally called total information awareness was envisioned by admiral poindexter as a sweeping electronic surveillance plan that would forestall terrorism by tapping into computer databases to collect credit financial medical and travel records but this year congress barred the program from spying on americans and the pentagon changed its name to terrorism information awareness the latest furor centered on an initiative under admiral poindexter 's control called policy analysis market under the plan traders were to be able to begin registering on friday to trade futures in middle east developments as of oct 1 on a web site program which the pentagon was operating with private partners two democratic senators byron l dorgan of north dakota and ron wyden of oregon disclosed the existence of the futures program on monday calling it morally repugnant the defense agency staff has tried to defend the idea behind the program saying it was merely using the marketplace to assess the probability of events much like predicting elections or commodity prices but even senior pentagon officials like deputy defense secretary paul d wolfowitz said they were mortified that the program 's developers could be so politically tone deaf and they quickly agreed to kill the program today the senior defense official sought to soften the impact of what even staunch supporters of admiral poindexter acknowledged were whopping blunders we 've had a couple of programs of varying degrees of merit that have been seen as certainly unorthodox the official said it 's cutting edge and beyond that in some cases the defense official praised admiral poindexter for his very creative intellect and wished him luck in other counterterrorism efforts but he also said it was highly doubtful that the pentagon would seek his advice as a consultant any time soon republicans who had criticized the 3 million futures program today sought to prevent the debacle from tainting the agency 's other work although this was a serious mistake by darpa i believe that the agency has played a tremendously important function in our overall defense structure for decades senator john w warner the virginia republican who leads the armed services committee said in a statement adding darpa must continue to serve in the interest of our national security as for admiral poindexter 's future mr warner said that was a matter for the defense department to decide mr warner met with mr rumsfeld in the capitol within the last two days although the senator 's spokesman declined to say whether they discussed the admiral 's fate but democrats suggested more shenanigans were afoot in the pentagon that had not been uncovered the problem is more than the fact that admiral poindexter was put in charge of these projects senator patrick j leahy democrat of vermont said in a statement the problem is that these projects were just fine with the administration until the public found out about them senators dorgan and wyden said the outrage should fuel momentum to cut off all money to the terrorism information awareness effort even with today 's announcement the proposed tia program would still be the biggest spying and surveillance overreach in america 's history and it should be shut down the senators said in a statement

 it was function over fashion on the second day of the australian open jan michael gambill that once glittering young american hope walked onto court 1 today wearing a long sleeve white shirt clinging to his sculpted torso and was dismissed in straight sets 6 2 6 4 7 6 6 by wayne ferreira the still dangerous south african in last season 's clothes sixth seeded justine henin with her no nonsense cap and all business backhand shrugged off the wolf whistles and commotion in the stands and got the best of the better known but less forceful anna kournikova in her powder blue outfit with stylish white belt 6 2 7 5 pete sampras with american flags on his shirts and shorts in the spots usually reserved for his sponsors logos played precise and formidable attacking tennis to win his opening match against jarkko nieminen of finland 6 3 6 3 6 4 why the flags sampras 's deal with nike has expired and negotiations over a new agreement have broken down i can wear whatever i want so i thought i 'd wear this and a lakers cap said sampras his favorite team 's headgear in place for his postmatch news conference andre agassi might have withdrawn with a potentially career threatening wrist injury but sampras his longtime american measuring stick certainly appeared in fine form with his new coach tom gullikson watching from the stands his forehand had pop his serve was humming and at least for another round no one was in any mood to ask him how much longer he intended to keep playing the game that has brought him 13 grand slam singles titles but no titles of any kind in the last 18 months sampras has expressed no desire to stop in the near future and he said he trained more diligently than ever in the off season a concession to his 30th birthday in august and his unspectacular recent results michael chang another american veteran with a grand slam title in his past also continues to train hard but while sampras has been making impressive runs despite the accumulating years reaching last year 's united states open final chang has turned into an articulate hustling journeyman he has not advanced past the third round at a grand slam since 1997 and he did not make it past the first round today losing by 6 4 6 4 6 3 to a player with a marvelous future 20 year old roger federer of switzerland tough draws chang said afterward last week i had marat safin this week federer but i feel i 'm playing well his baseline rallies were entertaining today he is just not playing as well as the younger more powerful and versatile set and there was something symbolic about what happened after the match federer slung his racket bag over his shoulder and sauntered off while chang stuffed his belongings into his bag then rolled it off court on its wheels like a traveler heading for the check in counter at la guardia chang has seen a lot more airports than center courts of late it saves my sore shoulders chang explained our bags get so heavy expectations can be heavy items too last year was full of wide eyed joy for jennifer capriati as she proved that teenage burnout does not mean you will never fulfill your potential nobody expected her to win the 2001 australian open but the replica of the winner 's cup is now the first thing she sees when she walks into her florida home and most eyes were on her today when she walked into rod laver arena as the defending champion and top ranked player in the world i felt more of the butterflies earlier in the week when i made the trip over here i was feeling it she said but since i 've been here being around the grounds and practicing i felt ok i felt more than anything excited and could n't wait to get out there the eyes were also on her upper right leg taped because of a hip flexor that might have played a role in her opening round defeat in sydney last week against alexandra stevenson it was n't my day that day and i was really looking forward to getting here and starting here and maybe i was looking too far ahead of myself she said but that 's exactly why it 's called a warm up tournament though capriati called for a trainer early in the second set to adjust her strapping she covered the court beautifully throughout her 6 4 6 1 victory over silvija talaja of croatia in the seventh game of the opening set she even managed to race to three different corners of the court sprinting to her right to whip a forehand passing shot cross court for a winner you do n't win a rally like that without being very fit but can she maintain her fitness on these hard on the joint hardcourts it 's been a week since i hurt it she said of her leg i think i moved pretty well out there i felt comfortable i 've been able to train full out over the last few days fitness remains a hot topic here in the wake of the agassi 's surprise withdrawal i 'm by no means resigned to this being the end of anything he said before flying home to the united states sampras for one expects to see him on the courts again serena williams seeded fifth also withdrew unable to recover from the right ankle sprain she sustained in sydney last week her first round opponent was to have been conchita martinez who has dropped to 39th in the ranking instead martinez played the russian teenager lina krasnoroutskaya who won the first set martinez rallied to win the second and led by 2 0 in the third when krasnoroutskaya retired with an ankle sprain the moral of today 's story avoid martinez and while you 're at it dress down match points it has been a good start for young american men and that was even before 19 year old andy roddick the leader of the once maligned new wave played his first match taylor dent alex kim and james blake won monday with blake upsetting 14th seeded alex corretja of spain in four sets on tuesday mardy fish defeated the crafty french veteran fabrice santoro in four sets
 the west nile virus has now taken over the no 1 spot in the unofficial list of infectious threats from far off places the hong kong flu held the position three years ago and the ebola virus three years before that as before the driving force is fear and observers are enmeshed in controversy over what action to take millions of chickens were destroyed to curb transmission of hong kong flu to humans the west nile target is the mosquito with widespread insecticide spraying under way how dangerous is the virus we have data from 1999 indicating that it will kill 5 or 10 people along the mid atlantic seaboard if it is not controlled this corresponds with deaths from similar viruses transmitted from birds or mammals to people by mosquitoes but essentially nontransmissible from person to person assuming that control efforts are effective at breaking the transmission from bird to human several lives will be saved and many people will not have to suffer from the infection if this is the basis for supporting the spraying and for the attention given to the problem fine some people however worry that the virus will spread out of control and the news that it has been found in massachusetts will fuel those fears but the epidemiological study of infectious diseases like west nile suggests that this fear is overblown every year countless mosquito borne diseases immigrate into the united states often into regions where they once thrived malaria comes into kennedy airport and dengue fever slips across the mexican border into brownsville tex the mosquitoes that transmit these diseases are still here often in abundance yet the diseases do not really spread probably because our window screens air conditioned cars and buildings tend to keep us on the safe side of a boundary if mosquito borne malaria and dengue fever which are so superbly adapted to causing mischief in human beings can not make a go of it in modern day america then what chance does the little old west nile virus have paul w ewald is a professor of biology at amherst college

 democrats and republicans accused each other of racial and religious mccarthyism on wednesday at the beginning of a senate judiciary committee hearing to examine one of president bush 's federal appeals court nominees each side said the other was ruining the confirmation process and engaging in despicable and dishonest political behavior and all of that occurred even before the nominee janice rogers brown was introduced which is usually one of the first orders of business at a confirmation hearing justice brown of the california supreme court has been nominated to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit widely viewed as second in importance only to the supreme court she is regularly described by the california news media and by legal analysts as the most conservative justice on the california court and she has been an outspoken opponent of affirmative action and a strong critic of the growth of government in her tenure on the california supreme court she wrote the principal opinion enforcing proposition 209 the referendum prohibiting affirmative action programs although her colleagues agreed with her holding some refused to join her opinion in the 2000 case saying she had gone too far and had used needlessly scathing language in an effort to extend the proposition 's reach the hearing again demonstrated the deep partisan differences that have defined the committee and the fight over judicial confirmations for the last two years democrats denounced justice brown as insensitive to people 's rights ignorant of constitutional history and disrespectful of precedent republicans described her as one of the finest most qualified federal appeals court nominees because justice brown is an outspoken conservative african american her candidacy and the hearing evoked comparisons to the bruising confirmation battle in 1991 over the nomination of clarence thomas to the supreme court in one striking similarity on wednesday justice brown was questioned closely over her speeches which are often laced with vivid and attention getting language in april 2000 she said at a meeting of the federalist society at the university of chicago law school that where government moves in community retreats civil society disintegrates and ability to control our own destiny atrophies a result she said is a debased debauched culture which finds moral depravity entertaining and virtue contemptible senator dianne feinstein a california democrat asked you really believe that justice brown as clarence thomas did in 1991 dismissed the significance of her words saying they were just speeches she said she was simply stirring the pot a little bit getting people to think to challenge them republican senators began the hearing by complaining about a cartoon that appeared on a web site blackcommentatorcom that crudely caricatured justice brown as another clarence thomas they put a blowup of the cartoon on an easel and senators lined up to denounce it justice brown said she was deeply offended by the cartoon but republicans initially complained about the cartoon this week because they mistakenly believed it had been circulated by some of the liberal groups opposing her nomination glen ford the co publisher of blackcommentatorcom said a line on his web site saying the cartoon was part of the opposition statement by the naacp and the advocacy group people for the american way was incorrect senator patrick j leahy of vermont the committee 's ranking democrat complained that when he and others had tried to scrutinize nominees records they were barraged with shrill and unfounded name calling because of it mr leahy said the cartoon involving justice brown was no less offensive than those that depicted him as anti catholic when he opposed the nomination of a catholic candidate that was an especially despicable ploy that had not been seen in the senate in years senator leahy said contending that his opponents had stooped to religious mccarthyism are these groups going to be accused of being anti african american he asked senator john cornyn a freshman republican from texas who has strived to play a leading role in the committee 's confirmation battles cited the cartoon as an example of how hostile and destructive the senate 's judicial confirmation process has become
 it was todd greene 's second game with the yankees and his first as a catcher for roger clemens a simple assignment as far as greene was concerned he felt no need to dictate pitch selection or establish his credibility no greene figured clemens would do whatever he wanted and greene would just catch whatever he threw it is easy deferring to a future hall of famer especially on a night when he is throwing pitches 96 miles an hour and the hitters only defense is to gape in improving his record to 7 1 clemens struck out 10 baltimore batters working eight innings and allowing only three hits in a 4 0 victory over the orioles last night at yankee stadium the yankees are 33 25 a game out of first place in the american league east at a time the front office is evaluating possible changes in preparation for the last two thirds of the season it was the 97th time in clemens 's career that he struck out 10 or more batters tying him for third place with sandy koufax nolan ryan ranks first with 215 randy johnson second with 134 it was also the 267th victory of clemens 's career lifting him into 30th place past bob feller and eppa rixey clemens had his first serious brushback incident of the season his target was jerry hairston whose confident air has irked the yankees this season hairston exacerbated the ill will in the early innings last night paul o'neill was attempting to steal second base when a pitch was fouled off in the second inning rather than alert o'neill and allow him to pull up seen as a professional courtesy by most players hairston said nothing and o'neill slid into second o'neill appeared to say something to hairston on his way back to first the next half inning hairston slammed his bat down after popping up and clemens glared at hairston as he rounded first clemens threw a pitch high and inside to hairston in the fifth but did not hit him then in the eighth clemens threw two more pitches high and inside to hairston before pumping a fastball behind hairston hairston barely eluded the pitch the umpires issued no warning hairston again popped up again slammed his bat clemens glaring at him some more the orioles sidney ponson seemed to attempt retaliation in the bottom of the eighth barely missing scott brosius several times with inside fastballs aside from the brushback pitches most of clemens 's work was over the plate he threw a two strike fastball to the outside corner to the first batter of the game brady anderson a pitch that appeared to be an inch or two off the fringe but the home plate umpire jeff kellogg called strike three establishing a pattern clemens kept pumping two strike fastballs to that spot and when he was not finishing hitters with that pitch he was doing it with a splitter he struck out three in the first inning another in the second two in the third at least one in every inning through the first seven innings the yankees scored in the second when tino martinez o'neill and brosius hit consecutive singles off ponson 3 4 with one out greene who made his yankee debut the night before ripped a double to left center and two more runs scored greene who is filling in while jorge posada 's sprained left thumb heals doubled home another run in the eighth during a three hit night

 the harvard crimson scored on all six of its first half possessions intercepted three passes and held on to defeat columbia 45 33 yesterday at wien stadium the crimson 7 0 over all and 5 0 in the ivy league will face unbeaten pennsylvania a 21 10 winner over princeton next weekend at home the winner will clinch at least a tie for the ivy title we just said to the players 'let 's jump on these guys early let 's go out and prove we 're a good football team harvard coach tim murphy said and that 's exactly what we did the lions scored first marching 77 yards in nine plays on the game 's opening possession quarterback jeff mccall 's 1 yard sneak for a touchdown capped the drive from then on columbia 2 5 2 3 more closely resembled the team that had started the season 0 4 than the team that had won its last two games gaffes on offense defense and special teams buried the lions as harvard ran off 38 consecutive points it took the crimson less than three minutes to tie the score quarterback neil rose hit carl morris on a 10 yard crossing pattern that morris a junior receiver turned into a 36 yard touchdown morris faked out several defenders along the way six minutes later harvard took the lead for good on third and goal from the columbia 1 rose rolled to his right and threw toward morris who was covered well by philip murray murray had a chance to make a play on the ball but the pass went through his hands into the arms of morris for the crimson 's second score the scoring continued on the next possession after a big play by the crimson defense under a heavy rush on third and 20 from the columbia 34 mccall who finished 10 of 25 for 188 yards with three interceptions had his pass tipped at the line by kyle sims and then intercepted by linebacker dante balestracci at the 37 five plays later josh staph scored from 3 yards giving the crimson a 21 7 lead early in the second quarter we had played two good games without any really bad quarters or halves and we had hoped that momentum would continue columbia coach ray tellier said against a good team you really have to put four good quarters together and we obviously did n't do that today what had been an ugly half for the lions got worse robbie wright 's kickoff bounced off the head of columbia upback chris carey and into the hands of harvard 's eric lahaie at the columbia 29 seven plays later staph scored again this time from a yard out to push the lead to 21 points the crimson went on to lead by 38 7 at the half the 38 points were the most scored by a harvard team in the first half the lions tried to make a game of it in the second half after holding the crimson offense for the first time all day mccall hit jarel cockburn with a 45 yard touchdown pass the lions defense held again and a good punt return by justin logan put the lions at harvard 's 34 with nine minutes left in the third quarter but mccall 's next pass was intercepted by willie alford ending the threat early in the fourth quarter harvard tailback nick palazzo who finished with 132 yards on 18 carries broke free for a 32 yard touchdown run the crimson led by quarterback garrett shires who had replaced an injured rose pinched nerve late in the second quarter held on from there

 a pioneering database of human genes is now available for licensing again but human genome sciences which controls the database no longer plans to offer broad access to the data the company 's chairman and chief executive william a haseltine said over the weekend the genomics business came of age in 1993 when smithkline beecham agreed to pay 125 million for access to human genome sciences database of human genes access was subsequently provided to four other pharmaceutical companies bringing nearly 150 million in additional payments to human genome sciences based in rockville md but those deals all expired on saturday and rights to the data reverted to human genome sciences that has set off speculation about how the company will use the potentially valuable data dr haseltine said human genome would no longer offer other companies access to all the data rather it will use the data to help its own drug development efforts then he said human genome will license to other companies the rights to specific drugs or to narrow classes of drugs the decision reflects the shift in the company 's strategy from providing data and technology to other companies to developing its own drugs investors value drug companies more highly than genomics technology companies so many other genomics companies are trying to make a similar shift in addition although dr haseltine asserts that the database still has great untapped value it is certainly not as rare as it was in 1993 many more sources of gene information are now available the database contains information on 90000 human genes dr haseltine said scientists who sequenced the entire human genome estimate there are only about 30000 genes but dr haseltine says those scientists are wrong genes carry the instructions for making proteins human genome sciences found its genes by catching cells in the act of making the proteins without knowing at first what the genes did the fact that such uncharacterized genes could be used to help develop drugs rather than working backward to find the proteins and genes after understanding the disease was a radical notion at first now genomics is widely used although there is still debate on how effective the approach is human genome sciences has three drugs in clinical trials derived from its database but its five big pharmaceutical partners have only one among them a glaxosmithkline cardiovascular drug in early testing in a news release to be issued today human genome sciences says its partners are collectively pursuing 430 programs involving about 280 different genes for the creation of drugs that act on the proteins produced by those genes as well as 30 cases in which the protein itself would serve as the drug besides glaxosmithkline the other companies are schering plough takeda chemical industries of japan merck of germany and sanofi synthelabo of france the companies will be able to continue their work on those existing programs they will pay royalties to human genome sciences on any drugs that reach the market
 the epiphany came late last season when kenny anderson was rehabilitating his sprained right ankle and heard the whisper about his demise as a player afraid that the boston celtics might trade him or worse bench him anderson decided to change his approach to basketball people were saying 'man what are we going to do with kenny anderson recalled after the celtics practice today so i had to sit back and say to myself 'what can i do to make this team tick and also get my minutes and also be productive i 've got to fit in because if i do n't i can be traded or i can be lost in the loop so i 've got to get with it i 've got to take less shots i 've got to get in where i fit in i 've got to play defense i 've got to be a team player ok i 'll do that and it 's gratifying because everybody sees that and it 's making the team work anderson 's decision has helped to catapult the celtics into the eastern conference finals against the nets and it restored his reputation in the process though he never lived up to his billing as another tiny archibald anderson like archibald late in his career is helping the celtics chase a title both players are left handers both were new york high school legends and both were high scoring point guards early in their careers running the offense with precision hitting big jump shots when necessary and playing solid defense anderson 31 has emerged as one of the feel good stories of the postseason he is the former wunderkind who found happiness as a team player anderson 's first step was to talk regularly with coach jim o'brien toward the end of last season after playing only 33 games because of the ankle injury and a broken jaw anderson told o'brien to expect a much better player during the 2001 2 season we had a lot of discussions at the end of last year o'brien said he was very disappointed in the year that he was having because he was injured he was not real happy with the condition he came in last year and he basically talked about people thinking that his career was winding down and that he was going to prove them wrong i said i have no doubt that you will scrapping his typical off season regimen of light and inconsistent workouts anderson lifted weights worked out with a personal trainer and did shooting drills religiously just as important he embraced the notion of being a role player realizing that paul pierce and antoine walker were the focal points of the celtics offense he put less emphasis on trying to rack up statistics and on outplaying the opposing point guard anderson who averaged 188 points and 96 assists a game during the 1993 94 season averaged just 96 points and 53 assists this season but he realized that life could be good outside of the spotlight the attention is off me said anderson who averaged 138 points and 44 assists in boston 's second round victory over detroit it 's on paul and antoine and it 's a blessing i really love my position on this team because when i came into the league i was the franchise guy i was the go to guy and it can be rough at times i just want to be one of the wheels that makes the team roll instead of the big wheel my numbers might not be big but i think my presence is big anderson the second pick over all in the 1991 draft played his first four and a half seasons with the nets and became an all star before stops with charlotte and portland he said he would not have accepted the lesser role earlier in his career it took me a minute to swallow the pill anderson said but now i 'm 31 years old i 've got 11 years in the league i want to win i want to compete i want to do whatever it takes to make a franchise do well and also do well myself i 've taken a back seat and i 'm willing to do that for the success of the team anderson said his new attitude had spilled over into his personal life and that it will be even sweeter when yes he said when the celtics win the eastern conference title it 's weird because away from basketball it 's humbling me anderson said it helped me with being a better person somewhat to understand the sacrifices when we win the eastern conference final it will be more gratifying to me it 'll be like 'wow i did it but i did it this way instead of the old way that kenny would have done it i can be this type of person

 dr alvan feinstein an epidemiologist who advanced the science of disease diagnosis and prognosis and made significant strides in preventing rheumatic fever died wednesday in toronto where he was attending an awards ceremony he was 75 the cause was a heart attack according to dr ralph i horwitz a colleague of dr feinstein and chairman of the department of medicine at yale dr feinstein was the sterling professor of medicine and epidemiology the medical school 's most prestigious professorship he is known widely in his field for work that sprang from his undergraduate studies in mathematics which he later applied to developing what he called clinimetrics the idea behind clinimetrics used widely today is that it is possible to maintain consistency among assessments made by doctors through clinical indexes and rating scales for evaluating conditions like pain distress and disability more than anyone else in an era of molecular medicine and molecular biology dr feinstein was the champion of patient based data dr horwitz said he developed a science that allows you to do the measurements that can not be made by machines such as pain and disability and to do them in a scientifically rigorous fashion his greatest contribution was his advocacy for the information that patients can offer and the role that physicians can play in collecting that data dr feinstein 's research was fundamental in its focus on the most basic issues in the design and analysis of clinical investigation throughout his career he challenged widely accepted medical studies and tenets developed new clinical approaches and methods and promoted consistency in assessments of patients in the late 1950 's dr feinstein became medical director of irvington house an affiliate of new york university just outside new york city there he studied a large population of patients with rheumatic fever and challenged the belief that proper treatment after an early diagnosis kept those patients from developing severe heart disease later in life dr feinstein showed that the disease had different forms one he discovered causes joint pain and seldom progresses to heart disease the other which does result in heart disease has no symptoms to evoke early detection thus diagnosis of the disease at an early stage usually leads to a favorable outcome not because the early treatment is so beneficial but because those patients tend to have a less virulent form the clinical investigative techniques that dr feinstein developed through his six years of work on rheumatic fever led to improved diagnosis and treatment of the disease and its incidence has since declined markedly he applied those principles to later work on cancer therapy and prognosis in a study published in the archives of internal medicine last year dr feinstein and his team of researchers showed that breast cancers grew at differing rates and that aggressive treatments were not necessarily appropriate for cancers detected at an early stage by mammograms those detected early his work showed are often slow growing and relatively benign because mammography often detects less severe cancers he argued less aggressive treatment should be used whereas tumors detected through other approaches are often more serious alvan feinstein was born in philadelphia and received both his bachelor 's and medical degrees at the university of chicago he performed his residency at rockefeller institute and at its completion in 1955 he became medical director of irvington house in 1974 he left to head the yale school of medicine 's clinical epidemiologic fellowship a lover of writing who encouraged his students and colleagues to read strunk and white 's the elements of style dr feinstein published over 400 clinical studies and six books two of his books clinical judgment 1967 and clinical epidemiology 1985 are among the most widely referenced books in clinical epidemiology he is survived by his wife lilli sentz of new haven and two children daniel of camden me and miriam f gottlieb of ellenville ny

 obituaries in community newspapers used to be morsels of history daily biographies of ordinary lives but as sprawl swallowed small towns and corporations homogenized hometown papers obituaries in many places were reduced to little more than toe tags name rank and serial number the profit motive works in odd ways however many papers now sell obituaries like burial plots and life is slowly returning to the death pages you or your survivors can write your obit in the daily record here and many other papers media critics have warned of the peril of selling news columns what 's next convict covers own trial but people welcome that shot at 15 minutes of immortality the curtain call is how norma hehmeyer saw her father 's obituary and people are taking the bow with distinction he was a 14th generation mayflower descendant and loved woodworking and nature mrs hehmeyer wrote in the march 15 obituary of richard h jenks 89 he was also never too old to plan the next fishing trip peter m casale 83 retired machinist onetime semipro pitcher and bowler who once rolled a perfect game also played the banjo accordion snare drum and trumpet his obituary said on march 19 mr casale enjoyed the new jersey shore it added especially atlantic city before the casino era james daniel ryan 77 a retired engineer was an accomplished baton twirler as a young man his daughter wrote in his obituary he once marched with gen dwight d eisenhower in a parade in boston it was the largest military parade in us history the obituary said and the beginning of a long friendship between mr ryan and gen eisenhower it 's not quite tom sawyer attending his own funeral but it is a once in a lifetime chance to have it your way the allure of the paid obit said walt t lafferty the daily record 's publisher is if you want to say he was a yankees fan go ahead and say it and they do he was an avid baseball fan read last week 's obituary of edward holsten 95 following the yankees most of his life but shifting his allegiance to the baltimore orioles upon moving to maryland in 1992 his hobbies gardening clock repair hunting fishing raising fish and birds and fixing internal combustion engines including lawn mowers and automobiles achievements highlighted in recent daily record obituaries ranged from the accomplishments of a local businessman who once ran for governor to a nurse 's perfect attendance at a high school from which she graduated decades ago others are more soulful brother ambrose worked with humility in the monastery for 70 years read an obituary of a monk at st mary 's abbey for many years it said he delivered and distributed the campus mail and enhanced the environs of the monastery with beautiful flowers and plants the daily record began running paid obits last month the first 15 lines are free and up to 10 more lines cost 40 with each additional line costing 4 mr lafferty said deaths were verified with funeral homes but as at many papers facts supplied by families were not checked this was true of their free obits the new york times publishes both obituaries of prominent people written by reporters as well as paid death notices the daily record combines paid death notices containing funeral arrangement information with obituaries and lets people write what they want we thought it would be a better read mr lafferty said and i think they are they also strike a small blow at the impersonality of life and death margaret binette wrote her father 's obituary as he was dying mr ryan was not famous but his life as a successful engineer father of six and baton twirler would not have gotten its due in a one size fits all obit my father was a bigger than life person she said he was a real irish personality he lit up the room when he walked in he deserved to be honored not just by us but other people should know a great person has passed writing the final word on a life is a big responsibility you know mrs hehmeyer said you only get one obituary and now if you do n't like it it 's your own fault a guy just called me the other day about the new policy said andrew sullivan the daily record 's self described obit guy by night seton hall senior by day he wanted to update his obituary he was 70 and was n't ill at all

 to the sports editor as a longtime reader of the new york times i was surprised to open the march 9 edition and find myself lambasted by one of the times columnists for the decor of my office when university president turns into team cheerleader it 's trouble selena roberts is troubled by the sports memorabilia there i am a sports fan and i 'm not ashamed to admit that i 've coached little league baseball and youth basketball in almost six years as the president of the university of georgia i 've attended competitions of virtually every one of the intercollegiate sports we offer but i 've also attended dozens of concerts at our world class concert hall lectures on topics ranging from international diplomacy to higher mathematics a lot of plays many gallery openings and even a debate between the georgia team and oxford union we won the point is that the university of georgia is a comprehensive university judged by the fiske guide to colleges as one of the fastest rising in the country it 's not easy to pigeonhole this place but i 'll take the bait and use the metaphor roberts chose the decor of my office if she had visited my office before the march 5 news conference she would have also seen on the coffee table the latest issue of the georgia review one of america 's most respected literary journals she would have seen a copy of the pictorial history of this university one of the best of its kind she would have seen a sample of the recent offerings of the uga press the dominant feature of my office is the bookshelf which takes up an entire wall in the past few weeks while much of the news media 's focus has been on men 's basketball we have gone about the business of being one of america 's best public universities teaching very good students very well conducting critically important research well over 300 million worth and serving the people of this state as we were chartered to do that 's what the university of georgia is about michael f adams athens ga the writer is the president of the university of georgia

 officers of the consulting firm at kearney have selected hl henner klein a vice president based in brussels as their new chief executive mr klein whose election is expected to be announced today will have to wrestle with the problem of running a firm that wants to be an independent strategic consulting business but is a subsidiary of a huge public corporation the 138000 employee eds which bought at kearney in 1995 our first priority is that at kearney wants to be the trusted adviser and has to be neutral and has to do what is in the interest of its client mr klein said in a telephone interview from the firm 's office in brussels on friday the same challenge confronted mr klein 's predecessor dietmar ostermann whose three year term expires at the end of november mr klein 's term begins dec 1 mr ostermann was pressed by richard h brown then the chief executive of eds to make at kearney much more a component of its parent corporation and to run it more like a company than like a partnership one result was the withholding of bonuses to kearney 's officers the equivalent of its partners as a result of the failure of the firm to meet eds sales goals for all three years of mr ostermann 's tenure that was bad for morale several kearney officers left the firm in that period kearney now employs slightly more than 4000 people what does not work and what i think was the wrong strategic direction is to set up at kearney as a line of business integrated into eds mr klein said that approach he said eroded the perceived independence that is critical to consultants at kearney which sells management and technology advisory services in contrast eds an information technology company is a major player in the business of operating computer operations for other companies mr klein said that michael h jordan eds 's new chief executive and a former mckinsey company consultant had a good understanding of the importance of autonomy to kearney the problem for kearney consultants as employees of eds arises clearly when recommending products or services to clients said tom rodenhauser president of consulting information services a company in keene nh that tracks the consulting industry consultants generally say they want to recommend the most appropriate products regardless of who sells them as employees of eds though they also have an incentive to sell products and services of their parent company the tricky part that kearney 's going to have to deal with is what is really independence under the eds umbrella mr rodenhauser said complicating at kearney 's efforts to assert an appropriate degree of autonomy has been the uncertain economy which has also led eds to announce at least 2700 layoffs mr klein expressed some optimism that conditions would improve initially in the united states and that demand for the kind of high level strategic advice that at kearney offers would increase i believe we will have modest single digit growth probably as of next year he said mr klein is something of a throwback for kearney he joined the firm in 1982 before the acquisition by eds and his election sends a message that the firm is trying to return to those days of greater independence mr rodenhauser said dietmar ostermann was a partner after the acquisition mr rodenhauser said mr klein he continued represents the old kearney just how independent at kearney will be will depend on details that have probably not yet been worked out between the firm and eds mr rodenhauser said on paper the governance structure at kearney which is based in chicago is relatively simple mr klein will belong to a board of which mr jordan the eds chief will be chairman other directors will be eds executives or representatives elected by at kearney officers or chosen by mr klein but much will depend on how active the board is mr rodenhauser said they are still working that out he said
 to the editor re playing ambulance roulette dec 3 the writers argued that patients having heart attacks should be directly routed by ems to centers that perform urgent angioplasty we feel their conclusions may be misguided establishing that a patient is having a heart attack is not as simple as recognizing burn or trauma victims fewer than 10 percent of patients with chest pain are in fact having heart attacks of patients with heart attacks fewer than 30 percent are eligible for urgent angioplasty thus taking all patients with suspected heart attacks to angioplasty hospitals would not only affect the city 's ems structure but would also require an enormous shift in hospital resources encouraging patients to seek care earlier will do far more to reduce heart attack mortality than rerouting city ambulances to specific hospitals dr jeptha p curtis yale school of medicine new haven
 who is jim morgo kidding when he suggests that efforts to protect drinking water are preventing the construction of affordable housing the president of the long island housing partnership knows full well that long island developers simply are n't building much of it long island is one of the most overdeveloped areas in the country yet where is housing for the poor and elderly it certainly is n't the abundance of open space that has prevented the developers from building affordable housing shame on mr morgo for allowing himself to be used by the builders lobby to pretend that we ca n't have both open space and affordable housing the small amount of both commodities is strictly the fault of the developers joseph h lorintz executive director long island drinking water coalition jericho

 jason kidd wore so much ice around his right shoulder that he looked the part of a starting pitcher who had just finished a complete game and he still could not pick up the victory the nets did not sustain any significant injuries against the detroit pistons on sunday night but they received some serious scares kidd took a huge blow to his right shoulder after faking a shot and kerry kittles banged his right hip chasing a rebound in a sense the nets were fortunate to leave the palace with only a 98 84 loss already missing four regulars the nets ran out of bodies again they temporarily lost two of their best frontline players alonzo mourning and aaron williams when they picked up their fifth fouls in a span of 14 seconds in the third quarter nets coach byron scott had to call on tamar slay who had picked up four fouls in the four minutes he played in the second quarter at the time of slay 's arrival the score was tied at 68 68 from that point the pistons never trailed again outscoring the nets 30 16 mourning was particularly upset by some of the calls detroit made more free throws 25 of 33 than the nets attempted 18 of 24 i do n't expect the refs to be perfect but some games you live with them and die with them mourning said the nets did n't help themselves with their interior defense they repeatedly allowed the pistons to catch the ball near the basket and richard hamilton and corliss williamson combined to shoot 18 for 28 and score 44 points before this season the nets had not been under 500 since trading for kidd in 2001 they have now fallen under that mark twice in the past four days and will take a 3 4 record into wednesday 's game with san antonio a rematch of the nba finals we do n't feel sorry for ourselves said richard jefferson who scored 13 points for the nets but also had five fouls no one 's feeling sorry for us you do n't want to give teams like indiana and detroit confidence but they understand we 're down and this is a good time to get us the nets seem to agree that auburn hills is their least favorite stop in the eastern conference and not just because of the dearth of night life they have now dropped 17 of 18 regular season games at the palace i think we match up really well with them mourning said we 're short handed and look how we still played mourning was the first one off his seat when kidd fell hard in front of the nets bench with 10 minutes 6 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter ben wallace the pistons 6 foot 9 240 pound power forward not only bought kidd 's pump fake he also landed on kidd 's right shoulder when you try to get a big guy off his feet you pay the price said kidd who made two free throws after wallace fouled him and i did still kidd stayed in the game and played a season high 45 minutes finishing with 18 points and 11 assists scott has wanted to get kidd some rest but he is playing more than ever kittles who scored 17 points will have a hard time just putting up his feet having recently healed from a bruised thigh he collided with bob sura in the fourth quarter and followed kidd to the bench to ice his right hip kittles and kidd said they would not miss any time but it is early in the season to be playing through so many ailments in this league nagging injuries are always the worst kittles said the nets do n't have enough depth to compensate they led by 13 points in the first quarter but slay and brandon armstrong were ineffective going a combined 2 of 10 with 4 turnovers the backup point guard zoran planinic could not fill in for kidd for more than three minutes planinic a rookie from croatia talks regularly on the phone with darko milicic whom the pistons selected with the second overall pick in the draft milicic from serbia and montenegro did not leave the bench sunday they are both having trouble learning english which is essential for planinic because he shouts plays as a point guard he called and said 'i have problems with that milicic said for him it 's really hard with the language
 a rain delay of 3 hours 36 minutes preceded today 's national league division series game adding to the st louis cardinals anxiety they realized they had wasted an opportunity friday night when their bullpen blew a seventh inning lead in game 3 leaving them on the verge of elimination in the three of five game series when the rain finally ended st louis used the pitching of a rookie the power of a veteran and an unlikely home run to construct a 4 1 victory over the arizona diamondbacks at busch stadium and force a decisive game 5 on sunday we keep bouncing back and playing like champs cardinals manager tony la russa said hopefully sunday night we can do it again and be champs of something the cardinals ended the regular season with a loss at houston allowing the astros to win the central division and celebrate home field advantage in the playoffs st louis was sent to phoenix as the wild card jim edmonds growing accustomed to the postseason stage and fernando vina who normally does not hit with much power each homered and the rookie bud smith produced five taxing but effective innings for the cardinals on friday in a 5 3 defeat the cardinals were undone by craig counsell 's first career home run off a left handed pitcher today st louis shifted the series back to phoenix setting up a rematch of game 1 curt schilling threw a three hit shutout to beat matt morris 1 0 on tuesday in a matchup of baseball 's only 22 game winners morris suggested before today 's game that schilling would have trouble meeting the high standard he set last week i 'm wondering if he could pitch any better morris said it 's tough for him he 's got to go out there and throw a complete game shutout again to match his performance when the rain began this morning the cardinals were willing to wait as long as necessary to play a rainout would have allowed the diamondbacks to pitch schilling in game 4 and randy johnson in game 5 sat around bored out of my mind hoping we would play vina said vina led the offense going 3 for 3 he stole second base and scored the cardinals first run in the first inning caught smith 's pickoff throw of tony womack at second base in the third and hit a two run home run in the bottom of the inning it was no secret we had to win this game vina said i did everything i could to get the ball rolling for us smith a rookie left hander held the diamondbacks to one run on four hits and four walks in five innings leaving because of a high pitch count la russa managed this game as he has the others this series with the belief that runs were at a premium placido polanco the no 2 hitter had three sacrifice bunts tying joe tinker 's 95 year old record for a postseason game set in the 1906 world series only one of the four batters polanco advanced scored arizona 's starter albie lopez was a 19 game loser this season with tampa bay and arizona and he did not last long he left after surrendering four runs in three innings after arizona took a 1 0 lead in the first lopez allowed a run in the bottom of the inning when he was late covering first base allowing vina to score on j d drew 's infield single edmonds who homered friday night led off the second with an opposite field drive to left to make the score 2 1 the home run was edmonds 's fifth in the postseason lopez retired the next three batters before he walked smith a 160 hitter to open the third vina followed by pulling a 1 0 pitch off the netting on the right field foul pole for a two run homer vina hit nine home runs this season and has 35 in 3244 career at bats smith with the help of two relievers made vina 's blast stand up smith was not as dominant as other pitchers in this series but he sent arizona 's batters back into a funk besides the five runs they scored on friday the diamondbacks have scored one run in each of the other three games smith threw 98 pitches including 35 in the first inning and handed a 4 1 lead to dustin hermanson who threw three perfect innings steve kline recorded the save and anticipated having the celebration that the cardinals have yet to enjoy this year now it 's maybe time to go out and celebrate on somebody else 's turf he said
 scouts and coaches this week began dissecting an overflow of paperwork interviews and videotape on more than 320 college players it is their time to focus on last weekend 's combine in indianapolis now is the time when draft day decisions are in part being made this is a stretch for teams to check their homework and then check it again to begin developing their consensus for the april 15 draft and yet even after the five day combine that ended this past monday more testing is required following a trend several of the projected first round players at the combine refused to perform drills especially the 40 yard sprint most of the upper tier players enjoy that luxury want to see me run come to my campus at a later date when i am ready miami tight end bubba franks for example told the scouts and coaches that he will run for them today on the miami campus some guys who do n't want to run at the combine are injured and want to heal to run a better time said jon kingdon the raiders director of player personnel others the agents tell them do n't do it it may be 40 yards in distance any where you run it but at the combine it is a little different the guys are up early some have had their physicals the day they run it 's winter and even though you 're indoors it 's just not as ideal for some but the other side is if you can run you can run and if you can really run the scout will come to see even at your place nearly all of those expected to be drafted did arrive for the combine if only to be interviewed by the teams several players did perform and three of them really ran teams were mesmerized by the blinding speed of melvin harris a virginia cornerback he ran a 434 in the 40 yard sprint a 45 is good a 44 is wonderful a 434 is wondrous close behind were r jay soward of southern california and chris cole of texas am who ran 435 and 437 respectively soward was unusual because while he ran he was counting yelling the numbers out loud said gil brandt a draft analyst he was extremely boisterous something we had never seen before we asked him why and he told us that if he can count while running the 40 and not get to the number 19 that he knows he ran under 44 seconds now that was a twist brandt added speed is important in football and it is the skill that every team craves this draft is good at wide receiver offensive line and running back all drafts are basically the same in terms of the number of people that are going to make it but this one is different in that the first five or six drafted are pro bowl caliber players and then after that there are a lot of good players especially in the second round or from picks 7 to 50 you are going to find a contributing football player the first four players expected to be drafted include receiver peter warrick from florida state offensive tackle chris samuels from alabama and linebacker lavar arrington and defensive end courtney brown from penn state after the first four picks up and down the first round it 's wide open kingdon said the school most represented at the combine was texas am it had 10 players present florida state and virginia tech each produced 8 arkansas had 7 marshall had 5 consider that texas el paso and jackson state each featured 3 players but notre dame only 2 the tight ends were impressive three franks anthony becht from west virginia and erron kinney from florida averaged 6 feet 5 inches and 270 pounds five fullbacks weighed in at 250 pounds or more ten years ago those numbers would have been the size of offensive linemen brandt said scouts were shocked at the strength of leif larson a defensive end from texas el paso it is special if a player can bench press 225 pounds 20 times larson did it 45 times the most ever at the combine afterward though he was upset he said he had been routinely benching it 50 times in his preparation sebastian janikowski from florida state showed up in an area that is as difficult at the combine as any place kicking kingdon said you 're working with new snappers new holders but this guy did n't miss a beat he made 3 of 3 from 50 yards the ball exploded off of his foot but teams may be hesitant to draft janikowski because the polish born kicker was accused of bribing a police officer and may face deportation the star of this combine however was safety brian urlacher of new mexico he may indeed play safety in the pros but several scouts said they expect him to be moved to linebacker we list him as 6 37 8 258 pounds brandt said he ran a 46 and at that size that is remarkable he did 27 reps on the bar in my estimation he is going to be a top 10 pick he did everything at the combine and so he will probably be the only player in the top 10 who went there and showed his all urlacher weighed 253 pounds at the senior bowl a few weeks earlier but had added 5 pounds by the combine at new mexico he was a mammoth safety worked as the gunner on the punt coverage team played on other return teams and on offense caught seven passes six for touchdowns he told scouts and coaches at the combine that he has lived for draft day all of his life he 's really good kingdon said he 's flying up there as teams sift through their charts with the draft more than a month away with so many private workouts coming there is still time for others to fly and time too for others to slip and fall

 responding to a radio host 's lament that the constitution barred him from running for a third term president clinton said today that americans should vote for the next best thing by electing vice president al gore on tuesday mr clinton 's comments on a radio show broadcast hours before he arrived here for the first of several rallies aimed at persuading blacks and hispanics to vote underscored the tense nature of the relationship between the president and mr gore whose campaign has resisted using mr clinton more extensively for fear he would steal the limelight at a moment when mr gore is reciting daily that he is running as my own man late this afternoon mr clinton made a case for mr gore before a muted crowd in the predominantly black baldwin hills neighborhood in south los angeles mr clinton devoted much of his talk to a description of the successes of his own administration arguing that he had made people in watts feel they have as much say in the white house as my friends in beverly hills from there mr clinton went to visit those wealthy friends at a series of fund raisers the gore campaign has restricted mr clinton 's appearances keeping battleground states off limits for fear that the president 's arrival could alienate moderate undecided voters who are leery of casting a vote that is likely to be read as a referendum on mr clinton 's presidency that plan however has been under negotiation between the white house and the gore campaign all week and mr clinton 's precise schedule is still in flux last week the gore campaign was taken aback by the release of an interview mr clinton gave to esquire magazine in which he said republicans should apologize to the nation for impeaching him the white house said that mr clinton thought the interview would not be released until after the election there is no question that the president is far more popular among minority voters than mr gore and his appearance today on the tom joyner morning show broadcast nationwide on the abc radio networks was part of a strategy to spur a large democratic turnout for a candidate who many minority voters say leaves them cold during the interview mr joyner whose show is particularly popular among urban black audiences lamented that mr clinton could not run for a third term it would be nice if we could get four more years from you it 's been a good eight years for us mr joyner said mr clinton quickly responded but you can get the next best thing i 'll tell you we 've got to win this election and i feel very strongly that we 're going to win it if our folks vote the president has been careful not to publicly criticize the gore campaign for what he clearly views as underusing his skills on the stump his friends and colleagues however say mr clinton is ready to do a last minute battleground swing that might force the bush campaign to pour more resources into states mr clinton visits mr clinton acknowledged today that the race is virtually tied though he did not say in public what some associates say he has said in private that with the economy this good mr gore should be far ahead all these polls that show it close and show governor bush a point or two ahead all those polls are premised on an assumption that african american and hispanic voters and first generation immigrants will not vote in the same percentages that the republican base will vote mr clinton said the rally today at baldwin hills was something of an oddity mr clinton has rarely appeared at a campaign event this year that did not carry a high entry fee for the participants the event took place in a relatively new mall that was built partly by magic johnson the retired basketball star who was supposed to join mr clinton but did not appear mr clinton told the crowd of 1000 to 2000 people that mr gore understands the future how it will be shaped by the internet and the global economy but the applause was hardly spirited even when mr clinton mocked the math behind gov george w bush 's plans for spending the government surplus and one of the primary arguments mr clinton made for his vice president was somewhat negative someone has to be there if this crowd stays in control of congress he said of the republicans to stop their extremist action
 if it seemed only a few weeks ago that pete rose was hustling back into baseball 's good graces he now appears to be running in place a baseball official said yesterday that recent revelations about tax and gambling matters involving rose had slowed the process by which commissioner bud selig would determine whether to remove rose from the permanently ineligible list it has slowed down to nothing the official said rose keeps shooting himself in the foot no the heart there 's so much stuff coming out everything is being thoroughly reviewed even if rose is able to withstand the recent revelations they will apparently have some effect on his status the official said if selig reinstated rose he would place him on probation for longer than he otherwise might have perhaps two years he would want to see what comes out the official said that 's why if a deal is made and right now it 's a big big if rose would be on probation for a lot longer than a year the rose review more accurately the investigation is being conducted by martin weinstein a washington lawyer with foley lardner the firm where bob dupuy baseball 's president and chief operating officer is a partner weinstein declined to comment yesterday on the rose inquiry saying he would neither confirm nor deny it but the baseball official confirmed the involvement of weinstein a former assistant united states attorney in atlanta another official said baseball was trying to verify comments or behavior that would belie rose 's reported change in lifestyle when a bartlett giamatti then the commissioner banned rose in 1989 he said rose would have to reconfigure his life to have a chance to return to baseball fay vincent who succeeded giamatti and john dowd the washington lawyer who led the original investigation of rose and his alleged gambling said yesterday that they had spoken to weinstein several years ago the commissioner 's office in fact has been looking into the rose matter one of the officials said since he applied for reinstatement in september 1997 he came here and spent a lot of time vincent said of weinstein in a telephone interview he spent a fair amount of time with john he told john if anything he came away convinced there was more evidence since he did the investigation and that it was clear that rose bet on baseball dowd said weinstein checked out the dowd report and came to see us when he was done adding in a telephone interview he had some minor questions but fully agreed with everything we came up with dowd said thomas ostertag baseball 's general counsel joined weinstein at the meeting which he said lasted about half the day weinstein is looking into reports that have surfaced in the last eight weeks since selig 's nov 25 meeting with rose in milwaukee became known his continuing behavior makes it more complicated one official said the commissioner 's office the official said has mixed feelings about the meeting becoming public on one hand selig 's aides had hoped their deliberations could continue in secret but on the other the disclosure has produced reports that they would rather check out now than after reinstatement a major concern of selig and his aides is that damaging information on rose could emerge after his reinstatement less than two weeks after the milwaukee meeting became known the dayton daily news received a copy of a tape recording that was said to have been made in 1986 by a man described as a dayton gambling kingpin with close ties to the mafia the conversation on the tape dealt with rose 's gambling debts last month the cincinnati enquirer reported that the internal revenue service had placed a 151690 lien on rose 's property in california for taxes he owed from 1998 baseball could see an inability to pay taxes as a potential problem for rose a reason for him to gamble to try to make more money other reports have told of rose sightings at casinos in las vegas that 's the sort of thing weinstein will focus on gambling at las vegas casinos is legal but it is not an activity that would demonstrate to selig that rose has altered his lifestyle weinstein was also said to have recently interviewed tommy gioiosa once a rose roommate who has previously told about rose 's betting and other illegal activity selig has made it clear to rose that if he were to be reinstated he would have to admit that he bet on baseball an act he has denied for 13 1 2 years since he was banned from baseball one official said one of rose 's representatives told dupuy about a year ago that rose was prepared to make that admission weinstein served in the justice department in washington and with the united states attorney 's office in atlanta from 1988 to 1996 he then joined foley lardner where he is now head of the compliance counseling and government enforcement group baseball correction february 6 2003 thursday a sports article on tuesday about pete rose 's quest to be reinstated by major league baseball referred incorrectly to the role played by tommy gioiosa a former roommate of his in revealing information about mr rose 's gambling activities while mr gioiosa has spoken about those activities in a magazine interview he was never interviewed by martin weinstein a washington lawyer hired by commissioner bud selig to conduct an investigation of mr rose
 more parts are officially peeling away from the yankees we knew about paul o'neill and luis sojo going home and staying home we figured that scott brosius tino martinez and chuck knoblauch would play elsewhere next season we realized that orlando hernandez might be given a new baseball address too but when these departures actually occur they can still cause a jolt joe torre made it obvious that the yankees did not want brosius two days after luis gonzalez 's 150 foot hit ended a dynasty and brosius made it just as obvious that he did not want to play anymore when he decided to retire that brosius will not play for the yankees in 2002 is no surprise that the 35 year old third baseman will be camping with his three children and not playing anywhere is since jason giambi will surely saunter through the same door brosius just strolled out of with about 120 million in his pocket some of the mystery about how the yankees will look next season will be solved giambi a hulking first baseman will provide an awesome combination of power and patience that the yankees have never had under torre the changes are necessary even if the yankees had won their fourth straight world series title these changes would have come o'neill never wavered even when there were whispers that he should push his body through another season sojo joked that it would take a 5 million contract for him to return martinez sold his house in tenafly because he knew what was looming before game 5 against the arizona diamondbacks brosius and knoblauch discussed ending their yankees careers with a fourth championship in four years it did not happen of course and now the yankees are making their greatest overhaul since 1996 as of today the yankees do not have confirmed starters at first base third base left field right field or in the final two spots in the rotation brosius retired because he wanted to spend more time with his family but he admitted that the myriad changes on the yankees told him it was time to depart too there 's a ton of things that go into the decision brosius said yesterday that certainly was a factor the team looks like it 's going to change its personality a bit but again those are all little things that come into play the no 1 factor for me was knowing myself i was just ready to start pursuing other things in a telephone conversation with torre brosius mentioned how the yankees were going in another direction and how it was his time to retire he talked about how we were going to have a different look said torre you have such fond memories of what you 've done here that you might want to leave with that i 'm sure that had something to do with it the yankees are preparing for the next era the giambi era o'neill talked about how the group that won four of the last six championships had its run and now it is over but the yankees o'neill said the yankees of derek jeter bernie williams mariano rivera andy pettitte roger clemens mike mussina jorge posada mike stanton and ramiro mendoza will stay formidable some of the other names will change add giambi and subtract martinez maybe add cliff floyd add a reliable starter and hernandez can be moved some of the names had to change for the yankees to improve listening to brosius talk about retirement was listening to a man at peace brosius sounded almost positive about retiring after the season and feeling what he needed to feel the first time he attended mass in mcminnville ore this was where he needed to be for moments like yesterday 's his children who were not allowed to have pets while the family kept two residences were giddy about getting a puppy still even brosius the family man hedged slightly about departing there was nothing left for him to chase brosius said but if the yankees had kept their dynasty cruising and were chasing a fifth straight title brosius 's kids might have had to wait for a puppy this decision was more personal than it was circumstances said brosius obviously if we would have won the series and there had been a commitment to try to keep everybody together for one more crack at it i think it might have been a little tougher to make that decision the circumstances and the yankees helped make it easier for brosius giambi is coming nick johnson will be a weapon floyd could be in left field brosius and others are gone brosius felt the season was not supposed to end with a loss and said we were supposed to ride off into the sunset after winning another title that is how george steinbrenner always feels that is why there will be plenty of new parts on an already strong team

 the nets kenyon martin the top overall pick of the 2000 draft did not think about the sharp teeth digging into his shooting hand today instead being the dutiful rookie he fed bananas to the whiskered bearcat the mascot of his alma mater the university of cincinnati and posed for a photo meanwhile a hall of famer from cincinnati oscar robertson looked on in amusement the nets brought robertson in too to lend a festive if not circus like atmosphere to an afternoon infused with optimism by the end the bearcat was eating grapes out of martin 's hand store that image for the future if martin 's bold goals come true in his rookie season the only goal i set for myself is to make the all nba defensive first team said the 6 foot 9 martin who will switch with keith van horn at small and power forward this season martin wants that honor more than rookie of the year because it 's never happened before he said i strive for defense said martin who was conference usa defensive player of the year three times that 's what separates me from a lot of people his soft spoken words resonated on the eve of training camp at the champion center his veteran teammates returning from years of injury and coaching changes were optimistic point guard stephon marbury thought martin 's goal best typified the new nets philosophy he gets big stars for that because the mentality from everyone here is defense marbury said but if martin was the somewhat embarrassed focus today he was certainly not the show unequivocally the new head coach byron scott winner of three national basketball association titles with the lakers and a protege of pat riley and larry brown will run the show because of scott the veterans expect immediate improvement over last season 's 31 51 finish under don casey success comes from the no 1 position and that 's the head coach van horn said last year i think at a lot of times we lacked direction at that position he seems very disciplined comes from a long line of discipline coaches van horn said of scott he 's been on disciplined teams that have won and i hope that will transfer to our court if you put that with our talent level within a great structure a great system and a great coach you can win marbury having fine tuned his shot with scott this summer preached the new feeling it 's totally different not even close marbury said you 're playing for someone who has won championships practiced like a champion you have that person leading you good things are going to happen after scott martin is the key his right leg which he fractured in march has completely healed and he has impressed both marbury and van horn in pickup games i never saw him wince i never saw him flinch van horn said out of all the games i 've never seen kenyon quit once we lacked energy without jayson williams last year kenyon is not jayson but they have the same type of energy his presence is going to be able to help the team one player was not present today shooting guard kendall gill who signed a 7 million one year contract this summer missed media day but arrived in time for tonight 's team meeting a last minute arrangement other free agent acquisitions the 6 9 forward aaron williams and a re signed johnny newman seemed comfortable with their key reserve roles jim mcilvaine evan eschmeyer and jamie feick fitter than ever are prepared to split time at center about the only player not happy to be in uniform today was a limping shooting guard kerry kittles who is out indefinitely it 's a tease he said it 's a bummer i ca n't get ready to play with them tomorrow because this system would really fit me instead kittles will spend some or all of the season rehabilitating from a rare surgery that took bone pieces from his knee and filled holes in the bones of his femur still he might be pleased to be on the sideline tomorrow they 're going to be sore they 're going to be dying scott promised i want to be the best conditioned team in the league he has another goal i know we only won 31 games last year and if we win 40 this year it will probably be considered a success he said still to me we make the playoffs and we 'll be successful martin 's team first attitude is the hallmark of that success scott said adding it makes me feel very good that he wants to be a great defensive player because that 's where we 're heading anyway
 somehow princeton always seems to win its close games in the ncaa men 's lacrosse tournament it won its four previous ncaa games including last year 's final by one goal of its 11 previous ncaa games decided by one goal it won them all today the tigers did it again in their quarterfinal game they let a five goal lead slip away as georgetown tied the score on walid hajj 's goal with 44 seconds left no problem ryan boyle of princeton fired in a shot from 5 yards with four seconds left and the tigers exhaled with a 14 13 victory in the first game of the doubleheader syracuse ran off five consecutive goals in seven minutes in the first quarter then held off duke 10 9 the victories put princeton 9 4 and syracuse 13 2 into the national semifinals at rutgers for georgetown 12 3 and duke 8 7 the season has ended two more quarterfinal games will be played sunday in baltimore with johns hopkins 11 1 against massachusetts 12 3 and virginia 10 3 facing cornell 11 3 saturday 's semifinals will send princeton against the johns hopkins massachusetts winner and syracuse against the virginia cornell winner the final is may 27 johns hopkins is seeded first syracuse second virginia third and princeton fourth a nasty overnight rain stopped in time for today 's games but the 47 degree temperature and winds of 23 miles an hour seemed more appropriate for polar bear swimming than lacrosse still 5561 hardy souls many of them high school or youth soccer players wearing appropriate jackets turned out at hofstra stadium as coach mike pressler of duke said people got their money 's worth princeton and georgetown seemed headed for overtime which would have been especially dangerous for the tigers because the hoyas had momentum even when princeton had possession and called a timeout with 13 seconds left in regulation overtime seemed assured princeton set up a play but as coach bill tierney said as usual what we planned did n't work so the tigers tried another way to pick off a defender to free a shooter it worked dan clark set a pick for boyle but another defender picked up boyle then owen daly set a pick and as boyle said when i felt the defender 's stick go over my head i knew i was going to get an open shot and i knew i had plenty of time the shot meant no overtime and ended a season in which georgetown 's only losses came to massachusetts by three goals syracuse by one and princeton by one when the game was over the georgetown players stood frozen on the field in frustration midfielder steve dusseau georgetown 's best player said as a senior it 's tough to lose your last game by one goal dusseau was held to one goal and one assist but he will have other opportunities he has been chosen for the united states team for the world championships in july and he is graduating with a degree in psychology for years syracuse and princeton have made their marks in this sport syracuse has reached the final four for the 20th consecutive year and as coach john desko said if you can do anything 20 times in a row you 're doing ok princeton has won 6 of the last 10 national titles and eight straight ivy league championships syracuse seemed thankful to have survived a duke team that had the advantage on face offs 20 of 23 shots on goal 23 to 19 and ground balls 47 to 20 unlike georgetown syracuse escaped a last minute onslaught with 1 minute 29 seconds left syracuse was penalized and duke 's pressler gave his team a play we wanted a pick play for kevin cassese pressler said we went to our best guy and it did n't work out with 44 seconds left cassese got off a shot solid but wide twenty seconds later with the penalty over dan chemotti tried to shoot but john glatzel of syracuse tipped the ball off chemotti 's stick pressler spoke with pride for his underrated atlantic coast conference champions saying we stood toe to toe with the team i consider the best in the game today
 at halftime of the nets game against the detroit pistons on thursday night jamie feick was sitting in the locker room when the first half statistics were passed around he had 19 rebounds the nets began to urge their teammate on yelling for him to go for 30 or 40 boards and perhaps etch his name into the record book for feick the 19 rebounds meant something else it assured him that he would be on the floor for the second half feick whose minutes have gone up and down like a roller coaster recently wanted to play and help his team to win when the game was over he had 25 rebounds including the final one of the night when he grabbed a missed shot by pistons guard lindsey hunter to secure the nets 122 120 victory after playing only eight minutes against the knicks the previous night feick had accomplished his mission and earned a start on saturday afternoon when the nets play host to the dallas mavericks i try not to get caught up in it feick said after practice today at the champion center people were saying 'come on get 30 or 40 the main thing was to win the game and that 's what we did the 25 rebounds were the third highest total in nets history buck williams holds the record with 27 although that occurred during a four overtime game on the season feick ranks fifth in the national basketball association with 117 rebounds a game finding his name among such players as shaquille o'neal dikembe mutombo tim duncan and kevin garnett in offensive rebounds feick ranks third behind chicago 's elton brand and o'neal but feick remains an afterthought in the league a player who is more often than not referred to by name the pistons alvin gentry did just that after the game when he said that one guy outrebounded our entire team in the first half feick said i think i 'm kind of a dark horse i like that i like to maybe sneak up and come out of nowhere people do n't expect a lot from me i like that that would be a good name for me dark horse while feick may enjoy his lack of status among the opposition he is not quite so happy when his own coaches think of him that way despite his numbers his minutes have soared up and down nets coach don casey played jim mcilvaine against patrick ewing on wednesday and the coach attributes the fluctuations in feick 's minutes to the nets depth of big men but feick also endured a 23 minute four rebound night on monday against the philadelphia 76ers after averaging 30 minutes and 127 rebounds a game in the three games before that even after signing a seven year deal with the nets this summer the not too distant memory of trying to stick through a 10 day contract keeps him wishing for more stability we just feel that we 'll still be manning the center by committee casey said the way he came off last night 's game was important if someone is too big for him the reaction ca n't be 'what 's going on patrick ewing has not player in the last quarter of three games that 's what the league is evolving into feick said sometimes coach does things for matchup purposes maybe he did n't feel i was the best person for our team in the game at that time it 's frustrating because you want to be part of the action all the time the only thing i can control is when he does put me in to play as hard as i can play feick would like more recognition around the league and sees the national basketball association 's sixth man award as a way out of the darkness eventually i would like to come out of the dark horse stereotype feick said i like being the dark horse people do n't expect as much from you and maybe there 's less pressure rebounds sherman douglas underwent surgery friday to repair a lesion on his left ankle he will have to stay off the ankle six to eight weeks and then begin rehabilitation the nets activated gheorghe muresan on friday and placed michael cage on the injured list with a sprained toe muresan who had torn cartilage in his knee surgically repaired on dec 15 participated in light drills friday and was not expected to be ready to play just yet we 're going to take gheorghe on the road trip to work him out casey said he got clearance to work out i wo n't say with restrictions but with monitoring

 phillies manager larry bowa sat back in the recliner in his office at veterans stadium on friday tearing through a bag of potato chips and watching a cable news channel the game against the mets was more than an hour away and bowa was experiencing a rare moment of tranquility in the storm that always seems to circulate around him and lately his team bowa who was the phillies shortstop for 16 years is possibly the most popular baseball personality in town and his on field tantrums earn cheers that rival those for home runs he was hired three years ago to bring emotion to the phillies after seven consecutive losing seasons and he is flashing it now as reliever dan plesac said he means well but he has his days bowa seems a perfect fit for philadelphia whose fans often thrive on negativity when closer jose mesa entered thursday 's game against the mets to protect a one run ninth inning lead he was booed as he jogged from the bullpen mesa then allowed a leadoff home run to the rookie prentice redman the phillies won in the bottom of the ninth inning though and again in their final at bat friday five runs in the fifth inning tonight forced mets starter jeremy griffiths from the game and led the phillies to a 9 6 victory their eighth in nine games griffiths 1 2 allowed seven runs in four and two thirds innings after holding the atlanta braves to two runs in six and a third innings in his last start mesa lost his closer 's job on friday the former met turk wendell got the save tonight also friday florida marlins manager jack mckeon said bowa was panicking this must be bash larry week bowa told philadelphia reporters today bowa has been ejected from six games this season but he has had clubhouse outbursts more often the latest came on aug 28 after a 4 0 loss to montreal the phillies ninth loss in 10 games on the road the players then held a meeting on the team bus by some reports the team decided it would win to prove bowa wrong plesac said the meeting had little to do with bowa and focused on turning things around immediately i 'm sure there 's four or five guys out there that some of the moves i make they do n't like bowa said on friday i ca n't worry about that i have to worry about 25 guys bowa said that was the first air out meeting he had had all year and that he was entitled to one we 've had larry bowa speeches the whole year catcher mike lieberthal said we 've had his blowups so i do n't think there 's anything different other than the point in the season and every game is important the phillies responded with a three game sweep of the mets in new york and more controversy pat burrell in a season long slump homered in the first game and bypassed bowa upon returning to the dugout the next day the phillies released the reserve tyler houston who had been close to burrell houston later told a philadelphia reporter about the players meeting and said bowa did not care about his players bowa in turn called houston a loser general manager ed wade said houston was released because he had been unhappy with his role and was trying to undermine the team the consensus among players and management is that the august swoon was an aberration opinions though differed on what effect either bowa 's or the players meeting had plesac and the reserve catcher todd pratt said the team 's resulting play was a combination of both lieberthal credited good pitching bowa does not want to make more enemies i do n't want any credit he said they 're the ones playing when i had my meeting i just wanted to get a couple of things off my chest controversy has threatened to torpedo the playoff hopes of the phillies but the phillies are a game ahead of the florida marlins for the wild card with five other teams within six and a half games of the phillies the winner lieberthal said will be the team that gets hot and lucky the phillies seem to be both and pratt sees similarities to his former team the mets who went into september slides in 1999 and 2000 before going deep into the postseason some of those difficult times made us stronger at the end pratt said i think that 's happening now the phillies want to bring a winner into the new ballpark next door they used the projected revenues on last year 's free agent class third baseman david bell has missed much of this season because of a back injury but first baseman jim thome has 39 home runs and 107 runs batted in kevin millwood who was acquired in a trade has been the phillies ace but can become a free agent after the season wade 's attempts to sign him to an extension have so far failed several relievers may also leave but most of the starters and position players are signed for next year the plan though is to win now i think everybody here thinks that we should be the team lieberthal said everybody here feels we have the most talented team we 've got the veteran players and we know the potential which we 've never really hit all year

 jason kidd wore the souvenirs of the nets western conference trip on his knees scabs and bruises of varying shades of purple that he had collected on five courts victories against the los angeles lakers and the denver nuggets helped to salve the wounds of defeats in the first three games of the trip but kidd earned a brighter badge yesterday for the second straight season he was the only nets player named as a reserve to the eastern conference all star team it will be his sixth appearance in nine seasons nets coach byron scott had hoped the other conference coaches would also choose kenyon martin as a reserve six teams will have more than one representative i do n't think it says anything bad about our team said scott whose nets 30 14 are in first place in the atlantic division kidd was looking forward to going to atlanta for the all star game on feb 9 instead of taking the time to relax that is time off kidd said monday night anticipating his selection it 's great it 's just a goal i work for every time in the summer to be considered one of the best players in the league kidd who was the runner up to tim duncan as the nba 's most valuable player last season dedicated himself to improving his shooting it seems to have helped kidd a point guard who will be a free agent after this season is averaging 204 points and shooting 44 percent from the floor better than his career averages of 142 points and 403 percent kidd who scored a season high 41 points last thursday in his oakland homecoming against golden state totaled 101 points in the three road losses martin a third year forward leads the nets in rebounding 84 a game and is third in scoring 143 points behind kidd and richard jefferson 152 who will be participating in the slam dunk contest during all star weekend martin 's rocky start on the trip both mirrored and affected the nets in the nets loss to utah on jan 20 he shot 2 for 10 before fouling out with six minutes remaining in regulation martin was not under the basket to defend karl malone who scored on a last second put back to send the game into overtime in the next game martin guarded sacramento 's chris webber who scored a game high 36 points as the kings won although martin did have 17 points and 13 rebounds martin shot 4 for 21 in the loss to golden state we were in every game we just did n't pull it out in the end martin said we learned from that and did n't let it linger on though he continued to shoot poorly last friday against the lakers martin persevered scoring 18 points late in the game he hit a clutch jumper made two free throws and had a game clinching dunk he had 17 points and 9 rebounds in monday 's 92 66 rout in denver martin said he was not expecting to be an all star and added that he would gladly take the four day break as far away from america as possible the nets have five games remaining before the all star game break they play at home tonight against washington and friday against new orleans before a game at detroit on saturday now all we have to do is start looking forward scott said the toughest part of our schedule is pretty much behind us before the all star break we want to make sure we get a nice little roll going michael jordan will probably make his last regular season appearance at continental arena tonight the wizards are 22 23 after monday 's victory over phoenix jordan averaging 182 points a game will make his 14th all star appearance his first as a reserve i think when he leaves the game i 'm going to remember him as a bull scott said i 'm not going to remember him as a wizard the things he achieved in chicago i do n't think two years in washington is going to tarnish that scott is trying not to envision kidd in a different uniform next season he said he also does not consider how everything the nets do may affect kidd 's decision to stay or go no maybe i should but it really does n't enter my mind scott said all i 'm thinking about is winning games i do n't go into the game saying we got to win this game or we got to do this to keep jason i just ca n't think like that

 there are physical maulings and then there is what giants defensive end michael strahan did for much of yesterday afternoon against st louis offensive tackle ryan tucker strahan has an assortment of moves but right now his best one seems to be the all out bull rush it is a pure power move in which the massive strahan uses brute strength to shove his opponent backward strahan overpowered the 305 pound tucker so badly once that he almost bumped into quarterback kurt warner pushed like a plate of food across the dinner table warner was nearly knocked down without strahan 's even touching him in the second half the rams began sending two players to block strahan hoping a double team would finally stop him from disrupting their pretty offense still strahan wreaked havoc once stripping warner of the football strahan who had the single best day for a defensive lineman in the nfl thus far this season with six tackles four sacks one pass knocked down and one forced fumble exemplified the giants relentlessness in all phases of the game giants players punished rams players on the giants first possession ron dayne ran over free safety kim herring as if the 200 pound defensive back were a lilliputian warner was not tackled he was pounded all game marshall faulk whose quickness is normally like armor against big hits was hit hard once by safety sam garnes and another time by linebacker mike barrow who forced a fumble guard glenn parker steamrolled safety adam archuleta while pulling on a running play this past week giants coaches and players talked about one thing when preparing for the rams nuclear offense let 's try to physically intimidate them yeah that was an intense game said tucker who played with a broken hand and an injured shoulder the giants have a good defense and they were doing some serious hitting warner was sacked 6 times and hit 16 times by late in the second half he was visibly flustered faulk who is probably the best player in the sport wobbled off the field late in the third quarter after being hit by nine giants almost at once forcing him to fumble he sustained a bone bruise in his right knee did not play in the fourth quarter and will miss next week 's game against the jets then strahan and kenny holmes knocked warner out of the game in the fourth quarter with a combined hit which knocked the wind out of him even the giants coaches got into the act when cornerback dexter mccleon was doing a little too much trash talking near the giants sideline the linebackers coach tom olivadotti screamed at him to shut up olivadotti later had to be restrained by another assistant charles way after he began yelling at an official after the controversial pass interference penalty against garnes that led to the rams winning score st louis did win 15 14 but in many ways this was a victory for the giants because their hard fought effort may have dispelled what seemed to be constant whispers by other teams that they are overrated i get tired of what people say about us coach jim fassel said strahan said this defense is getting better and more confident every week no one gave us a chance because their offense is so high powered but our defense is n't bad either it has been some time since the giants physically dominated a super bowl contender this way on the road john fox 's schemes were brilliant as usual limiting the rams to 41 yards rushing and 87 fewer total yards than their 402 yard average but it was the attitude of the giants players that almost won this game that attitude became more stubborn with each hit with each rams star sent limping off in two games against st louis the past two seasons the giants had been beaten by 69 34 and gave up 809 yards then they did not have the talent or the attitude to keep up with the rams this time the giants had both and decided to do the bullying especially strahan when asked what he thought of the play of the giants defense warner replied way too much strahan strahan 's abuse of the rams continued after the game tucker did give strahan credit for being a good player but then suggested that strahan had beaten him so badly because of his injuries in the nfl nothing gets a player more fired up than hearing another player make excuses told of tucker 's remarks strahan said well maybe we 'll meet down the road and he 'll be healthy then let 's see what happens

 the knicks and the denver nuggets are discussing a trade that would feature marcus camby and nuggets point guard nick van exel as the key components according to a person with knowledge of denver 's negotiations no offers have been made but the teams are discussing two scenarios the first would send camby and guard mark jackson to denver for van exel and james posey an athletic 6 foot 8 swingman the other would bring van exel and the versatile 6 foot 11 raef lafrentz to new york for camby jackson another player perhaps center travis knight or center felton spencer might have to be thrown in to make it work under the rules of the league 's collective bargaining agreement the knicks are believed to prefer the second deal while the nuggets favor the first scott layden the knicks general manager could not be reached for comment with the feb 21 trade deadline approaching the nuggets are mulling over several potential deals for van exel the talented but disgruntled point guard who has asked to be traded three teams the knicks the minnesota timberwolves and the toronto raptors appear to be the most aggressive suitors the most likely trade at this point is believed to be van exel to minnesota for timberwolves point guard terrell brandon denver 's general manager kiki vandeweghe believes brandon and antonio mcdyess the nuggets all star forward would work well together the nuggets have also talked with toronto about trading van exel for forward jerome williams and point guard chris childs the former knick but toronto general manager glen grunwald said yesterday that he did not foresee a deal we 've talked to denver grunwald said but i do n't think we have anything going with them it seems unlikely that the knicks who play tonight at orlando would trade camby a 6 11 forward and jackson for van exel and posey because they would not be receiving a big man in return they would perhaps want to replace posey in the deal with the 6 10 center scott williams but the other scenario might be too lopsided in the knicks favor jackson could not come close to replacing the scoring and speed of van exel and while camby has done more in the league than lafrentz his history of injury makes him undependable he is currently out for the rest of the month with a bruise and torn muscle in his right hip if the knicks obtain van exel without giving up either of their perimeter stars latrell sprewell and allan houston they will almost certainly begin playing a different style they will be a near mirror image of the milwaukee bucks one of the eastern conference favorites and the current leaders of the central division van exel houston and sprewell all average more than 18 points a game and would be every bit as good as milwaukee 's big three of sam cassell ray allen and glenn robinson even without camby the knicks frontcourt of kurt thomas clarence weatherspoon and othella harrington would be nearly as strong as milwaukee 's if the knicks obtained lafrentz the league 's second leading shot blocker it might be even better lafrentz averages 14 points 7 rebounds and 3 blocked shots a game he is a solid position defender inside as opposed to camby who blocks shots while coming over from the weak side lafrentz who is in his fourth season is also the nuggets second leading 3 point shooter behind van exel a trade involving van exel and camby would be the boldest move of layden 's 10 year career as a general manager in utah and new york and would perhaps show how pressured he feels by the freefall of the knicks 19 28 though he is only in the third year of a seven year deal worth 15 million to 20 million layden may need to pull off something big to save his job past this season while the knicks would have interest in obtaining charles oakley if he is waived by chicago their chances of landing him might be slim oakley would certainly want to play for a playoff bound team and his friendship with michael jordan would make the resurgent washington wizards a more likely candidate orlando would also have interest in oakley and with his former knicks teammates doc rivers and patrick ewing in orlando the magic would have a strong shot as well

 the scoreboard operator welcomed the mets back to shea stadium by playing the memorable scene in which dorothy finally gets to go home in the wizard of oz there was judy garland her eyes closed sweetly and hopefully saying there 's no place like home but the mets did not prove that last night being home felt much like being on the road again for the mets in their troubling 6 4 defeat to the marlins it was another game in which they could not beat ryan dempster in which one of their starters put them in too deep a hole in which they did not produce in crucial situations and in which surprise surprise rickey henderson failed to hustle and created a new controversy so even though the mets were back at shea stadium the developments and the results were quite similar to those from their grueling and sluggish 5 8 road trip the mets were still searching for consistency when they returned to flushing but they did not find any as the marlins destroyed glendon rusch in coasting to a six run cushion before hanging on for the victory henderson coasted in the first by going into his home run trot prematurely perhaps costing the mets a run and making himself look silly when he was held to a single after the ball hit off the fence the 30828 fans at shea showered henderson with boos for the rest of the night and manager bobby valentine reprimanded the embattled leadoff hitter who was placed on waivers this week i told him it was not acceptable an angry valentine said hit it 400 feet before you pull that it might have been a different story if we had gotten off to a quick lead but valentine 's words apparently did not influence henderson who called questions about his trot ridiculous and who was noticeably tense as he sparred with reporters henderson said that it did n't matter that valentine criticized his behavior and defiantly said that he would not change i 'm going to do it again if i hit one like that henderson said does that answer your question i 've been doing it all my life ai n't nothing going to change about it the most exasperating thing about henderson for the mets is that he can still be an effective catalyst with the mets trailing by 6 0 in the fifth he walked stole second and scored on derek bell 's ground rule double mike piazza followed with a two run homer into the right field corner and robin ventura smashed dempster 's next pitch into the right field bullpen suddenly the score was 6 4 and the mets had life henderson walked and bell doubled off dempster with one out in the sixth but piazza and ventura both struck out the mets also stranded the potential tying runs in the eighth when piazza tapped out to first they finished 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position rusch had allowed two or fewer earned runs in four of his five starts as a pleasant surprise in the rotation but he was ineffective last night the marlins did not just get 12 hits off rusch they hit rockets off him preston wilson ripped a three run homer and derrek lee hammered a shot over the picnic area in left in a four run fifth that made it 6 0 henderson began the first by lining dempster 's second pitch to left field but henderson quickly turned a positive into a negative in rickeyesque fashion henderson flipped his bat aside put his head down and started a home run trot the only problem was that the ball hit off the bottom of the fence by the time henderson jogged to first cliff floyd had already fielded the carom henderson 's lack of hustle impacted the inning instead of having a runner on second base with no outs the mets only had a runner on first against a pitcher who threw a one hitter against them six days ago henderson took second on bell 's hit and run grounder but piazza and ventura failed to knock him in it was an awful way to start a homestand according to everyone except henderson i should n't have been running no harder than i ran henderson said i thought the ball was out of the ballpark that 's it no i should n't have run no harder but henderson did run harder when he popped to left in the third and for the rest of the night still henderson 's late hustle was too late for the mets who would have been much happier to be back home if rickey had run and they had won it was n't an act of not hustling valentine said about henderson it was an act of misjudgment that was n't a good looking act that 's for sure inside pitch melvin mora cut the tip of his right index finger while bunting for a hit required four stitches and was placed on the disabled list after the game joe mcewing a utility player was recalled from class aaa norfolk edgardo alfonzo did not start because of a sore right calf but he entered the game after mora 's injury pat mahomes will start today 's game

 an influential expert on global warming who for nearly 20 years has pressed countries to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat trapping gases now says the emphasis on carbon dioxide may be misplaced instead he and a team of scientists have concluded that the quickest way to slow warming is to cut other such greenhouse gases first this strategy could help policy makers overcome a fundamental conflict in the debate over global warming carbon dioxide the main heat trapping gas in the air is an unavoidable byproduct of burning fossil fuels like coal and oil and combustion of fossil fuels is the foundation of industrial societies the expert dr james e hansen and his colleagues conclude in a new analysis that the warming seen in recent decades has been caused mainly by other heat trapping emissions methane chlorofluorocarbons black particles of diesel and coal soot and compounds that create the ozone in smog which are easier to control than carbon dioxide with many of them already on the decline the team which reported its findings this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences found that the burning of fossil fuels although substantially raising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere also produces a pall of particle haze that reflects as much of the sun 's energy back into space as the release of carbon dioxide has trapped in the air dr hansen said the haze from combustion is likely to be cleaned up in coming years removing its cooling sun blocking effect said dr hansen who is director of nasa 's goddard institute for space studies and over the course of the century he added carbon dioxide levels will still have to be reduced to prevent further warming meanwhile emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities may be decreasing he said they shrank slightly in 1998 and 1999 even as the global economy grew as a result he said the world may find it easier and less costly to slow climate change than he and other scientists had thought at least in the short term the prospects for having a modest climate impact instead of a disastrous one are quite good i think dr hansen said in an interview some climatologists greeted dr hansen 's new paper with dismay saying they feared it would be misused by skeptics about global warming or by critics of a proposed treaty the kyoto protocol which would commit industrialized nations to big cuts in greenhouse gas emissions representatives of industries most vulnerable to restrictions on carbon dioxide welcomed the findings saying they raised provocative questions about the need for vigorous action on the climate the strong reaction is largely a function of the major role that dr hansen has played in propelling the greenhouse debate onto the public stage in 1981 he was a principal author of one of the first papers spelling out the links between rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and rising global temperatures in 1988 when a scorching american heat wave was at its peak and fires were consuming the amazon he testified before a senate committee that human activities were changing the climate in the analysis dr hansen and his colleagues culled data and scientific papers on topics from rice production which releases methane to urban pollution a source of ozone and sooty particles to obtain detailed estimates of the rate of change in different greenhouse emissions he then used established formulas for calculating how different amounts of the gases in the future would affect the inflow of energy from the sun and escape of heat from the earth carbon dioxide is by far the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere but the other gases dr hansen and his team cite are more prodigious trappers of heat moreover dr hansen said in contrast to the difficulties of controlling carbon dioxide technologies already exist for capturing or eliminating many of the other kinds of emissions these are much more tractable dr hansen said citing as an example existing systems for capturing methane produced by decomposing organic material in landfills also because many of these gases cause serious costly health problems or can harm agriculture there are strong economic reasons for wanting to eliminate them he said some scientists criticized aspects of the new study but agreed that an initial focus on the other greenhouse gases could achieve significant slowing of climate warming as long as carbon dioxide cuts were also made dr john p holdren a professor of environmental science and public policy at harvard university said any focus on cutting just one set of gases now would be a mistake this is not an either or problem dr holdren said it 's a both and problem we 're going to need all the cuts we can get the paper has prompted a significant amount of scrambling by scientists and lobbyists who are trying to shape the response to global warming several hundred scientists in dozens of countries are working on final revisions to the latest installment of a united nations assessment of climate change it also comes as the presidential candidates are being pressed by private environmental groups to add more detail to their positions on global warming vice president al gore has frequently cited dr hansen 's work in 1997 mr gore played a major role in negotiations in kyoto japan on the proposed treaty the white house said yesterday that the kyoto plan was the best approach to slowing warming adding that it placed equal emphasis on reducing all of the greenhouse gases largely because of insistence by american negotiators including the vice president gov george w bush of texas has said the kyoto proposals were inadequate and unfair to the united states a spokesman for the bush campaign ray sullivan yesterday called the new hansen paper intriguing adding that there were still questions to be answered dr robert t watson the chairman of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change said he had received a flurry of phone calls from other scientists in the last few days expressing worries that dr hansen 's study could be misportrayed they said this could easily be interpreted as the guy who got vice president gore all excited about global warming now saying everything 's fine dr watson said adding if this paper is viewed that way it 'd be a horrible distortion if anything our projections for warming are higher than they used to be and we 're seeing discernible changes in ecosystems that we can link back to climate representatives of industries that have sought to limit restrictions on fossil fuels said the paper poked provocative holes in the science behind the kyoto plan and other proposals to stem warming dr hansen stressed that he is still convinced that global warming is under way that people are a significant cause and that work should be done to cut the rate of change perhaps not quite as much work as researchers thought

 when a significant figure dies somebody somewhere will inevitably invoke that hackneyed phrase the end of an era and while most of us wo n't know exactly what ended we will be dutifully impressed edward logue the bold master planner who died jan 27 in his home on martha 's vineyard at the age of 78 would probably have scoffed at cosmic language about his role in life but in fact he did represent a way of doing things that is long gone as is the generous era that allowed him to realize his big visions and do what he did best rebuild cities as saturday 's memorial service for him in boston reminded us there really could not be an ed logue today he was a powerful headstrong urban planner in the 1950 's and 60 's who figuring out how to grab every available penny of urban renewal money remember urban renewal reshaped new haven and boston then put his talents to work in new york in the late 70 's and 80 's as head of the state 's urban development corporation from 1968 to 1975 he built housing stadiums and more housing from buffalo to roosevelt island working free of local zoning and building rules thanks to his powerful mentor nelson a rockefeller and using federal and state largess as his checkbook today urban renewal means donald trump building towers of affluence on the hudson and east rivers federal dollars that built thousands of apartments for the poor and middle class have all but dried up we have no national housing policy that 's worth a damn in my view mr logue said three years ago when the country was already scornful of big government the munificence of the new deal and great society ed played those federal housing grant programs like a zither recalled stephen lefkowitz a lawyer who worked for the state he did what he wanted to do and trusted that the lord would make it work the lord and some optimistic accounting instead of financing each project individually securing the money before beginning construction mr logue would get financing for one project and start three there was always more money on the way and then in 1975 the government put a freeze on federal housing subsidies the banks called in outstanding loans and the urban development corporation went bankrupt mr logue was fired and did n't make his new york comeback until 1978 when mayor edward i koch brought him back to rebuild the south bronx a national symbol of urban decline he went way over budget as he turned the south bronx 's infamous charlotte street into charlotte gardens a new community of private homes the original idea was to build a large apartment building but mr logue thought home ownership was a better idea and while negotiating the political shoals of the bronx he built 90 subsidized homes as we were getting dragged in i was saying to myself 'what am i getting into mr koch recalled but it was the best thing we could have done it anchored the community charlotte street has come back and swaths of the bronx have come back with it would that happen today without a determined rule breaking ed logue probably not many lump him with robert moses and there were strong similarities but unlike mr moses mr logue was a proud liberal who brought his social conscience to his projects trying unsuccessfully to build integrated housing in westchester and staying for days in his housing projects in coney island harlem and elsewhere asking his staff members to do the same they were called live ins said mr lefkowitz it was supposed to give people who were doing the planning a better appreciation of how a project functioned what people wanted what it felt like to live there critics chief among them jane jacobs an urban expert considered mr logue to be a ruthless figure who imposed his will on communities in the moses fashion headstrong and willful he certainly was but thousands of new yorkers can afford decent places to live because of his public housing projects roosevelt island once an abandoned island in the east river is now a thriving community because of the logue stubbornness he unstuck a plan stalled for 20 years and built a diverse successful community where only weeds and old hospitals stood he 'd seen the bedraggled island from the window of his apartment on east end avenue and that was that he used to say that he loved nothing more than a cleared lot so that he could build big god knows mr koch said with a laugh heaven is going to be a different place 10 years from now

 it 's almost official the economy is in recession ending the longest uninterrupted expansion in american history the official dating of the recession the 10th since world war ii is expected to come as early as monday from the national bureau of economic research in cambridge mass long considered the arbiter of economic contractions and expansions the six members of the recession dating committee discussed the issue in a conference call yesterday the economists on the committee agreed not to talk about the decision but an announcement is scheduled for monday and a few now say that they think the economy is in a recession they had indicated earlier that the most likely starting date for the recession is march my personal opinion is that a recession has begun jeffrey frankel an economist at the kennedy school of government at harvard said after the conference call but he declined to say when he thought the recession had started or what the committee had decided but even before yesterday 's discussion some new economic data including a surge in october retail sales and a decline in initial jobless claims had led a number of forecasters to predict recently that the recession would be relatively mild and less severe than they thought earlier this shift in attitude has helped push interest rates higher as many investors are now behaving as if the federal reserve will soon stop cutting short term interest rates so aggressively at the same time stocks have rallied in anticipation of a recovery the dow jones industrial average is up nearly 21 percent since its post attack low on sept 21 while the nasdaq composite index has jumped 337 percent since its low still many economists are convinced that the economy may remain bogged down for a while and that any recovery might also be relatively modest there is some weakness left to come said richard berner chief united states economist at morgan stanley dean witter he expects a 35 percent decline in the economy in this quarter much sharper than the consensus view americans have not experienced a single full quarter of contraction in the total economy since early in 1993 and then the dip was just 01 percent the last recession as the research bureau defines it ended in march 1991 after starting in july 1990 the official announcement of the latest recession will come as no surprise before the terrorist attack on sept 11 many economists already thought the economy was in a recession or on the verge of one the attack and its aftermath made that opinion nearly unanimous the committee is expected to date the beginning of the recession as far back as march of this year when the growth in employment one of the research bureau 's four main economic indicators peaked if that is the date then the record expansion lasted almost exactly 10 years if this recession ends in the second quarter of next year which many economists are forecasting then it will last about a year average for recessions since the end of world war ii the dating of recessions is always done cautiously the research bureau 's business cycle dating committee as it is known usually waits until it has at least six months of data beyond what the committee determines to be the onset of a recession the dating of the start of the last recession was announced on april 25 1991 more than a month after the recession was already over as a simple rule of thumb many people define a recession as two quarters of consecutive decline in the gross domestic product while not official that rule has proved to be a pretty good barometer based on the latest gdp data the economy fell in the july to september quarter at an annual rate of 04 percent in the spring quarter economic output grew at an annual rate of 03 percent while in the first quarter which ran from january to march the economy grew at a 13 percent rate on average economists polled by bloomberg news expect the economy to contract at a rate of 08 percent in the current quarter the dating committee does not look at gdp data because those data are quarterly subject to major revisions and because it dates recessions by the month the four main indicators the panel considers are employment personal income minus government transfer payments like welfare industrial production and manufacturing and trade sales before yesterday 's meeting the committee had indicated in its most recent analysis of current conditions that only personal income was still rising its other main indicators for determining a recession had already experienced declines similar to those in past recessions the data continue to show substantial declines in real activity in manufacturing the sector reflected in the industrial production index and in real manufacturing and trade sales the committee said in a report on nov 9 aggregate employment has fallen substantially as well by about two thirds of the amount typical of earlier recessions among the four indicators only income has behaved differently from recession averages over the past seven months but in the end mr frankel noted it all comes down to the collective judgment of the committee there is no firm rule he said

 dick vermeil knows the enduring image he left behind when he last coached in the super bowl nearly two decades ago half wet blanket half drill sergeant vermeil wound his philadelphia eagles so tight in the week before super bowl xv in 1981 that they played panicky and tense in a game set in new orleans the loose and rambunctious oakland raiders who unlike vermeil 's eagles relished the carnival atmosphere and flouted the notion of curfew romped in a laugher that is at least the favored historical story line of the raiders 27 10 victory this evening arriving in atlanta for super bowl xxxiv as coach of the st louis rams vermeil neither disputed nor conceded past mistakes in the curious setting of pro football 's season ending game where entertainment meets military style preparations but in his first news conference he announced i do n't have any curfews scheduled just in case anyone has a vision of vermeil at midnight dashing around atlanta with a lamp shade on his head consider this vermeil 's coaching staff did not even accompany the team to atlanta for the beginning of the super bowl festivities the coaches are back in st louis preparing the rams game plan for sunday 's game with the tennessee titans that 's because vermeil 19 years removed from the week that has come to define the discipline driven excesses of his previous coaching tenure is still trying to figure out ways to make the super bowl more like a regular season game because his staff usually maps out the game plan on monday and tuesday each week in the rams suburban st louis offices the coaches are doing it again this week vermeil 's coaches will arrive here late tuesday night hours before they deliver the game plan on wednesday morning i felt like this was the best way to keep our normal routine vermeil said football coaches are famous creatures of habit and we feel very insecure outside of our usual routines so vermeil is willing to do some things differently the second time around though he 's only going so far i am much more relaxed this time and more mature a smiling and easygoing vermeil said moments after his team arrived at its atlanta hotel i remember being wound up in a lot of knots at this point in my last super bowl hopefully this is a little better approach vermeil would n't go so far as to admit that his nervousness made his 1980 81 eagles nervous and he even seemed to discount it at one point to think the raiders won that game because we were extremely disciplined and wanted to send a great image about what we were all about to america vermeil said i do n't think that 's right but vermeil also did not run from the characterization that he might have created an atmosphere that was too rigid i do n't know if my players could sense that i was wound up vermeil said whenever you lose a game like that whatever you did was wrong for the rest of your life it 's what you did wrong i 've learned to live with that that week i just told them that anybody who was going out and getting in trouble i was going to send them home it 's a business trip this is a business trip i do n't expect there to be any problems super bowl teams have had diverse philosophies about curfews including when in the week to begin them meanwhile the few rams who were available to reporters after their trip tonight to atlanta did not believe they needed reminders from vermeil about their nighttime conduct i do n't expect guys to lock themselves in their rooms linebacker london fletcher said guys will go out but they 'll be careful said running back marshall faulk i do n't see something like that as being any kind of issue in this game told that it was a primary topic 19 years ago faulk replied nineteen years is a long time ago extra points rams coach dick vermeil said he did not expect any players to miss sunday 's game because of injury that included place kicker jeff wilkins who has a sore knee and who missed a 44 yard field goal in the national football conference championship game the rams had considered signing kicker nick lowery last week but vermeil believed wilkins could kick through his injury and still thinks so his injury is no excuse for missing a field goal vermeil said if i thought so i 'd take a guy off the streets he said that right defensive end fred miller also had a sore knee but he did not expect it to affect miller 's play significantly vermeil 63 also declined to discuss whether he was considering retirement from coaching especially if his rams win
 aaron williams shook his head and scrunched his nose he 's not in favor of his new nickname the beast i do n't know where they got that he said softly shrugging his monstrous shoulders a motion akin to silent thunder nah a train that 's my nickname the a train decidedly a local has made seven stops in the national basketball association in seven years most recently arriving here with the nets at 29 with a wife and 1 year old daughter williams hopes his 6 year 17 million contract will ensure that new jersey is his last stop he has been a reserve power forward everywhere his personality matching his position and will return to play one of his former teams the washington wizards wednesday night still comfortable in his role the coaches of his most recent teams washington and seattle have been impressed by his defensive talent but frustrated by his inconsistency three games into this season though nets coach byron scott does not share that view this kid is good he 's a lot better than people thought he was scott said he can be a presence down low in the box we thought if we can push him to think he can be a good offensive player and that got in his head then we 've got something scott then added with a smile and i think we do stephon marbury called williams the beast after a roaring awe inspiring dunk in practice one which williams replicated today in practice over the 7 foot center soumailia samake scott invoked the nickname after williams scored 20 points and pulled down 9 rebounds on opening night but williams considers such a fierce nickname ill fitting even if he is 6 feet 9 inches tall weighs 245 pounds and has arm muscles that ripple in statuesque abundance he bench presses 405 pounds he has 45 percent body fat williams 's nomadic career is curious for someone whose athletic talents are plain to see especially since his former coaches consider him likable respectful and coachable aaron has a load of talent said darrell walker who was the wizards interim coach last season and is now their director of player personnel but some nights he just floats on you then all of a sudden he 'll have a game that will make you go 'my god it was on that latter premise and his proven defensive abilities that the nets signed williams last summer to their 25 million exception more than he had ever made in the nba he went undrafted out of xavier university in 1993 bounced around overseas and in the continental basketball association for three years while picking up a series of 10 day nba contracts in 1997 he played in 32 games for vancouver before settling in for two seasons with seattle playing behind vin baker last season in 81 games with washington williams scored a career high 76 points a game averaged 19 minutes and led the team with 92 blocks washington wanted to re sign him and offered him a deal competitive with the nets but williams chose new jersey for its new direction and the minutes he could earn i 've never really had steady consistent playing time williams said it 's hard to be consistent when you do n't know if you 're going to play 5 minutes 30 minutes last year playing in washington i had more consistent minutes and that helped me get here walker pushed williams to reach his potential trying to make him consistently aggressive i called him into my office one day and said 'aaron it 's a shame that with your talent level compared to bo outlaw 's talent level he makes more money than you walker said not to take anything away from bo but aaron you should be mad at yourself but williams rarely gets mad he and his family have been living in a hotel for six weeks unable to find the right house the claustrophobia in a hotel room coupled with the area 's high real estate prices are about the only two things that truly make williams angry he says otherwise he is as laid back as a late summer day content in his quietude and in his role his introvertedness frustrates coaches said milwaukee bucks coach george karl who coached williams in seattle potentially you see the flamboyance you see his quick jumping ability but what 's frustrating is the mental toughness and consistency but karl thinks he has seen a change in williams he 's now moved into that 20 to 30 minute type of player karl said he is moving up a level scott hopes williams is ready to make that leap still after williams 's initial explosion in the season opener he got into foul trouble in the following game and scored only 4 points and had 7 rebounds he scored 6 of his 8 points from the line in the nets last game a loss to charlotte though his impact is often not reflected in statistics we have one guy right now who 's a presence and that 's aaron williams scott said he 's the only one who catches it deep and takes it to the basket we 've got to get more guys like that with the rookie forward kenyon martin struggling offensively shooting 11 for 36 with just one trip to the foul line scott is relying on williams designing more plays for him though williams has outplayed martin scott said he still wants to bring williams off the bench because he is accustomed to that role that 's fine with williams he is content with his long term security and the nets are encouraged with his improvement everybody has labeled him as a defensive player and a rebounder scott said we 're saying he can score too and we 're going to show you guys he can
 michael jordan and the washington wizards minority owner ted leonsis are expected to dine tonight in the washington area a supposedly gentlemanly affair with only one detail at stake perhaps the future of jordan with the team a franchise he and his legions feel he rescued from the nba 's scrap heap though jordan and leonsis get along famously the team 's ownership is generally displeased about the direction jordan has taken the wizards the past three seasons according to two team officials who spoke on condition of anonymity it has raised speculation that the wizards and jordan may part ways as early as tomorrow the dinner is a precursor for a scheduled meeting tomorrow among jordan leonsis and the team 's majority owner abe pollin the meeting is also expected to include curtis polk jordan 's representative and david osnos pollin 's longtime lawyer pollin through a representative and leonsis via an e mail message declined to comment yesterday in a telephone interview polk said jordan still hoped to remain with the team in his previous position as director of basketball operations even after reports of teammate resentment toward jordan who retired this season as a player for the third time and ownership 's concerns about his day to day commitment to an executive position throughout the season it 's always been michael 's hope and intention to sit down with mr pollin and ted leonsis polk said assuming they thought he did a good job as a manager before he would get his position back michael has no list of demands for this meeting all along he has made it really clear that he was to go back to the same job he had before with the same responsibilities we intend to hopefully go in there have a short and sweet meeting and he 'll be the president again jordan 's representatives are privately worried that ownership is interested in a reduced role for jordan but a team official who spoke on condition of anonymity said jordan would not report to anyone else in the organization if he were to return to the club wes unseld the team 's general manager announced last week that he would take a leave of absence after the draft in june the official said that jordan and his advisers had originally planned to ask for more control heading into tomorrow 's meeting control that would include overseeing marketing and other facets of the team 's operations any claims to the contrary have raised concerns about jordan 's intentions after a new deal is struck there is a mistrust on both sides at this point the official said will michael return it 's definitely possible but the road everyone is going down right now is n't conducive to that outcome jordan 's representatives denied any intention to negotiate a role that would give him more executive authority than he had previously the representatives are shocked that ownership has apparently questioned where the team has gone under jordan 's leadership the wizards who sold out every game at the mci center during jordan 's last two seasons on the court finished 37 45 for the second straight season for the sixth straight season and the fourth with jordan involved the wizards failed to advance to the playoffs still pollin and leonsis have publicly been supportive of jordan 's moves to upgrade the franchise including adding player friendly amenities that include building a family lounge for players wives and children and hiring strength coaches moves that have made the franchise a viable option for prospective free agents jordan also rid the team of juwan howard 's exorbitant contract and jettisoned fading veterans like mitch richmond and rod strickland for young talent jordan 's representatives said that no meetings had been scheduled with other nba teams that might offer jordan an ownership role but a person close to jordan who refused to speak for attribution acknowledged calling the league office to ask about a rule against speaking to other teams while jordan was playing any person in a similar situation as michael would take the same action the person with knowledge of jordan 's intentions said but as of right now no meetings have been scheduled michael was just keeping his options open if things did not work out that call upset team officials who felt jordan was already planning an exit strategy charlotte atlanta and possibly milwaukee and miami are said to be among the teams jordan would consider partnerships with in the event he does not return to the wizards how much authority jordan wanted and how much ownership wanted to give has always permeated the relationship between the sides pollin the league 's senior owner at 79 has vowed never to give up majority interest in the franchise hurting jordan 's chances of making all the changes he wanted one of the team officials spoke of an uneasy alliance from the beginning the day jordan was to announce he had forged a partnership with wizards ownership in january 2000 a 4 pm news conference was delayed for 45 minutes allegedly because of last minute demands by jordan and polk at 10 to 4 curtis and michael get on the phone from a car and basically ask abe and ted for a new charter plane through the nba 's service and an agreement that michael would attend no more than six home games per season the official said that 's how everything began

 thirty years ago when her son kenny was born joanne consentino began making fruitless trips down the aisles of toy stores discovering shortly after his birth that her baby was mentally and physically retarded and could n't hold his head up or smile she soon realized he would never be able to play with traditional toys like legos and building blocks or the trendy holiday items that most mothers pull off the shelves during this season of year unfortunately there was very little available at the time for a child like mine mrs consentino said explaining why she and her husband paul eventually began manufacturing toys for handicapped children in what parents of other handicapped children now say is a long overdue awakening toy companies from small companies like mrs consentino 's bryn mar associates here to chains like toys 'r us the nation 's largest retailer for children 's toys are increasingly offering products for youngsters with physical and mental disabilities the industry has finally realized like cosmetics makers did when they began offering makeup for black women and auto manufacturers learned when they sought out female customers that it often pays to market to previously overlooked consumer groups a strong market for toys for handicapped children not only exists but has also been growing according to the american academy of pediatrics it estimates that at least six million children have some form of disability ranging from learning disorders to severe mental and physical handicaps the number has increased by about 20 percent in the last decade as survival rates have risen for premature babies and for infants with ailments that were once usually fatal stephen madey chief adminstrative officer of the united cerebal palsy association of westchester in purchase said people who work with handicapped children first began to see a small number of toys manufactured for that group about 25 years ago but he said that there are still too few items for them especially with computer games he added the software programs move along too rapidly for a child with motor problems now the current market for toys for handicapped children is as much as 2 billion a year according to the toy manufacturers of america a trade organization based in new york city and it is likely to grow faster than the 207 billion toy market as a whole manufacturers are learning to tap that market mattel several years ago introduced a barbie friend in a wheelchair share a smile becky similarly little tikes had a run on its patio doll houses after it introduced advertisements featuring a handicapped child to show that the child size houses had been modified to make them wheelchair accessible and in the five years since the toy makers group began producing a guide to toys for blind children distribution has grown to 80000 from 20000 mrs consentino has fit easily into this specialized market soldering circuit boards and capability switches and using a drill press glue gun and other equipment in the attic of her home to manufacture toys activity centers communication boards and other equipment now these kids are finally able to make something move and they love it she said in an interview at her workshop here the company was founded in 1991 when mr consentino an electrical engineer developed the original designs and trained his wife to work with him disabled himself from radiation treatments for cancer mr consentino decided to work from his home today the early designs and others that have followed allow disabled children to hit a target with their heads instead of their hands and make it respond with blinking lights sound and responses they never could obtain before bryn mar 's toys are also used in many classrooms where students without fine motor control can identify objects by swatting at a large switch the company 's clients include among others sportime international a sporting goods wholesaler and retailer in atlanta dragon fly toys for special children in manitoba canada several school systems and children 's hospitals the company also sells privately to social workers counselors speech pathologists and parents of disabled children the company can be found on the web at wwwbrynmarcom also in westchester dr steven e kanor a rehabilitation engineer in hastings on hudson also makes toys for disabled children

 to the editor i consider it tragic the simplistic and superficial fashion in which mental health problems are generally being handled in this country some still prefer the couch yes psychoanalysis being an extremely difficult profession has made many mistakes and is still evolving and it is not for everyone but the comments of those interviewed in the article are quite common among those of us who have made the commitment to psychoanalysis this form of therapy has suffered too long under a way of thinking propagated by hollywood and those in the profession who have little knowledge of it further psychoanalysis is not just a treatment style but a way of conceptualizing human problems that can be useful in different contexts it is knowledge that needs to be shared john lundin san francisco
 to the editor re the days of coasting are gone dec 8 which described how the nation 's big airlines may need to find a whole new way of doing business in order to survive consider a recent scene from the new world of travel having braved a long line in security at the fort lauderdale airport a few weeks ago a passenger finally arrived at the barrier only to be sent back to check a bag that did not fit the new stricter rules for carry on luggage the question for the airlines is this will that passenger fly again unless he absolutely has to in a climate of indiscriminate cost cutting produced by the recession and 9 11 airlines seem not to distinguish between two very different types of cost savings the efficiency related for example decreasing the amount of time a jetliner spends on the ground and the service related which effectively lower the quality of the product they sell and are equivalent to price increases since sept 11 the airlines have been saddled with a quality of service reduction namely a tightening in airport security that increases the time and the hassle factor associated with flights amazingly instead of improving service on board to compensate for that they have taken measures to further decrease the quality of their product in addition to the cramped seating there is now no food served on most flights carry on regulations have been tightened and rules on nonrefundable tickets are more strictly enforced i believe airlines also underestimate the elasticity of demand in this case the availability of substitutes for cramped stressful flights at the upper end of the market business travelers are turning to corporate jets and videoconferencing at the lower end there are even more substitutes in a study i published with a colleague at cornell in the mid 80 's we found that when gasoline prices increased people did not cancel vacations but rather substituted holidays close to home for faraway vacations the same seems to be happening now as people substitute road travel for flying s abraham ravid newark dec 10 the writer is a professor of finance and economics at rutgers business school
 islanders coach peter laviolette remembers what it was like to watch a videotape of a game and be able to skip past his team 's smaller errors his goaltender chris osgood was touch up paint for the dents and scratches but that was one long year ago now the islanders are staggering and osgood can not regain his spot as the team 's top goaltender his goals against average is the worst in the national hockey league and he finds himself thinking instead of reacting you get what you deserve and by no means do i deserve to get ice time the way i 've been playing osgood said today after practice osgood began the day ranked last among 46 nhl goaltenders with a 465 goals against average that is three goals a game more than he was averaging a year ago his save percentage has dropped to 793 from 943 osgood was as magnificent last season as he has been porous this season but when asked if he had had a more harrowing stretch in his career he said not even close to this the islanders 3 8 1 0 will try to end their five game losing streak thursday at montreal and the only promise laviolette could make today about his lineup was that right wing arron asham a grinder who used to be with the canadiens would be playing i 'm there to create momentum said asham a healthy scratch in the islanders last two games momentum was what osgood provided last season one year ago today following a 3 0 victory over tampa bay he was 10 2 1 with three shutouts he was the league 's player of the month in october osgood who turns 30 on nov 26 helped detroit win the stanley cup in 1998 but he seemed to get as much delight out of simply enabling the islanders to make the playoffs the red wings could cover up his mistakes i feel like when i 'm playing well here the team plays better he said now laviolette does not know or would not say which goaltender will start thursday but he has found himself answering questions about rick dipietro the former no 1 draft choice who plays for the islanders bridgeport conn farm team dipietro is apparently still not an option but osgood is not the islanders no 1 goaltending option either garth snow has been and osgood 's slide has been as unexpected to him as it has been to everyone else around this struggling team you 'd like to think the previous nine years is no fluke laviolette said as recently as three weeks ago laviolette said he was certain that osgood would begin to play better laviolette said today that he would love to have osgood play his way out of his slump but the islanders can not afford many more bad nights in goal from anyone osgood has played only twice in the last two weeks and he allowed two goals in the first 31 seconds of a 6 2 loss to philadelphia and six goals on 32 shots saturday in a loss to st louis he made changes but the changes did not work either i should have stuck to what 's made me successful osgood said today so that is what osgood has decided to do for now he said he was using the technique and the attitude that worked so well at the start of last season but he also said he was not relying on it thinking too much is apparently bad for a goaltender it 's mental he said i 'm just thinking too much it ends up being way too much clutter
 at midseason michigan seemed to be squandering its chance for a national championship or even for a big ten title the wolverines had lost two of their previous three games as they prepared to play minnesota everything about the game seemed odd they were playing at a strange time a friday night and in an unusual stadium the metrodome in minneapolis after three quarters they trailed the golden gophers by 28 7 our backs were to the wall steve breaston a wide receiver and punt returner said were we going to lay down and die instead of falling to the mediocrity of a 4 3 record the wolverines rallied for 31 points in the fourth quarter and won 38 35 it was the greatest single game comeback in team history after that they won their next five games and they will bring a 10 2 record into the rose bowl on thursday against southern california which is 11 1 although michigan won the big ten it has no chance at a national championship according to the bowl championship series formula which is heavily dependent on computer rankings that honor will be decided in the sugar bowl on sunday when oklahoma plays louisiana state the winner of the sugar bowl will be presented the trophy as the bcs champion immediately after the game but southern cal which is ranked no 1 in the associated press news media and usa today espn coaches polls can at least claim a share of the title if it finishes with a victory in the rose bowl over no 4 michigan it is unlikely that southern cal will lose its top ranking in the ap poll the trojans are playing in their home region and are favored what could possibly go wrong first time all year we 've been underdogs michigan tight end andy mignery said mignery and his teammates said little about their situation that could be construed as contentious or controversial wolverines stars like their leading rusher chris perry and their leading receiver braylon edwards did not even attend a news conference that was supposed to feature the michigan offense those who attended watched their words we 're kind of like a silent assassin quarterback john navarre said we do n't open our mouths tony pape one of navarre 's linemen was a little more loquacious the media 's overlooked us but i do n't think the sc team has he said if we won the game i 'd love to be no 1 mignery added this is the national championship game in regards to the human polls we 're not going to be able to touch the computer polls so should the wolverines claim a national championship with a victory that 's not up to me mignery said but i think we do have a case if the game works out if it works out for michigan it will be the climax of a turbulent season the team played better in the second half of the season in the weeks after clinching the victory in minnesota with a 33 yard field goal in the final minute by the freshman garrett rivas the wolverines beat their two major rivals michigan state by 27 20 on the road and ohio state by 35 21 at home unlike michigan teams of previous eras these wolverines have a balanced offense perry was a heisman trophy finalist after leading the conference with a 50 yards per carry average for 1589 yards in 12 games but the passing attack was also impressive edwards caught 14 touchdown passes and finished second in the conference with 625 receptions a game for 1031 yards in 12 games over all the pass attack averaged 2708 yards second in the league to michigan state 's 2795 although edwards led the team with 75 receptions perry was third with 42 many of them on screen plays it was this approach that sparked the comeback against minnesota the trojans are aware of how this short strike followed sometimes by a long run takes advantage of eager pass rushers kenechi udeze a southern cal defensive end said when they dump a screen off the center and the two guards leave early so you 're kind of dumbfounded it 's kind of a surprise because by that time they already have a couple steps on you they work their scheme very well they know what they are doing that may apply to this game over all the wolverines know they can play on the road in a loose frame of mind and spoil southern cal 's season in the trojans own territory melvin simmons a southern cal linebacker seemed to sense it when he said we have more to lose than they do

movie kissin cousins in her 1989 book first father first daughter little brown company ms reagan recalled i went out on so many auditions i began to think of changing my middle name to rejection her brief television and movie career was followed by a stint as a talk show host on kabc radio in los angeles and in 1969 she joined a uso tour of vietnam by 1980 ms reagan was director of an organization called sell overseas america which promoted american products abroad a position she resigned two years later to pursue her senate campaign ms reagan 's book revealed that she had been the

1983 she was given the title of special consultant to the republican national committee and moved to the family quarters in the white house when asked if she had been happy with her father 's record on women 's issues she said no i have n't i think there could be a much better record and i would certainly place the blame i think where it belongs that 's in the hands of certain people on the senior staff who have never really accepted that there is a political power of women and that has to be addressed larry speakes a white house spokesman in the reagan administration noted in his book

to recall the part he had played in a movie actors always remember the roles they played she said she joined the alzheimer 's association board and began traveling the country to raise research money her personal and political creed was perhaps best summed up in a 1982 interview people who hurt my friends i have a lot of trouble forgiving she said people who hurt me i tend to forgive but i never

 dikembe mutombo watched with despair from the bench when the nets sank in houston and cheered when they resurfaced in new orleans it 's like we 're in the ocean and we got hit by a huge wave mutombo said we 're going to bounce back off the wave i want us to bounce back that way there 's not so much pressure when i come back mutombo has almost recovered from surgery to repair the torn ligament in his right wrist last december and hopes to return to his starting post at center before the end of the month after three debilitating losses in texas the nets won for the first time in eight games on the road sunday against the hornets 102 92 with 18 games remaining before the playoffs 15 against eastern conference teams the nets 39 25 are two games ahead of philadelphia for the atlantic division lead and a game behind detroit for the eastern conference lead they need to win 13 games to tie last season 's record but the nets are determined not to dwell on last season or even the frustrations of last week instead they are looking ahead that is where mutombo comes in i 'll definitely be back before houston mutombo said referring to the game against 7 foot 6 yao ming and the houston rockets at home on march 31 mutombo will participate in shooting drills this week and may practice next week i 'm very close he said the nets are not sure what to expect from the 36 year old mutombo while happy to have his 7 foot 2 defensive presence back they know they can not suddenly rely on him i think that 's real unfair to look at deke and say he 's our savior coach byron scott said we want to be playing real solid basketball when he gets back and get him into that puzzle not look at him once he gets back and everybody takes a big sigh of relief he 'll anchor the center position he 'll block shots and rebound and intimidate guys mutombo said he would do more than that even though he had not fully adjusted to the offense at the time of his injury when i come back i am going to have an impact mutombo said i 'm going to be much better than i was at the start of the season i 'm more fit and skill wise i have improved a few things i have improved my shooting with my left hand mutombo joined the nets in san antonio on the second game of the four game road trip shooting soft jumpers and free throws while continuing his therapy he tore the ligament on thanksgiving in los angeles and when he had his cast removed after six weeks he could only work on his conditioning on an exercise bicycle so he read lance armstrong 's autobiography it 's not about the bike and drew inspiration from armstrong 's recovery from cancer you ca n't let one thing stop you mutombo said illness and injuries happen it was a big shock the way things happened to me you want to stay positive every day at times that was difficult for him the nets were on a hot streak in december and january but they have struggled since the all star game break winning 5 of 15 games the nets are curious to see whether their victory against new orleans will begin a reversal of their shooting woes or whether it was merely a stopgap we 'll see kenyon martin said it 's just one game it feels great just to see guys playing well guys making shots we have to keep playing hard after the nets beat indiana on feb 20 they lost their next three games after beating the knicks they lost to utah at home at dallas at san antonio and at houston on sunday night jason kidd revealed that he had tendinitis in his left achilles an injury that affected his lateral movement and his spring that may explain his 12 for 46 shooting in the three games in texas a magnetic resonance imaging exam yesterday was negative despite the pain kidd had 17 points 10 assists and 9 rebounds in 43 minutes on sunday against new orleans jason is just different mutombo said you do n't compare him with anyone in this league the things he does on a daily basis are incredible he plays through fatigue and injury and makes sure the team gets better against the hornets kidd had help brian scalabrine a second year forward showed sparked off the bench with 16 points shooting 7 for 9 in 27 minutes scott used scalabrine more than rodney rogers who has struggled all season but everyone else on the nets seemed to have snapped out of their slumps in new orleans they played with urgency again recognizing they can not wait for anyone

 one of the greatest challenges for nasa managers when space shuttles start flying again will be finding better ways to anticipate problems that can compromise safety the leader of the space agency said today sean o'keefe the national aeronautics and space administration administrator said a theme emerging in the investigation of the columbia disaster was how well the agency identifies potential problems testimony by experts before the independent board investigating the feb 1 loss of the columbia and its seven member crew has repeatedly brought up nasa 's capacity to do trend analysis mr o'keefe said at a news briefing such analysis of abnormal events large and small can help identify things that could be safety problems in the future when we identify problems there is no question people get all over it to fix it mr o'keefe said but the agency 's record of spotting trends in operations that can point to potential problems that could be fixed early has been mixed he said mr o'keefe said the three remaining shuttles would fly again as soon as nasa adopted the recommendations of the columbia accident investigation board which are expected this summer the space agency is eager to resume launching shuttles as soon as possible so it can continue construction and maintenance of the international space station but in no case are we rushing to return to flight at the expense of safety mr o'keefe said when flights restart the first shuttle to go up will be commanded by col eileen m collins of the air force colonel collins had been assigned to lead a march shuttle mission to the space station that was to follow the columbia 's safe return but all shuttle flights were grounded after the accident the assignment to return the shuttle to flight status will be colonel collins 's fourth mission and her second as commander we could not have entrusted this to a more competent commander who is extremely well qualified to do it mr o'keefe said also assigned to the first resumed flight were other members of colonel collins 's crew from the earlier assignment lt col james m kelly of the air force dr stephen k robinson and soichi noguchi an astronaut with the japanese space agency the mission will probably be a resupply and crew exchange flight to the space station mr o'keefe said a hunt for columbia debris that has covered more than a half million acres in texas and louisiana is winding down and operations should end in about two weeks he said more than 70000 pieces of the columbia have been recovered representing almost 40 percent of the shuttle by weight he said

 when the devils begin defense of their stanley cup championship tonight in boston against the bruins do not expect this season 's squad to be radically different from the previous dozen or so devils teams there will be some new players in the lineup but they will be expected to get right in step with the stepford like approach that helps make the devils a perennial power in the national hockey league the way this team is run from top to bottom is that it 's all about the team said center erik rasmussen who signed with the devils as a free agent this summer you come in here to help the team win and you put the team in front of yourself no one separates themselves from the others irksome to their detractors but envied by many others the devils have built their success on a robotic commitment to the organization and to a defensive minded system that eschews the star factor and instead focuses on what the group of 20 players can accomplish with three stanley cups in nine years 12 consecutive winning seasons three stanley cup finals appearances in the last four seasons and five atlantic division crowns in the last seven years few can argue with the success of the devils organization there 's no question it is all about winning here said scott stevens who has been captain of the devils since 1992 that 's what we expect from ourselves and there is no question it starts from the top at the top of devils franchise is lou lamoriello their president and general manager who has set the disciplined tone within the organization for 17 seasons the devils style of play reflects lamoriello 's no nonsense style of management it is no surprise that the devils have been able to win the stanley cup with different coaches jacques lemaire in 1995 larry robinson in 2000 and pat burns last season with lamoriello in charge burns will try to guide the devils to back to back titles a feat last accomplished by the detroit red wings in 1997 and 1998 a lot of people do n't believe it can happen but we do burns said once again the linchpin to the devils success will be the play of martin brodeur who won his first vezina trophy as the nhl 's top goaltender last season with brodeur playing in 73 games last season the devils shared the jennings trophy with the philadelphia flyers for allowing the fewest goals in the league 166 my reputation has been made for a while brodeur said winning the vezina does n't change anything guys always try and beat me because of who i am and what i 've accomplished the devils will enter this season with only a handful of new players rasmussen is joined up front by the newcomers igor larionov a 42 year old center and mike rupp who split time last season with the devils and their minor league affiliate in albany before scoring the cup winning goal against the anaheim mighty ducks last spring on defense the 22 year old rookies paul martin and david hale made the team after playing well in the preseason the devils also signed sean brown as a free agent during the summer we 're the team to beat and we 've been through this before brodeur said our system means we 'll be in every game we play this season
 progress can be counted in many ways in the sport of track and field seconds and inches are not the only measuring sticks marcia bailey the coach of the boys track and field team at henrick hudson high school in montrose looked around her school 's sports complex during the county track championships recently and saw other women also coaching male athletes it was n't that way when she took over the hen hud boys team in 1979 i do n't think i ever ran into another woman coach back then she recalled but i did n't really run into any resistance either after all i was teaching in the building and many of the boys i was coaching i also had in my math classes ms bailey who had started with the girls team a few years earlier and then took over both squads had never competed in the sport in high school herself she had never had the chance when i went to westlake high school in thornwood she said it was before the era of girls sports but we did have a good intramural program i did n't get to run on the varsity level until college by the time i graduated in 1974 girls sports were just starting in high schools soon after she began coaching both hen hud squads were track and field powers in league district and even county circles despite competing against larger schools this season the sailors finished second in the league ii b championships in both the boys and girls competitions after winning both titles the year before in our school and our community ms bailey said sports are a very important part of the educational process ms bailey is part of that process she 's really caring said andy rawlins a sophomore sprinter and pole vaulter she 's like that on the track and in the class rawlins had a math class with his coach as a freshman and is in one of her computer classes this term ms bailey has won the respect of colleagues she 's had a few arguments in her time dick mann a high school track and field official at major county meets said but it 's not because she 's a woman she 's always looking out for her kids and she 's very certain of how she wants things done she 's very well organized a very good coach ms bailey said she tailors her coaching to the individual athlete you do n't teach boys differently than girls she said but some kids need a pat on the back and some need a push as with math you have to do problems over and over so that you can master them and the coach will do them right along with her pupils i try to understand the difficulties my athletes have ms bailey said i was a runner and a jumper when i competed and my running was in the shorter distancesi became a distance runner so i could relate more to distance runners i tried the pole vault so i could relate to my pole vaulters currently hen hud has an outstanding hammer thrower in dave americo whose toss of 158 feet 2 inches was 30 feet better than that of the runner up in the county meet so the 5 foot 7 130 pound bailey has been learning more about the event by tossing around the 12 pound hammer the sailors boys team however finished a disappointing sixth overall in the county competition partly because their best all around athlete kevin alford who figured to score in if not win the jumping and hurdling events had been sick all week coach bailey would not let him compete on a raw rainy day alford and americo are two of five hen hud male track stars who are going to continue their sports in college next year and they have been more than competitors in high school my upperclassmen are my assistant coaches said ms bailey who often has not had the luxury of an assistant coach i have a lot of them teaching the underclassmen it has been that way since she was a pioneer 21 years ago society has changed andy rawlins said you get used to having women doing jobs men used to do we 're all on the same planet

 with only nine days to go until the belmont stakes and with two races in the triple crown series complete it is no longer so much about proving who has the best horse but who can deliver a healthy and fit animal to the starting gate for the race on june 7 for that reason it was a good morning for the barclay tagg stable and funny cide yesterday and a dismal one for a horse thought to be one of his main competitors in his first workout since his dominant victory in the preakness funny cide acted like a horse who is holding up just fine continuing a pattern of fast and seemingly effortless workouts that has been part of his itinerary since before the kentucky derby funny cide a new york bred gelding breezed through a quick five furlong workout in 5943 seconds over a muddy main track at belmont park he 's got a big job ahead of him and i think we 're keeping him at his peak at his level tagg said he 's doing great i have no complaints with the way he 's doing about 750 miles to the southwest the trainer ron ellis may have been wishing he had reason to be as optimistic atswhatimtalknbout a fast charging fourth in the kentucky derby slogged through a one mile workout at churchill downs that was so slow that ellis is questioning the wisdom of running in the belmont atswhatimtalknbout a son of ap indy slogged his way through a one mile workout over a fast track in 1 4680 funny cide is known as a good workout horse so the quick time yesterday came as no surprise but it was nonetheless good news for a stable that believes the main obstacle to sweeping the triple crown may be keeping the horse at a high level something that is not always easy to do after two such grueling races as the kentucky derby and the preakness if he 's the same as he was going into the kentucky derby and the preakness nothing can beat him said robin smullen funny cide 's exercise rider and assistant trainer but everything has to continue to fall into place the fatigue factor is the thing you have to worry about it 's been a tough road he 's been on he appears to be the same horse but sometimes you wo n't know until the race itself everything can seem to be 100 percent and then they wo n't quite have what they had in other races but he appears to be just as good now as he was before the other two races tagg had postponed the workout because of the bad weather which had left the belmont main track a mess but he was satisfied with yesterday 's conditions to return to serious training the result was a workout that was the fastest among the 12 horses who worked at the distance it has not been a good couple of weeks for ellis who has been trying to work through foot problems with atswhatimtalknbout who has a quarter crack in his right front hoof atswhatimtalknbout had missed two days of training last week but appeared to be back on track yesterday 's workout could mean that the foot troubles are not behind him he went really slow ellis said i think he 's protecting that quarter crack he was traveling fine but he was n't enthusiastic we patched it up two days ago we 're going to take the patch off thursday and see how his foot looks we 'll make a decision on the belmont stakes after that you just do n't know how it 's going to look until you pull the patch off in addition to the slow time atswhatimtalknbout lost the shoe on his left front foot during the workout the possible field for the belmont has 13 horses those considered definite starters are funny cide empire maker dynever ten most wanted scrimshaw best minister colita and supervisor the possible starters are atswhatimtalknbout midway road go rockin robin outta here and wild and wicked
 another labor day has passed with the usual cookouts marches and store sales but characteristically little notice of what may be the fastest growing part of the work force those who labor off the books by its nature of course the underground economy is hard to measure but it 's not hard to see lately it has been all around us which is especially noteworthy now that the unemployment rate seems stuck at more than 6 percent some people have suggested that the unemployment figure is deceptively low there are after all more than two million people in prison many more than in decades past and disability claims are up too if all these potential workers were counted the unemployment rate would indeed be higher but the number of such potential workers is far exceeded by the total of those working off the books whose labors would drive down the unemployment rate significantly if counted that is especially true by historical standards because the amount of underground economic activity has been expanding so much the international monetary fund in a global survey of underground economic activity last year found that this sector has been growing in the united states for 30 years the authors of the imf report have estimated underground economic activity at 86 percent of gross domestic product in the united states up from 67 percent in 1990 and just 4 percent in 1970 because most people who work off the books are in labor intensive fields investment bankers and heart surgeons tend to operate within the confines of the tax system it is a safe bet that 9 percent of gdp translates to more than 9 percent of the work force no one is sure how many people work off the books but most of us do n't need the imf to tell us that the total is significant if you have children for instance you may be paying somebody off the books to care for them perhaps full time edgar l feige a retired economist at the university of wisconsin who is an authority on the underground economy has estimated from currency data that unreported income in the united states more than doubled during the 1990 's reaching 125 trillion in 2000 one reason for this growth is the arrival of millions of immigrants especially illegal ones there were an estimated 87 million illegal immigrants in this country in 2000 according to the census bureau and a large proportion are working off the books for employers who appreciate cheap compliant labor free of employment regulations and payroll taxes another reason is the growing importance of the service economy it is easier to keep this activity off the books in the case of child care for instance parents do not want to wrestle with paperwork and payroll taxes while the child care providers often prefer to avoid taxes in effect parents get cheaper labor while workers get higher wages changes in society over the decades have also encouraged off the books work women 's participation in the labor force exceeded 60 percent in 2001 up from 34 percent in 1950 that change has created much more demand for child care gardening and other domestic help while a large underground economy suggests a lot of tax evasion it also implies something positive that inflation is even lower than the official rate and of course it means that an awful lot of employment is not captured by government statistics so i 'm doubtful that unemployment was a big problem this labor day especially given the odds that someone out of work might be living with someone else who still has a job and thus can put food on the table that the united states economy has produced enough jobs for millions of women and immigrants over the years without unemployment soaring far beyond 6 percent is close to miraculous the real problem is what has happened to the least skilled and least paid workers from 1979 to 2001 according to the bureau of labor statistics the real earnings of men without high school diplomas fell by a horrifying 28 percent for women whose pay was already lower the decline was still 9 percent here too immigration and off the books labor have played roles by sharply increasing the pool of low skill labor a lot has changed since labor days past but we still have n't managed to repeal the law of supply and demand on the contrary daniel akst 's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first sunday of each month e mail culmoney nytimescom

 dr irving l lichtenstein who transformed hernia surgery from an operation requiring hospitalization and long recuperation into an uncomplicated outpatient procedure died june 11 at his home in marina del rey calif he was 80 the cause was parkinson 's disease his family said dr lichtenstein announced his new procedure in 1964 to the dismay of many in the medical establishment for a century before that surgeons had regarded the repair of hernias which occur when tissues protrude through a weakened area of muscle wall as a straightforward not especially interesting procedure with a basic technique hardly worth revisiting a patient was admitted to the hospital and on the day of surgery given general anesthesia a surgeon made an incision into the appropriate area of the abdomen and sewed the tear back together with sutures designed not to dissolve the patient stayed in the hospital as long as a week and was then sent home forbidden to work for about two months the thinking was that if the patient exerted himself too soon the tear would recur dr lichtenstein however said that both the prolonged bed rest and the general anesthesia were unnecessary and that the anesthesia was even counterproductive to prove this point he insisted that many of his patients walk away from the table after surgery my dad loved drama his daughter leslie lichtenstein of los angeles said that was dramatic dr lichtenstein who was long active in the american civil liberties union of southern california also loved a good battle and he got one when he stood in front of a thousand doctors attending an american medical association meeting in san francisco in 1964 and told them they were handling hernia patients all wrong a 1986 article in a magazine published by dr lichtenstein 's alma mater mcp hahnemann university school of medicine in pennsylvania recounted how he had been peppered by angry questions at the meeting when dr lichtenstein 's time was up the program director eager to get things rolling again suggested that those who still had questions take them into the hallway hundreds did so i was shocked dr lichtenstein remembered so many people followed physicians were shouting questions at me criticizing me challenging me there was a great deal of confusion and disorganization in truth dr lichtenstein had done little at least initially to change the basic way hernias were treated with some minor modifications like using a stronger suture material he was performing a 100 year old technique developed by edoardo bassini an italian surgeon it was on the question of how long patients needed to recover that he broke new ground he exploded the myth of not letting the patient do any physical activity for two months said dr parviz k amid director of the lichtenstein hernia institute which was founded in 1984 dr lichtenstein focused on hernia operations only after becoming interested in the broader issue of how wounds heal in the late 1950 's while he was teaching at ucla medical school and working at what is now known as cedars sinai medical center he watched as a gallbladder patient he had just sewn up began to retch violently remarkably the incision did not reopen and dr lichtenstein began to wonder about the reliability of the information he and untold others had been given about wound healing over the next several years dr lichtenstein established that in animals a properly sutured tear immediately regained 70 percent of its strength and that what mattered most was how it was sewn up and what material was used to test his ideas on humans he settled on hernia patients since their injuries were generally confined to the tear itself he used local instead of general anesthesia so that the patients would be able to follow his instructions on the table he would have them cough for example to test the strength of the repair although dr lichtenstein reported high success rates it took years for his practices to be widely adopted it was only about two decades later in part because of pressure from managed care to control costs that they became truly widespread outpatient treatment for hernias is now normal practice almost a million of the procedures are performed each year mostly on men in the meantime dr lichtenstein worked to refine the surgery devising simpler suture techniques and using mesh screens to reduce the risk of the hernia 's recurring dr lichtenstein 's practice was in beverly hills he stopped operating about 18 years ago as a result of parkinson 's disease irving lester lichtenstein was born on feb 21 1920 in philadelphia he graduated from the university of pennsylvania before attending hahnemann in addition to his daughter leslie he is survived by his wife lisa and three daughters nancy of los angeles patricia bisch of santa barbara calif and joanne lichtenstein of mill valley calif his marriage to the former billie ruth herskowitz the mother of his children ended in divorce correction july 6 2000 thursday an obituary on june 25 about dr irving l lichtenstein who made hernia surgery an outpatient procedure misstated the surname of his former wife she is billie ruth berkowitz not herskowitz a picture caption with the obituary misidentified the man shown with dr lichtenstein he was dr alex shulman a former colleague not dr parviz k amid

 what 's your favorite baseball team dad you know i grew up in new york city rooting for the yankees what 's your second favorite team second favorite i 'd have to say it was this team they 're playing today the oakland a 's oakland why oakland well first of all when i was a kid the a 's were in kansas city where they 'd moved from philadelphia they were n't very good but they were like cousins to the yankees whenever the yankees needed a good player to help them win the pennant they 'd call up kansas city and presto just like a pizza the player was delivered like who like roger maris who hit 61 home runs in 1961 breaking babe ruth 's record why 'd the a 's just give the yankees a guy who could hit 61 home runs it was about money the a 's were one of the poorer teams and the yankees just like now could afford to pay more good players did the a 's stop giving the yankees players when they went to oakland actually for a while they did the oakland a 's in the early 1970 's were in fact a great team the best of that decade they won three straight world series and five straight american league west titles they had an owner named charles o finley who was a little nutty but was always willing to try new things like orange baseballs they had an amazing cast of colorful players who wore cool mustaches they had pitchers named catfish hunter and vida blue blue moon odom and rollie fingers they also had reggie jackson one of the best all time sluggers and bigmouths plus in 1973 they did all of us yankee fans a huge favor by beating the mets in the world series what happened after that the yankees wound up taking catfish and eventually getting reggie then they won the world series so even in oakland the a 's were like the yankees cousins and they were lousy again for a few years people stopped going to their games one season a student run college radio station had to broadcast the games for a while but as the a 's general manager billy beane told me the other day 'the a 's selling off players goes all the way back to connie mack in philadelphia but they have always been one of the most innovative franchises in baseball by the early 1980 's their farm system had produced three really good outfielders rickey henderson dwayne murphy and tony armas they played the aggressive style billyball of their manager billy martin who had also been with the yankees the a 's made the playoffs but lost to the yankees and then do n't tell me the yankees took their best player you got it henderson eventually joined the yankees and the manager martin rejoined them but even well into the era when players were leaving for the rich teams as well as being traded to them the a 's managed to build another excellent team they had the bash brothers jose canseco and mark mcgwire that mark mcgwire the very one he was on the a 's team that won three straight al pennants and won the 1989 world series a subway series like ours last year the a 's won four straight games over san francisco which is a bigger richer more glamorous city across the bay the a 's beating the giants in the world series is like the nets beating the knicks in the nba finals you were a sports columnist by then did you ever cover the bash brothers as a matter of fact i covered the first two games of that bay area series in oakland then before game 3 in san francisco a huge earthquake struck people died i was quite lucky that evening i might have been on a double decker freeway that collapsed had a friend not called to pick me up just as i was about to leave my hotel in oakland to drive over to his house in berkeley then what happened the series was delayed for more than a week i stayed to write about the earthquake the a 's best pitcher dave stewart who was from oakland gave me a tour of the poor and heavily damaged neighborhood he 'd grown up in after that i always rooted for stewart and did n't mind seeing the a 's do well because they always seemed to be struggling for fans in a city that fell on hard times and with owners who were losing money the poor a 's even had to trade mcgwire to st louis just before he hit 70 home runs so they traded maris who broke ruth 's record and mcgwire who broke maris 's with all that and everything else the a 's with 14 world series appearances are the second most successful al franchise behind the yankees will they ever keep their players as beane the general manager said 'part of the job description in oakland is the unknown but here the glass is always half full the a 's have this guy jason giambi who 's a great power hitter and some excellent young pitchers they almost beat the yankees in the playoffs last season and could very well beat them this time in october then what giambi will be a free agent after the season what do you think
 the answers about what is wrong with the jets run defense are starting to sound repetitive so the outcome against the st louis rams should not have been a surprise it takes a superior defense to contain the rams offense and it has been obvious for most of their six games that the jets are not close to being superior the jets do not have a single player like michael strahan of the giants who can wreak havoc on his own the jets defense on the other hand is a roll of the dice during sunday 's 34 14 loss the jets gave up 234 yards rushing including two trick plays their defense is the lowest ranked in the nfl i actually felt like we were in the game coach herman edwards said it was 7 7 and with four minutes left in the second quarter we self destruct we come out in the second half and that 's the game they gain 166 yards we gain 8 we have three plays on offense we 've played that way all year that 's why we 're 3 3 if we continue to play like that we 'll continue to win some and lose some there is no reason to believe the inconsistency will stop shane burton who had started the past three games at defensive tackle is doubtful for sunday 's game against carolina with a calf injury the rookie james reed played nose tackle for steve martin after martin moved to tackle after burton got hurt reed had five tackles and a fumble recovery but edwards said he also lined up in the wrong place three or four times reed and tom barndt will get more time this week and so will end rick lyle who had two sacks it 's a smorgasbord edwards said an example of the mental breakdowns that are pockmarking the jets season the failure to stop the rams on an option play that covered 56 yards for a touchdown even though they had practiced for it john abraham was supposed to tackle az zahir hakim in the backfield he did not and hakim broke downfield linebacker james farrior was playing between hakim and the pitch man trung canidate i thought he was going to pitch the ball farrior said i tried to make a play on the pitch and he kept the ball and went downfield i thought we had it down it showed up in the game and we did n't make the play then hakim made the pitch and canidate was gone we 've just got to be more consistent said safety victor green who had only one tackle we show flashes of greatness then we take a couple of steps back we knew we could beat this team we gave them what they got the rams tried to run the same play on their next drive and this time the jets read it correctly reed threw hakim for a 3 yard loss another example on a direct snap play to canidate the jets were in a maximum blitz with six players rushing one lineman edwards will not say who did not play his gap correctly and canidate ran straight ahead for a 12 yard touchdown edwards is adamant that he will not switch to a 3 4 defense that would require changing the defense in midseason then you 'd have to struggle for six seven eight games going that way edwards said where does shaun elis play he 's learning to play end already in a four man front abraham has to learn to play linebacker again he 's not playing end real good right now so how is he going to play linebacker all of a sudden this is how we 're going to build this football team with a 4 3 defense it does n't look good right now it was the same 4 3 defense that played the dolphins and shut them out in the second half extra points wayne chrebet had a cat scan monday he had more headaches and dizziness during the second quarter sunday after a helmet to helmet hit following a 6 yard reception at least four rams stood chrebet up at the end of the play and defensive tackle brian young came over the top and hit chrebet in the head coach herman edwards said the jets would send a tape of the hit to the league for review two snaps later chrebet threw a block on defensive end grant wistrom and then lay on his back with his hands over his face mask that was his last play of the game edwards had no problem with kurt warner 's signing autographs with about four minutes left warner faxed a note of apology to edwards if his coach lets him sign autographs that 's fine with me edwards said i 'm writing him back saying it 's a good deed on your part
 for three straight years alonzo mourning has had to walk off his home court in miami while watching the hated knicks celebrate a playoff victory that ended the heat 's season he does not want it to happen a fourth time and based on the moves miami has been making recently there is a good chance it will not mourning was at the nba store in manhattan yesterday and he was naturally asked about the deals the heat has made or will soon make that will produce a starting lineup next season of mourning tim hardaway eddie jones anthony mason and brian grant it is a lineup that under the play hard or play elsewhere approach of coach pat riley may make things tough on everyone else in the eastern conference asked about the deals yesterday mourning said i had an idea but i did n't think it would be of this magnitude it looks good on paper but you do n't know until you hit the floor i hope we can develop some chemistry quickly and that these guys can learn riles 's system it 's the toughest system in the league mourning said he was excited that jones a 6 foot 6 inch guard had been acquired by the heat in a deal with charlotte that also brought mason to miami but forced the heat to give up pj brown and jamal mashburn jones is an all star in this league but people underestimate his defense mourning said he 's led the league in steals the last two years and that 's what we emphasize as for mason and grant who will soon go to the heat from portland in a three way deal that by league requirements can not be completed for another week mourning said the bigger the better mason knows riles 's system and that 's a help grant 's work ethic is impressive i see similarities to myself in him he 's got a great attitude and he gives such an all out hard nosed effort fred bierman
 mets general manager steve phillips spoke to the news media by telephone yesterday but the only announcement was a minor league transaction that shrunk the mets 40 man roster to 36 the mets have open spots and offers to pitchers to fill them but the coming weekend may be tense for the national league champions they have re signed only one player the reserve lenny harris and could lose their setup man john franco to the phillies who are growing anxious about whether he will accept their two year 9 million offer starter rick reed and reliever turk wendell two players who want to return to the mets also remain unsigned and the ace mike hampton is being heavily courted by 10 teams with the chicago cubs a strong contender i do n't think you can ever anticipate anything phillips said just as these players are competitive on the field they 're going to be competitive in the marketplace i do n't think anybody is going to hand themselves over for nothing then phillips joked about wendell 's fanciful offer to play free or with his salary donated to charity if he signs a three year deal as the cubs and the mets have offered him there is not much else to joke about phillips is spending most of his time on free agents but that market has been frustrating with talks with reed and hampton stalled and the free agent bobby j jones apparently still a lesser priority the mets have no reliable starters besides al leiter and glendon rusch at this point a trade would be a fallback phillips said a deal for a starter like montreal 's dustin hermanson who is available would probably happen later i could make a couple of deals now but i 've got to see where the free agent market goes with ours as well as others phillips said denny neagle remains a possibility for the mets who surely remember his eight solid years in the national league more than his struggles for the yankees down the stretch last season while not acknowledging if the mets have made an offer neagle 's agent barry meister was enthusiastic about the mets as a possibility i think they 're still a good fit meister said yesterday we do n't know exactly how it 'll tumble out but we 're hoping to do something by next week we have definite interest in them we 'll keep talking to all clubs and winnow things down in the next 7 to 10 days neagle could command 10 million a year as could another free agent darren dreifort of the dodgers who has interested the mets in the past the former met right hander armando reynoso of the diamondbacks is another free agent who could emerge as a less expensive option while pitching is dominating the mets attention they are also trying to acquire a left handed hitter milwaukee 's jeromy burnitz may be available in a trade but he wants a big contract extension florida outfielder henry rodriguez heads a thin free agent crowd of productive left handed hitters the best hitter on the market of course is seattle shortstop alex rodriguez a right handed batter there is some thought in baseball that the mets may try to reopen negotiations covertly but the mets public withdrawal last week wounded rodriguez 's feelings and it is highly unlikely that he would consider them again publicly the mets say that feeling is mutual i do n't anticipate anything that would change that would make us reconsider it phillips said the delay in franco 's decision may be a good sign for the mets the phillies have made it clear to franco that he is their first choice to turn around their bullpen but baseball officials indicated that the phillies may be close to giving him a deadline for a decision if franco does not sign with the phillies they will probably go with a closer by committee the mets have offered franco two years and 7 million according to one official and they apparently will not match the phillies offer franco would close games in philadelphia but set up saves in flushing closers salaries are different than setup men 's salaries phillips said everything being equal i would think johnny would stay here but things are n't equal because of the role inside pitch the san diego padres claimed the right handed pitcher jason middlebrook off waivers from the mets yesterday the mets had claimed him off waivers from the padres last month
 to the editor in a prompt for the conscience april 28 county executive andrew j spano suggests that people without disabilities who park in handicapped spaces can be dissuaded from doing so by asking them in a friendly neighborly way to park some place else mr spano 's suggestion is hopelessly naive as someone with multiple sclerosis who must use a scooter i find that gentle dissuasion has no effect whatsoever on a person inconsiderate enough to hijack a handicapped space in the first place replies i have received at least those that are fit to print have ranged from mind your own business to shut up to go take a walk not only was the woman who said the latter words to me perfectly ambulatory while i was sitting in a scooter but she then loudly complained to a friend she has some nerve she does n't know my husband is an invalid her husband was not with her yet she still felt entitled to a handicapped space a perfect example of the permit abuse described in your article the problem does n't end with the selfish behavior of nondisabled drivers i am also routinely frustrated at having to park in absurdly narrow or snow filled handicapped spaces and where are the curb cuts i find a spot get out of my van and then have no way of getting onto the sidewalk the lack of adequate accessible spaces as well as considerate people has left me doubly handicapped beth weiler scarsdale

 senate democrats began a filibuster today speaking on the senate floor without respite to block a vote on president bush 's nomination of miguel estrada to a federal appeals court in washington the democrats said they had not been given enough information to assess his views but they said they believed that he held extreme conservative positions that could tilt the appeals court far to the right for their part republicans responded defiantly talk all you want we wo n't stop you said senator rick santorum of pennsylvania the republican conference chairman but mr santorum warned be prepared to stay here through a planned recess and keep talking congress is out next week for the president 's day recess it remains unclear whether the current procedure will resemble those of old in which filibustering senators engaged in marathon oratorical sessions to to put off a vote but for now other senate business has come to a halt over the nomination of mr estrada a 42 year old washington lawyer named by mr bush to a seat on the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit widely seen as second in importance only to the supreme court with a 51 member majority in the 100 member senate republicans have the votes to confirm mr estrada as the first hispanic judge on the appeals court in washington but they would need at least 9 democrats to reach the 60 votes needed to end the filibuster as the debate wore on today democrats complained repeatedly that mr estrada had refused to answer any questions at his confirmation hearing last year about his views senator tom daschle of south dakota the democratic leader told reporters mr estrada has been intransigent and unwilling to provide even the basic information that we must have if we 're going to make our assessment of his qualifications in a letter to president bush mr daschle asked that mr estrada answer questions to which he declined to respond at his sept 26 hearing like which supreme court opinions he disagreed with and which judges he would use as a model in addition mr daschle asked the white house to provide copies of legal memorandums mr estrada wrote while a lawyer in the office of solicitor general in which he assessed cases the government was arguing before the supreme court the white house has refused to release those documents saying that doing so would discourage government lawyers from providing candid advice for fear that their views might later be disclosed and used against them but mr daschle said until that information is provided we will not be in a position to allow a vote to come to the senate floor president bush complained to reporters today a handful of democrats in the senate are playing politics with his nomination and it 's shameful politics he said he wanted mr estrada to get fairer treatment than he 's getting from those who are really against the spirit of the united states senate senator orrin g hatch the utah republican who is chairman of the judiciary committee said the contention that mr estrada was not responsive at his hearing was laughable he said democrats real problem was that his answers did n't give them any reason to oppose him mr hatch added he testified that he would follow binding precedent and that nothing in his personal views would interfere with his ability to follow the law most judicial candidates decline to discuss many of their personal views but mr estrada was a little more reticent than most saying he could not discuss some well known cases because he had not read the briefs or heard the oral arguments mr hatch also noted that mr estrada had argued 15 cases before the supreme court and that his candidacy had received high marks from the american bar association senator charles e schumer the new york democrat who has been leading the effort to block a vote on the estrada nomination said the filibuster transcended mr estrada the issue he said is whether the advise and consent process in the selection of judges is going to be obliterated the situation carries political perils for both sides democrats have seized on mr estrada as an example of mr bush 's efforts to pack the courts with conservative judges republicans have begun to try to portray democrats as standing in the way of the advancement of an accomplished hispanic lawyer
 the craziness just goes on and on season after season the mets are in hot pursuit of tom glavine nothing new there the mets have been chasing glavine and the atlanta braves for a decade in what has been major league baseball 's version of a road runner cartoon no matter what the mets do or do n't do the shifty speedy braves have an answer an antidote or a formula that leaves the mets grasping at air or falling flat on their faces this time the mets are going after glavine one of the pillars of atlanta 's pitching dynasty they might get him and therein lies the problem should they rush in and make glavine the trophy of their off season safari i 'd advise caution for 10 years the mets have been outmaneuvered by john schuerholz the braves general manager and this may be another of his cagey moves glavine was 18 11 last season but pitched poorly in the playoffs his postseason performance an 0 2 record and 13 runs allowed in seven and two thirds innings might not have been an aberration it might have been the beginning of a decline that typically for the mets would accelerate if he joined them this season has to be either the end for steve phillips the mets general manager or the beginning of his and the team 's turnaround for the mets to reach another level phillips has to move beyond ok with the mets payroll ok is not good enough despite lots of talent the mets finished last in the national league east last season the team 's signature was weak hitting inconsistent pitching atrocious fielding and questionable effort art howe was a good choice to replace bobby valentine as manager in seven seasons howe made a young hungry team with lots to prove into a dynamo his oakland teams reached the playoffs the past three years the mets that howe inherited are neither young nor hungry they are well paid and pudgy where does glavine fit in he is 36 he has spent his entire 16 year career with atlanta he is 242 143 can he reach 300 victories with this mets team which is like a ghost ship full of players who seem to be shells of themselves maybe glavine is just a shell of himself maybe that 's why atlanta is contemplating letting him walk after all these years this is what phillips and fred wilpon have to figure out in this game of chess is glavine an unprotected overlooked piece or is he part of a grand trap forget how the mets have been outplayed by atlanta on the field the mets have been clobbered by atlanta in the front office as well schuerholz has outmaneuvered the mets at every turn he snatches up the right free agent calls up the right player at the right time signs veterans at the right time since 1993 with glavine greg maddux and john smoltz the braves have had one of the best pitching staffs in baseball last season atlanta added gary sheffield the mets added mo vaughn atlanta added crucial role players the mets added stars on the decline now atlanta is watching the mets scramble after glavine the mets have proposed a three year deal at 285 million yesterday team glavine countered with a four year 45 million contract if i were the mets i 'd look at atlanta and do what it does schuerholz who knows glavine better than anyone else is offering a two year deal with a team option for 2005 in fact atlanta seems to hold the hammer schuerholz recently pulled off a deal with florida and colorado to acquire mike hampton the tough 30 year old pitcher who had two frustrating seasons in colorado somehow you just know that hampton is going to be revitalized in atlanta we believe he will benefit from our environment schuerholz said phillips can not say the same thing about glavine in fact the mets want glavine to provide a new atmosphere wilpon has cast glavine as the new face of the mets but the team needs an overhaul not a new face the mets pursuit of glavine is understandable but wrongheaded wilpon in his first off season as the sole owner of the mets is valiantly trying to repair the damage from last season in a steinbrennian maneuver he has rolled out the carpet for glavine a player he fancies as part savior part spark plug and part stabilizer for the mets but wilpon is barking up the wrong tree what he needs to be asking is when will schuerholz become a free agent

 the yankees were gagging this weekend gasping for air in a season that they keep treating too cavalierly they are up then they fall down they are in then they are stumbling out the yankees have performed like the sybil of baseball teams lately one personality expecting something good to happen and the other expecting something bad to happen october is no time to be so unpredictable teams can not blink in the three of five game division series or they can suddenly be sitting next to the atlanta braves ordering mozzarella sticks with those chicken fingers as the postseason unfolds on television before their disappointed eyes the yankees should realize that maybe the yankees finally do after stopping the athletics 7 5 last night to win a tense division series in five games the yankees gave andy pettitte a 6 0 bulge before he lifted his right leg and began his pitching motion for the first time but they still added unnecessary drama the a 's would not go to sleep quietly or more accurately pettitte could not silence them when your most successful starting pitcher has a six run lead in the first inning against a team he has beaten three times this season it is supposed to be a calm night chill the champagne wrap the plastic around the lockers and take ticket orders for the american league championship series it should have been that simple for the yankees nothing has come easily for us this year said bernie williams after a subdued celebration nothing the yankees have been a wayward team for the last month tip toeing along like a toddler along a beach not sure if he wants to get his feet wet the toddler walks along the edge and waits but sometimes he is not ready and he gets splashed the yankees have looked like that toddler obviously this sloppy approach can not continue if the yankees expect to win their third straight world series title manager joe torre has such scant confidence in his middle relievers that he used mike stanton normally a setup man in the fourth inning jeff nelson another setup man in the sixth and orlando hernandez a starter who won game 3 for one out in the eighth mariano rivera notched the last five outs and saved all three victories arriving in the eighth inning each time in the five years that i 've been here this is the toughest series we played derek jeter said we battled they battled this is a relief there is no timo perez on the yankees but their heroes last night were unusual chuck knoblauch who spent more time talking to friends than fielding grounders before game 4 on saturday returned to the lineup and poked two singles during a six run first after being benched in game 2 knoblauch said i guess i might not play in the postseason again but knoblauch did and the yankees needed him and the bullpen saved the season by following pettitte and retiring 16 of the last 19 batters who said we 're too old stanton shouted we 're just old enough pettitte stopped the a 's 4 0 in the second game of the series and was 2 0 with a 106 earned run average against them during the regular season someone wondered if the a 's would feel more comfortable because they had opposed pettitte four days ago we used to face koufax a lot torre countered it did n't do us a bit of good but even koufax lost pettitte was uncomfortable as the a 's scored two two out runs in the second inning one run in the third and two more in a dangerous fourth when the yankees tumbled to the indians in game 5 in 1997 the last time they faced elimination pettitte let omar vizquel rattle him at the plate and on the bases and it helped lead to a crushing 4 0 deficit tonight the a 's trimmed the deficit to 7 5 and if one of their two sacrifice flies had soared into a gap in the fourth pettitte might have fizzled again every time i started to lose perspective i looked at the scoreboard and we were still ahead torre said as the yankees took batting practice yesterday at the network associates coliseum they were a little bleary eyed because they had landed in san francisco about 6 30 am eastern time for a game they had desperately wanted to avoid but the yankees definitely awakened when an interview with oakland 's eric chavez was shown on the right field scoreboard chavez was asked about ending the yankees successful run i do n't mind at all chavez said i mean they 've won enough times it 's time for some other people to have some glory here but no they had a great run had that chavez spoke in the past tense irritated several yankees i think it 's fitting that the last out was from the guy who insinuated that we were over the hill williams said it 's my understanding that we 're not done yet after the 1997 loss george steinbrenner circled the clubhouse and bellowed we 'll win it next year mark it down they did would george dare say that the erratic yankees will threepeat this season the yankees could because they can handle the mariners and they should not fear the mets or the cardinals the sybil of baseball teams has to find a winning personality and maintain it after all it is october teams must make good things happen
 the plans and hopes of other teams aside this baseball year could end in no better manner than to have the arizona diamondbacks and the boston red sox win their respective league pennants so that randy johnson and pedro martinez can pitch against each other in games 1 4 and 7 of the world series what more fitting climax could the season have than to put the premier pitcher in each league on the mound in the sport 's ultimate set of games although that 's the only way johnson and martinez could pitch in the same meaningful games they have been mirroring each other this season making four starts on the same day and another start on consecutive days in their latest turns in their teams rotations johnson is scheduled to pitch against san diego tonight and martinez against tampa bay tomorrow afternoon johnson the left hander will take a 6 0 record and a 091 earned run average into the game in phoenix martinez the right hander will take a 5 0 record and a 127 era into his game in boston martinez has made one fewer start than johnson because the red sox were rained out for four consecutive days last month both pitchers have been no less than terrific they clearly have become the most dominating most intimidating pitchers in their respective leagues the similarities are they are both intimidating mike hargrove the baltimore orioles manager said by telephone yesterday the differences are how they go about it hargrove was asked to compare the two pitchers because as a long time american league manager he has had to deal with both during the regular season and in playoff games randy is physically intimidating hargrove said here 's a guy 6 foot 12 or whatever he is 6 10 and when he lets the ball go it looks like he lets it go halfway to the plate that 's intimidating especially to left hand hitters pedro goes about his business quietly on the mound but there 's no doubt in your mind that pedro feels he owns the entire plate and if you try to take any of it away from him he 'll come and get you that 's what martinez did last sunday in cleveland with einar diaz his brushback pitch led to an exchange of hit batters and a five game suspension for martinez if his appeal is unsuccessful he presumably will fall another start behind johnson though not necessarily in stature and success johnson 36 years old leads the national league in victories era strikeouts 64 strikeouts per nine innings 117 batting average against 156 complete games 3 and shutouts 2 martinez 28 is tied for the al lead in victories and leads the league in era strikeouts 50 strikeouts per nine innings 127 and opponents batting average 173 neither has lost a regular season game since last august though the mets beat johnson in a playoff game last october since he lost last aug 31 johnson has started 11 games and been the winning pitcher nine times martinez has not incurred a loss since last aug 19 winning 11 of 12 starts and adding one victory each as a starter and a reliever in last year 's playoffs johnson 17 9 248 and martinez 23 4 207 were the 1999 cy young award winners jim beattie general manager of the montreal expos knows both pitchers intimately he was in the seattle front office when johnson pitched for the mariners and he was the expos general manager who traded martinez to the red sox they both have a lot of confidence beattie said they do n't let anything bother them randy is more emotional out there but it does n't affect how he throws his next pitch it 's the same with pedro they 've gotten past those things that 's the mark of a good pitcher beattie a former pitcher himself said neither johnson nor martinez was born on the pitching pinnacle they worked hard to get there it was probably 1994 '95 when randy started to step it up and concentrate beattie said he worked hard in the off season he started applying himself and got stronger the same with pedro he worked hard conditioning for both these guys is outstanding people who do n't know the pitchers beattie suggested might look at both pitchers and think johnson was just this tall skinny guy and martinez was a small skinny guy both however are very strong he said you saw the maturing of both into the pitchers they have become the expos executive said both had questions about them early in their career but they developed mental toughness and concentration it 's something they learned as they got more experienced early in his career after the los angeles dodgers decided he was too small to become a good major league pitcher and traded him to the expos martinez was accused of being a headhunter he hit batters with pitches liberally and the batters went after him i do n't think he was a headhunter beattie said i think his ball just ran so much that he ended up hitting a lot of guys he has refined the way he approaches the game so has randy russ davis a san francisco infielder played with johnson in seattle and has played against him as a member of the yankees and the giants he 's gotten so good right now said davis who does n't have a hit in 11 at bats against johnson i do n't ever remember him throwing a sinking fastball a two seamer that just runs away from right handers now i thought that was pretty incredible when he came here and i saw that other than that pitch everything 's real hard a hard slider it 's hard to detect if it 's a fastball or a slider and he pitches he 's not just throwing 95 every time it 's like he 's getting better with age with time hargrove has n't had to deal with johnson since he left the american league during the 1998 season sight unseen though the baltimore manager said johnson is the best pitcher in the national league but he added without a doubt i think pedro 's the best in both leagues he 's kind of a combination of maddux and johnson he has johnson 's fastball but maddux 's composure and control

 betsy werronen has heard most of the jokes before the one about how being a republican party organizer in washington is like being an air conditioner repairman in alaska or how republicans are outnumbered here like general custer 's scouts at little bighorn or how a republican has as much chance of being elected mayor of the nation 's capital as does saddam hussein mrs werronen chairwoman of the dc republican committee admits that when she took the job last month of running the party 's local organization people thought i was nuts some people think it 's hopeless you actually want to do this she remembers being asked are you crazy during a quick trip home from philadelphia where she is leading the city 's delegation to the republican national convention this week she says that when she introduces herself to other convention delegates some of them kind of roll their eyes when they hear that she is from what may be the democratic party 's strongest urban stronghold we 've got a real challenge mrs werronen says in a bit of the classic understatement that she learned after a career in both public relations and state department diplomacy are we going to deliver the district of columbia for george w bush she asks no but i would just love to bring the republican vote up by a few percentage points in a city that is the workplace of many of the nation 's most prominent republican politicians the local party seems barely to exist in washington registered democrats outnumber registered republicans by more than 10 to 1 256300 democrats versus 24500 republicans there are many more registered independents in the city 45800 than republicans in half of the city 's eight wards the republicans are not contesting city council races this fall the result is de facto one party rule by the democrats which mrs werronen says she is determined to change in her two year term although they blame the federal government 's meddling for many of the capital 's problems democrats concede that their record of leadership here is a checkered one in the 1990 's the city became a symbol of urban decay during 16 years in power mayor marion s barry jr who ran the democratic machine until he retired last year oversaw a city in which the school system and other services came close to collapse yet mr barry was re elected in 1994 even after serving a six month prison term for drug use mrs werronen insists that as the crime rate and the abundant potholes seemed to push the city close to the abyss a few years ago she never once thought of leaving when i came to washington dc i knew i was going to live in washington dc says mrs werronen whose home is a 150 year old town house in georgetown which she shares with her husband henry and two cockerpoos one of two children of a parks commissioner in brookline mass mrs werronen now 57 moved to washington in 1965 the year she graduated from boston college and went to work for the republican national committee from 1968 until 1975 she worked for senator edward w brooke the massachusetts republican for most of the 1980 's she worked at the state department where for a time she oversaw congressional relations in 1989 she founded a public relations and consulting firm she married her husband a health care consultant and art collector seven years ago mrs werronen says the city 's traditional democratic voters should be open to the republican party i really do feel that the democratic party has failed many of the people they tried to help in this city she said and bush is different he is inclusive sure he 's got some very conservative positions but he is inclusive an early backer of mr bush she says that she disagrees with him on a central issue while the party platform seeks a ban on abortions she favors abortion rights i think that politically and legally you 've got to have choice she said but there 's not going to be any candidate that anyone can support on 100 percent of the issues mrs werronen admits that part of the republican party 's problem here is one of image and that 's our fault she says in a city that is two thirds black some people perceive republicans here as lily white little old ladies in tennis shoes so mrs werronen has decided to move local party gatherings out of mostly white neighborhoods to churches and other gathering points in neighborhoods populated mostly by blacks we 've got to get out there she says we 're going to get people out there and talk to them the party has established a web site wwwdcgopcom and it has stepped up fund raising efforts allowing the committee 's annual budget to grow to 130000 this year from about 50000 two years ago in the past she said there had been a tendency not to ask individuals for money because they all thought it was going down a rat hole and she is trying to reach out to other constituencies including the city 's powerful asian american hispanic and gay voters asked if she can imagine a republican mayor of washington someday she says absolutely and then singles out a likely candidate david catania a popular member of the city council who happens to be gay i 'm a big tent republican she says we 've got a little bit of everything in our party and i want them all to be comfortable
 the mets are getting outstanding pitching from their rotation and their bullpen their hits have been well timed their defense is sparkling the mets took another game from the arizona diamondbacks tonight 6 2 and they have won 10 of their last 11 to move three games behind the first place atlanta braves in the national league east that is the closest to first place the mets have been since the all star game break and it would take a drastic blow to sour their spirits that almost happened tonight when catcher mike piazza had to leave the game in the fourth inning piazza sprained his left knee while crossing first base on a close play in the fourth he came back to the field to catch in the bottom of the inning but his mobility was limited and he was removed before bobby jones 's first pitch of the inning piazza has missed games this year because of a home plate collision a backswing and a beanball but it is not known if the knee injury will force him from the lineup x rays taken at bank one ballpark were negative and the mets listed piazza day to day while piazza was being examined the mets were finishing off the diamondbacks in the second game of this series and extending their winning streak over arizona to seven games dating to the division series last fall jones worked six effective innings allowing two runs eight hits and two walks to improve to 6 5 removing the rookie grant roberts 's rough start in a cameo role the mets starters are 8 1 with a 225 earned run average over the last 11 games jones who had tossed a complete game in his previous start continued his impressive turnaround in nine starts since a mid june stint at class aaa norfolk jones is 5 2 with a 303 era for arizona the 27 year old geraldo guzman was making the fifth major league start of an improbable career that started in the montreal expos system in 1989 guzman was released after injuring his shoulder the following season and he spent the next seven years working as a carpenter in his native dominican republic a diamondbacks scout suggested he take up baseball again and the club eventually invited him to its dominican academy from there guzman joined a team in taiwan played winter ball in the dominican republic and so impressed the diamondbacks that they signed him and added him to their 40 man roster guzman started this season in the bullpen at class aa el paso and made it to the majors before the all star game break he was 3 1 in his first four starts with arizona the mets knew little of him before the game but they figured him out instantly the first four hitters singled bringing in two runs but guzman set down the next three hitters and after issuing a leadoff walk in the second he was helped when jones failed to get a bunt down guzman recorded a pair of strikeouts to get out of the second and also struck out two in the third he got two quick outs in the fourth then did something no pitcher has done this season he walked jones the mets right hander was 0 for 25 this season with no walks but he took four consecutive balls from guzman then took two bases when lenny harris singled to right with runners at the corners derek bell lined a double to left over the head of luis gonzalez who hesitated before going back on the ball the hit brought in jones and edgardo alfonzo then singled home another run to put the mets ahead 4 1 piazza came up and grounded sharply down the third base line matt williams a four time gold glove winner fielded it four steps into foul territory then rifled a throw across the infield to cut down piazza piazza crossed the bag at full speed then dropped to a squat for a moment and briefly protested the call he came out to catch in the bottom of the fourth but had to leave the field before a pitch was thrown replacing piazza was todd pratt whose home run clinched the mets division series victory over arizona last october there were 41656 fans at bank one ballpark tonight but incredibly none seemed to react when pratt 's name was announced but if fans at the 3 year old stadium do not often boo they had nothing but cheers for randy johnson when he was pulled in the fourth inning of friday 's game after allowing five runs on eight hits they do appreciate great plays with two outs in the sixth bell smoked a pitch just to the right of center field steve finley sprinted for it then stretched his arm and snared the ball just before reaching the wall about 410 feet from home plate finley trotted in to an extended ovation then earned more cheers when he pulled a curveball from jones inside the right field foul pole leading off the bottom of the inning the homer was finley 's 28th of the season and snapped a 20 game homerless streak it cut the mets lead to 4 2 the mets widened their lead to 6 2 in the seventh when robin ventura lined a two run homer

 a member of the united states olympic committee has resigned to protest its refusal to discipline the chief executive officer lloyd ward for using a staff member to assist his brother 's business venture the committee member brian derwin a former olympic weight lifter wrote in a letter to marty mankamyer the usoc president i thought we had an opportunity to hold ourselves to a higher standard and we did not derwin who joined the usoc 's executive committee in 2000 wrote that monday 's decision not to discipline ward did not address the underlying distrust and dysfunction in the usoc he added i can not in good conscience ask the athletes to hold themselves to a higher standard than the executive committee would hold itself the executive committee took no action against ward despite an ethics oversight committee report that said his actions created the appearance of a conflict of interest derwin was one of four members who dissented from the executive committee 's endorsement of the ethics report with ward and mankamyer abstaining 19 of 21 committee members voted the committee did not address the ethical questions raised by ward 's actions and said the report 's findings would be addressed by the usoc 's compensation committee during ward 's performance review derwin was so angered by the decision that he quit on the spot in a suburban denver hotel meeting room and seethed in the lobby before leaving he later sent the resignation letter in which he said he believed there was a clear conflict of interest violation in ward 's use of a usoc staff member to help energy management technologies where his brother rubert was president it had made a proposal to supply microturbines for backup power at the 2003 pan american games derwin said the matter should not be shuffled to the compensation committee jim mccarthy an executive committee member said this is a sad and major loss brian 's integrity was unquestioned a second executive committee member who spoke on the condition of anonymity said brian 's positions were principled and on target it 's a very telling sign when someone of his integrity resigns derwin declined to elaborate on the letter yesterday the usoc 's ethics code says that because the appearance of impropriety can be just as damaging as actual impropriety conduct which appears to be improper is also unacceptable it also states that the usoc staff is required to avoid conflicts of interest both real and perceived and that even the appearance of misconduct or impropriety can be very damaging to the reputation of the usoc derwin held several usoc positions including chairman of the antidoping policy committee
 vinny testaverde will come and go play a series or two chip off the rust and check the health of his thumb in the jets preseason opener thursday night against the pittsburgh steelers then the real show will start often when a backup quarterback enters a preseason game the channel is switched not this year testaverde whose thumb is sore but functional will take a dozen snaps then one of the most eagerly awaited understudies in football chad pennington will finally get a chance to display all the progress the jets say he has made if this ends up being testaverde 's final season as a starter then this is pennington 's best chance to prove that whatever concerns the jets had last season about his viability as a starter have long since disappeared because testaverde is the unquestioned starter and pennington has attempted only 25 passes in regular season games the jets have pointed to their four preseason games as an opportunity to give pennington work and to gauge his progress pennington will play at least two quarters thursday and much of his time will come with the starting offensive line albeit a patchwork unit right now and the starting receivers i do n't have anything to prove or anything to show pennington said i know what i have deep down inside it 's time to let it all hang out that bit of swagger is what the jets have longed to unearth in pennington and what he has finally allowed to seep out this summer pennington 's play seemed to turn the corner after coach herman edwards said during minicamp in april that he still thought the quarterback was thinking too much the jets have implored him for a year to play as if he were on the sandlot to worry less about making mistakes and to just wing the ball during team workouts in june pennington seemed freer yet more in control while taking all the snaps with the first team while testaverde recovered from foot surgery in training camp he has been more confident and less hesitant about throwing while the quarterbacks will have the luxury of throwing to receiver santana moss who is completely healthy for the first time in his jets career testaverde and pennington will have to contend with the makeshift offensive line which will limit how deep in the playbook the jets venture with center kevin mawae and right guard randy thomas out with shoulder injuries there are four new starters on the offensive line the rookie jonathan goodwin at left guard j p machado at center dan goodspeed who was signed from the san francisco practice squad last december at right guard and kareem mckenzie a first year starter at right tackle the quick dump pass can not go quickly enough you have to understand who is in front of him edwards said of pennington we do n't want to put him in a situation where your team gets the ball and he 's running for his life this is when you gain your confidence when chad drops back he has to see someone is open and just throw it he has done that the last month and a half and now he has to do it in a game pennington knows that until he does it in a game the questions about his future as the jets starter will linger his performance in the 2001 preseason did little to ease those concerns which is why the jets have pointed to these games since the end of last season as a training ground for pennington in two preseasons pennington is 56 of 97 for 735 yards with a touchdown and 2 interceptions everybody 's wondering what 's going to happen with chad pennington said about himself is he ready i do n't know i have to prove it on the field nobody knows what chad pennington can do on the field because we have n't seen chad pennington on the field i have two roles my first role is similar to last year and the year before it 's a backup role but my second role is to be ready to become the starter if that ever happens extra points linebacker sam cowart hamstring who has not practiced since the first day of training camp will not make the trip to pittsburgh john abraham knee dave szott knee and david viger calf will not travel either edwards said he was not disappointed that cowart who is returning from an achilles tear last season is still not well it would be more disappointing if we lost him for the year edwards said right guard randy thomas shoulder and offensive tackle jumbo elliott quadriceps will not play but will make the trip the rookie defensive end bryan thomas will play with the first team defense on the nickel package but will play on first and second downs with the second team defense edwards said he wanted to see how thomas played against the run the defensive starters will play 10 to 15 snaps tory woodbury will take over for chad pennington at quarterback in the middle of the third quarter the jets met with mark bartelstein the agent for kevin mawae to begin negotiations on a new contract mawae is eligible to become a free agent after the season
 the nasa administrator defended himself today against suggestions in the columbia accident report that the agency had cut corners to meet a schedule he had imposed and he promised that the agency would achieve the major change called for in the report fixing its culture to one more amenable to safety concerns we get it the administrator sean o'keefe said using that phrase five times in the course of a 90 minute meeting with reporters to indicate that he understood that the problem with nasa was not the foam that fell on the columbia 's wing on liftoff or any other hardware issue but the cluster of attitudes and behaviors that led it to overlook the problem for years mr o'keefe said he thought nasa personnel who had safety questions felt free to speak up but he said some did so by e mailing him directly a sign that they do not feel comfortable raising questions with their immediate superiors the process to permit that discussion is n't happening at every level he said he said schedules notably for meeting milestones for assembling the international space station were a very valuable management tool but nothing more asked if he would resign he said twice he was personally accountable for what went wrong but he also said he served at the pleasure of the president president bush 's statement on tuesday about the shuttle report said that the next steps would be determined under sean o'keefe 's leadership which in washington usage meant that the white house did not want him to leave while the report named few names and explicitly avoided the idea of personal guilt for the feb 1 crash of the columbia hearings run by lawmakers who are more eager to establish blame will begin on sept 4 when the house science committee will hear from harold w gehman jr the retired admiral who is chairman of the commission that produced the shuttle report and several of the commission 's 12 other members the hearings will probably continue through the fall at the time of nasa 's first major accident the fire in january 1967 that killed three astronauts in a training drill in an apollo capsule on the launching pad the agency was led by james e webb then completing his sixth year on the job mr webb left in october of 1968 and his official nasa biography says he was personally tarred with the disaster at the time of the loss of the challenger the shuttle that was destroyed on liftoff in january 1986 nasa was led by an interim administrator william r graham who left office soon after the report on the loss of the columbia released on tuesday cited many contributing causes but said the launching schedule had become ever more compressed because of the plan to launch a critical section of the space station called node 2 by feb 19 2004 nasa employees told the investigators that the deadline came from mr o'keefe the report said and was part of a plan that he had proposed when he was deputy director of the white house office of management and budget his job before becoming nasa administrator in december 2001 the date seemed etched in stone the report said and nasa employees had a sense of being under the gun i was n't convinced that people were being given enough time to work the problems correctly one worker told the investigators in that atmosphere the report said a big chunk of foam fell off in an october 2002 launching and was classified as an action not an in flight anomaly had it been called an anomaly it would have received much more attention before the next launching that of the fatal columbia flight but mr o'keefe said today that since he took the job no shuttle launching had taken place on schedule and that there was no undue pressure schedules and milestone objectives are important management goals in order to achieve outcomes he said he called them an appropriate and necessary way to go about doing business and he said the agency would not rush back into flight it has plans to launch the next shuttle around the end of the first quarter of next year but he said today when we are fit to fly that 's when that milestone will be achieved william f readdy the associate administrator for space flight speaking to reporters in the lobby of nasa headquarters after mr o'keefe 's briefing said there was nothing wrong with deadlines and that nasa 's were less serious than many others do you all have deadlines he asked the reporters do you get to slip your articles if they are not ready we do he said referring to launching delays the sept 4 hearing is expected to explore schedule pressures and nasa 's contracts with the private companies that do much of the work on the space program which offer bonuses for on time launchings mr o'keefe said nasa had made an absolute solemn promise to the families of the seven columbia crew members and others to return to space exploration one finding in the accident report was that nasa 's ambitions have exceeded its budget asked today what it would cost to fulfill the recommendations of the investigation board as he has pledged to do mr o'keefe said it was too early to estimate mr o'keefe said he had spent four hours on tuesday with admiral gehman and other members of the board discussing the findings he has not finished reading the 248 page report he said but on his first look through it he found nothing surprising because it was similar to the statements made by the investigators over the last few months among nasa employees today the report was topic a asked if the broadside from the board had hurt morale one johnson space center shuttle engineer replied what morale then laughed and added no we 're doing pretty good he added mostly i have great trepidation about where we go after this who is going to lead us out of this o'keefe is probably going to keep us alive but who 's going to lead us out of here employees at kennedy space center in florida were also caught up in the report one engineer who has been working with the accident investigators on the analysis of shuttle debris said it had been a busy couple of days because everyone was trying to work and read the dense report too i printed it out yesterday and started going through it the engineer said we take a little time out to read it a little bit and then you dive back into what you were doing the report poses a challenge for nasa said the engineer who added everything 's out in the open now so what do we do to fix things

 lesa france kennedy started at the bottom of her family business literally as a child one of her duties was to help wipe down the seats at the daytona international speedway before races so that the customers would n't get dirt on their bottoms it was a great proving ground for a young motor sports executive whose job now entails overseeing much of what goes on at the 11 tracks that are a part of the international speedway corporation based in daytona beach fla mrs kennedy 38 is the daughter of bill france jr president of nascar and chairman of international speedway and the granddaughter of bill france sr nascar 's founder her brother brian france is senior vice president of nascar the privately held business that governs stock car racing her upbringing included learning to drive on the daytona straightaways as executive vice president and a member of the board of international speedway mrs kennedy is a top aide to her uncle james france president of the company that makes mrs kennedy not only heir apparent but also one of the highest ranking women in an industry long dominated by men in the high octane high testosterone world of motor sports mrs kennedy is in the fast lane she 's extremely bright has incredible street smarts and her people skills are outstanding said jim hunter president of darlington raceway in darlington sc one of the 11 tracks owned by international speedway she 's definitely opening doors for women in the sport she is also helping the sport overcome raffish regional roots to become viewed as wholesome family entertainment for the nation but mrs kennedy plays down her role as a pace setter for women it 's not my focus she said i do n't spend a lot of time thinking about it besides dealing with existing tracks mrs kennedy is trying to develop tracks in the kansas city chicago and new york areas in new york the frances are working with donald j trump to find a track location most likely on long island or the new jersey meadowlands stock car racing has been growing rapidly and nascar has just negotiated a five year 2 billion television package international speedway bought seven tracks from roger penske in july and added the richmond international raceway in december making the company which is publicly traded the largest motor sports operator in the nation the moves were the boldest since international speedway was founded by bill france sr in 1953 five years after he incorporated nascar as much as mrs kennedy 's parentage furthered her career it was also a burden her biggest challenge has been trying to satisfy her father said mr hunter who has worked for the france family for 30 years anything less than terrific is just not acceptable to him i think that has made it tougher for her than it would for any other woman or man bill france jr he said has given his children every opportunity to get out of the business because he 's made them understand it from the restrooms up that extensive knowledge of the racing business and her attention to detail have won mrs kennedy credibility among her male counterparts nobody doubts her seriousness but she can also poke fun at her family and herself over a recent breakfast at the waldorf astoria a few days before the annual nascar awards banquet susan schandel her chief financial officer joked that running into mrs kennedy in the lobby could mean another chore rather than being able to go shopping mrs kennedy agreed but then reminded her that at times they both slipped away for some shopping mrs kennedy will need all her wit and charm to keep other track owners happy drivers say nascar has already scheduled as many races as they can handle but the other track owners want more races mrs kennedy said that other women in her family had schooled her in nascar 's macho demanding world her grandmother annie b france who operated the ticket office at daytona international speedway for many years encouraged her to pursue a career in the family business during breaks from duke university where she graduated in 1983 with bachelor of arts degrees in economics and psychology mrs kennedy worked in the daytona ticket office and in the complaint department it was great training experience because you were directly in touch with the fans mrs kennedy said you ca n't replace that with research it was problem resolution at the source you could hear their ideas and what they wanted from the sport people would come in and say 'we want to buy a t shirt where 's the gift shop we do n't have one build one and sell the merchandise it 's not quite rocket science but if you listen to the customers you ca n't go wrong that is where mrs kennedy came up with the idea for daytona usa a 20 million 50000 square foot year round entertainment complex at the racing track over the years she pulled together projections on construction costs researched the market and finally convinced her father her uncle and other senior executives that it was worth the risk it opened in 1996 and attracts about 500000 fans a year as assistant manager of the daytona speedway ticket office after she graduated she also pushed to computerize ticket sales at daytona that did n't fall easily on dinosaurs like myself said mr hunter who at the time was a vice president in marketing at nascar convincing us was no easy task because we had always done things the same way for years the big question was why should we change if it works her answers were because it 's cost effective it 's fast it 's efficient after working in the ticket office mrs kennedy moved over to international speedway in 1986 and worked in jobs throughout the company serving as secretary and treasurer before becoming executive vice president in 1996 mrs kennedy is married to dr bruce kennedy

 garner ted armstrong a silver haired television evangelist known for his easy charm and dark message died on monday in tyler tex he was 73 the cause was complications of pneumonia his son mark said mr armstrong was the son of the evangelist herbert w armstrong who called himself the only apostle of our time and used radio to build a ministry that eventually reached millions with its message of the imminent end of the world to be followed by the second coming of christ an advertising man he called his denomination the radio church of god garner ted armstrong took the story into the television age speaking extemporaneously and informally he brought wry humor to his apocalyptic forecasts which were routinely peppered with actual news reports of disasters he was at first reluctant to follow in his father 's footsteps but by the 1950 's had become the star of the radio and television programs of his father 's church by then renamed the worldwide church of god both programs were called the world tomorrow with the radio version heard on 360 stations on five continents and the television version seen by 20 million people on 165 stations in addition to spreading a spiritual message the church grew materially to include ambassador college in pasadena calif and a sizable publishing operation by the end of the 1970 's the new york times reported that it took in more than 70 million a year more than billy graham and oral roberts combined the narrative of mr armstrong 's life had elements of biblical stories and some that recalled elmer gantry the lustful evangelist of sinclair lewis 's novel the most dramatic event came in 1978 when his father excommunicated him because of doctrinal disagreements and accusations of sexual misconduct that were widely reported in the news media six years earlier he was taken off the air for four months after it was discovered that he had been engaged in an extramarital affair according to the reference book contemporary authors after his excommunication mr armstrong formed another church the church of god international but he was asked to step down as leader of that church in 1995 after a texas woman accused him of sexually assaulting her during two massage sessions he then formed the intercontinental church of god remaining its president until his death no criminal charges were ever filed in the incident but with each division mr armstrong 's reach lessened at the end he was on about 100 cable television stations and a handful of radio stations the rift with his father never healed in part because garner ted had accused herbert of stealing millions from his own church i tried repeatedly to call him and get in touch with him through letters but he refused to talk to me the younger mr armstrong said in an interview with the associated press at the time of his father 's death at 93 in 1986 my biggest regret is not being able to see my father face to face during these past years he said garner ted armstrong was born on feb 9 1930 in portland ore his father saw his birth as a miracle because his wife had recovered from an anemic condition shortly before he was born herbert armstrong dedicated his newborn son to god for him to use as he had need he said in his privately printed autobiography in october 1933 herbert made his first radio broadcast in salem ore early the next year he published the first plain truth magazine on mimeographed paper the theology he espoused was the same his son would later hold even as he moved between churches it blended fundamental christianity with some tenets of judaism and seventh day sabbath doctrine it departed from mainstream christianity in rejecting the trinity and regarding christmas and easter as pagan holidays it held that anglo saxons are the lineal descendants of the 10 lost tribes of israel members gave the church 10 percent to 40 percent of their income a tradition garner ted continued he graduated from high school in eugene ore in 1947 the year that his father moved his religious headquarters to pasadena because of the broadcasting facilities there mr armstrong joined the navy in 1948 partly to escape his father 's authority after his honorable discharge he worked in his father 's mail processing office he entered the church 's ambassador college in 1952 the next year he underwent a spiritual conversion and was baptized in his father 's church and married shirley hammer who survives him along with their sons mark david and matthew all live in tyler a daily feature on mr armstrong 's web site is news that may portend the end of the world yesterday 's report included a water crisis in the russian far east cholera in liberia and the death of 200 civilians in the congo

 nasa safety advisers said today that the agency should seriously study crew escape systems for the space shuttle and deploy them or re examine the high risk of human space flight in releasing its annual report to the space agency the experts the nasa aerospace safety advisory panel repeated earlier calls to study methods to allow a crew to escape a crippled shuttle at any point the panel which finished the report before the columbia accident on feb 1 that killed seven astronauts generally praised nasa as putting safety first but it criticized the agency for moving slowly on recommendations that it made in two previous reports to commit to building escape systems in past years the panel has been very concerned about the lack of crew escape systems appropriate to all regions of powered flight on board the space shuttle the nine member committee said it is clear that such systems will significantly increase the chance for crew survival in case of a major mishap the 106 page report covers the year immediately preceding the columbia accident and did not comment on it directly or the investigation into its cause in a meeting with the nasa administrator sean o'keefe the committee noted significant and inherent risks in flying the shuttle the agency is considering upgrades to systems that will improve safety including new power systems advanced electronics and new tires for the landing gear but the panel said the risk of losing another shuttle and its crew would remain high sidney m gutierrez a panel member who is a former shuttle astronaut and a former air force colonel said the risk of flying in the shuttle was significant on launching and returning to meet the agency 's stated safety goals for human space flight mr gutierrez said the answer would be a full crew escape system he said that the agency conducted early studies on an escape capsule that would enclose a entire crew and that the military had demonstrated that group and individual escape pods could be built that worked with high speed military aircraft noting that the shuttle had a demonstrated rate of catastrophic failure of one in 75 flights mr gutierrez added the agency could lose one or more of the three remaining shuttles if it continued to fly them until 2020 mr o'keefe said that the agency was working to make space flight safer and that the only way to eliminate the risk entirely was to stop flying a question to ask is can we tolerate the risk inherent in space exploration he said is the risk which is high acceptable as a consequence of being in an early phase of space exploration mr o'keefe cautioned against prematurely choosing one way of improving safety like escape pods nasa officials noted that the proposed orbital space plane which would carry crews but not cargo to and from the international space station is supposed to be much safer than the shuttle but early design requirements specify the desired levels of safety not ways to achieve it like escape pods the space officials said dr bernard a harris jr another former astronaut who is a consultant to the safety panel said nasa needed to change its view of crew safety dr harris agreed with mr gutierrez that the approach had been returning the crew safely by landing the spacecraft safely the focus he said should be on crew safety even if it means sacrificing the spacecraft

 even before the mets lost 8 5 to the reds yesterday tension was swirling through the mets clubhouse as catcher mike piazza denied a report that said he was unhappy with the team the record of hackensack nj citing two unnamed sources reported yesterday that piazza was so displeased with the mets direction and their plans to gradually move him to first base that he wanted to be traded possibly to an american league team so he could catch and be a designated hitter tom glavine the story suggested has told ownership that he does not want to have piazza catch him when approached by reporters piazza sounded occasionally agitated but mostly incredulous people close to me piazza said what people why are you wasting my time with this you 've got to be kidding me i guess i 'm the monkey this week that 's pretty funny piazza smiled and added you 've got to fill lines with something right it 's like i 'm not even playing and i 'm the monkey it 's kind of cute i guess it 's flattering really it 's kind of like how do you answer something so far fetched it really makes no sense referring to a newsday story last september that alleged widespread marijuana use on the team piazza said you 've got to drum up something this week nobody 's smoking pot or anything that 's pretty funny i do n't know where that came from obviously but it makes for debate i 'm just trying to get back on the field that 's my only priority right now to play i have n't even thought about anything else except that piazza has two years remaining on his contract and can veto any trade because he is a 10 year veteran who has played five years for his current team he has been on the disabled list since may when he tore a groin muscle in a game against the san francisco giants piazza expects to begin a rehabilitation assignment within two weeks and rejoin the mets next month jeff wilpon the mets chief operating officer and the son of the team owner fred wilpon held a news conference in the press box in the sixth inning to say ownership has no intention of trading mike and i do n't know where the story came from it 's unsubstantiated the same with glavine talking to me or talking to fred he has not talked to either one of us ever he 's had no conversations that would even intimate that 's his feelings or that 's what he wants to do wilpon who flew back from the baseball hall of fame in cooperstown ny said he last spoke to piazza on saturday and was confident piazza was open to trying first base wilpon said piazza has expressed no displeasure at the move not that he said 'i 'm not going to do it not that he said 'this is no good glavine called the report a joke it 's not something to be kept in house it should be talked about it 's irresponsible al leiter said piazza 's unhappiness was understandable he 's unhappy that he 's not playing and not able to perform leiter said that 's obvious to anybody yeah he 's upset and mad it 's not a happy moment for any of us i do n't see him as an extra or being outside of that circle of being unhappy with everything that 's gone on other than you can add the fact that he 's hurt and has n't been able to help several players echoed leiter 's thoughts but one said he envisioned piazza seeing first base as a looming issue that he tried to handle last week by expressing a willingness to play it the player who requested anonymity said he could understand how an uncertain future could cause piazza to consider the alternative of being a designated hitter rather than playing first base when he did not catch but that piazza had never expressed such a sentiment piazza was tired the player said of continually having to respond to such reports mets officials last week responded to piazza 's public comments about playing first base with a shrug saying that he had made similar remarks to them they felt piazza was sincere in his willingness to try first and his only resentment was that he felt moving there was an idea forced upon him by members of the news media one mets player privately suggested earlier this season that jason phillips 's on the job transformation from catcher to first baseman proved that the transition is possible the player also said that the mets would benefit from having opposing teams not feel like they could run at will which often was the case when piazza was behind the plate the game itself seemed like a footnote on a strange afternoon phillips 's 14 game hitting streak the longest by a met since edgardo alfonzo hit in 15 straight games in 2001 ended yesterday phillips went 0 for 4 steve trachsel allowed two of the reds three home runs and cliff floyd was hit above his right elbow for the second time in a week
 you have to admire the fortitude if not question the sanity of a nation that would put its political fate in the hands of two of the more despised groups in the land lawyers and journalists who in the last week have dominated our consciousness more than television 's talking heads and the candidates legal advisers it was n't enough that the networks mangled election night with the presidential campaign in overtime they have stirred an air of crisis through breathless wall to wall coverage even though the country seems to be bumping along as well or as poorly as ever meanwhile you practically need c130 's to carry all the lawyers parachuting into florida more than a few of them happen also to be politicians often enough so are the news people this is not exactly a new phenomenon still traditional lines separating the worlds of politics and journalism are being crossed and recrossed with some regularity these days when they are not being erased altogether consider patrick j buchanan the reform party candidate and chief beneficiary of those electorally challenged people in palm beach county fla now that mr buchanan 's presidential quest is over he may well recast himself as a television commentator or syndicated columnist he has done that several times before using his national audience to render political judgments while gearing up for his next run at the white house he has been in and out of cnn so many times that there must be a revolving door named after him in atlanta bay buchanan his sister and lead strategist said that for the next few months he 's looking at a couple of books after that he could be back to tv and radio also to writing a column she said though adding that nothing had been decided in other words do n't be surprised if mr buchanan winds up on the air yet again not that he is the only one to play this game geraldine a ferraro went from failed vice presidential candidate to crossfire sharpshooter to failed senate candidate then back and forth yet again before returning to the chattering class by now she deserves her own revolving door no sooner did alfonse m d'amato lose his senate seat from new york than he began shedding opinions left and right mostly right he now does a weekly pas de deux for new york magazine with another man who fell from electoral grace former mayor edward i koch political aides also get into the act tony blankley who tried to make newt gingrich an acquired taste works as a sunday morning kibitzer for nbc george stephanopoulos who helped give us president clinton does much the same for abc they are the political equivalents of baseball players who take refuge in the broadcasting booth after hanging up their spikes and who in some instances then scramble back into the game as team managers at least with messrs blankley and stephanopoulos the fence once hopped has stayed hopped for now at least they have followed in the tradition of more established commentators who once worked for politicians like bill moyers william safire diane sawyer and tim russert and what you may wonder is so terribly wrong with this form of switch hitting when did journalists become cloistered monks on that score you 'd get no argument from mitchell stephens who teaches journalism and mass communications at new york university if pat buchanan would want to take over dan rather 's anchor chair at cbs that would be a little odd he said but short of that i do n't have a problem tom goldstein dean of columbia university 's school of journalism would impose a one strike rule on the switch hitters i think you can go through the revolving door once in either direction he said then you have to make up your mind by his standards mr buchanan is damaged goods if you ask alex s jones director of harvard university 's joan shorenstein center on the press politics and public policy all this shuttling between back rooms and newsrooms is plain unpleasant not to mention bad news it tends to make people think that journalism is just about having opinions and not being fair and going after the truth he said mr jones will be allowed the last word a columnist 's prerogative of course you never know maybe with all these recounts mr buchanan will pick up enough votes to persuade him to stick to politics for good and give journalism a pass do n't bet the farm on it though

 by dismantling a once mighty but obliging tennessee team to capture the women 's basketball national championship the connecticut huskies did everything they had done so well during the season only this time they did it better i 've told these kids all year long that every pass we make in practice every cut every rebound pretend like it 's the one that 's going to win the national championship uconn coach geno auriemma said after his team celebrated its 71 52 victory against tennessee in sunday night 's national collegiate athletic association title game these kids have practiced like this all year long and the night that they had to do it they did it better than any other time in the season he said and the fact that we did it against a team as good as tennessee makes this an accomplishment all the more worthwhile because i know how hard it is to beat them the huskies 36 1 made a shocking spectacle out of the anticipated rubber match capping a near perfect season with a flawless performance they avenged their only loss of the season which came at home against tennessee by sticking to their steamrolling mentality while adopting the lady vols trademark defense as their own from the opening minutes uconn executed the fast break like a practice drill and spun the lady vols silly on backdoor cuts and with tennessee 's shooting guard kristen clement sidelined with a severely sprained ankle the huskies took advantage of the situation they were able to trap the lady vols young guards into 26 turnovers connecticut also frustrated tamika catchings the nation 's best collegiate player in limiting her to six shots while the rest of the lady vols missed easy baskets connecticut missed nothing or at least it seemed that way the huskies shot 508 percent from the floor and as they have done all season the huskies overwhelmed their opponent with a deep arsenal of talent from the bench such an imbalance made for bad theater but that might have been the only failing on a night when the huskies could do no wrong they started the season at no 1 and ended it in the same lofty place connecticut and tennessee 33 4 split the home and home series in the regular season with tennessee taking the most recent game in storrs conn when the huskies relinquished a 14 point lead they were not giving away anything sunday night shea ralph would not let them connecticut 's redshirt junior willed her team to the title flashing an out of my way glare ralph was determined to make those excruciating six hour sessions of rehabilitating her knees mean something i have worked so hard over these past two or three years and i have n't wanted anything as badly as i wanted it tonight ralph said after leading the huskies with 15 points 6 steals and 7 assists ralph 's all american teammate svetlana abrosimova contributed 14 points while the 6 foot 5 inch center kelly schumacher had nine blocks all three players are juniors point guard sue bird the magical ingredient in uconn 's chemistry this season is a sophomore so are the post players swin cash asjha jones and tamika williams the senior forwards stacy hansmeyer and paige sauer will graduate this year but the huskies will hardly notice what is more uconn will bring in four of the nation 's top freshmen next season i think next year it 's going to be even better because we know that we won a national championship so we just have to repeat that abrosimova said connecticut won its first title since the 1995 team went 35 0 and also beat tennessee for the crown that year the huskies used seven players this year they went with 10 and they will only get deeper tennessee returns all of its starters as well including catchings and clement without clement who averaged 56 points a game the lady vols lacked experience and emotion in the title game sunday would that have changed the outcome of this game tennessee coach pat summitt said i ca n't say that that would have happened she 's been our best defender on the perimeter when we started i thought it really affected our press offense throughout the game summitt bore a resigned look on the sideline her team was self destructing catchings did not score the first of her 16 points until there were four minutes left in the first half by then the game was already over semeka randall hit only 1 of her 11 shots no one played defense one game does n't mean your program is falling apart or that you ca n't be competitive at this level summitt said we are not going away i 'm certainly not on my way out and we 'll be back here hopefully again next year the championship was hyped as a potential groundbreaking event pitting the top two teams in the country but the final had no cosmic significance it was simply a game won by a team far better than any other right now i 'm sure the people at espn would have much preferred a double overtime game won on a 3 pointer at the buzzer and i apologize for that auriemma said half seriously the game itself does need more great rivalries connecticut tennessee is one it needs more

has been worth it when ms garrett speaks about hard times she is talking about her family 's two year stay in a queens shelter which began in 1998 though she struggled as a single mother she never imagined that she would be homeless the family used to have a comfortable apartment in jackson heights and as a correction officer ms garrett had no problem providing for her children but after 12 years she felt she needed a career change so she sent the children to the dominican republic where her parents lived she put her furniture in storage and moved in with a friend she had plans to enroll in school in the fall and she was thinking about a former supervisor 's suggestion that she consider a career in funeral work although she was unsure what she would study she had a plan for her family i wanted to go back to school save money and put down on a house she said but in a matter of months in the fall of 1998 her father developed heart problems and had to have surgery sent back to new york because they could no longer receive the proper care from their grandparents the children ages 5 through 12 at the time had no place to come home to a shelter was the only option i did n't want my kids to be split up she said i had to put away my pride so we could all stay together as she sat in the living room of her current home a modest green and white three bedroom ms garrett shared the painful memories of shelter life there were the three nights spent sleeping in chairs the almost daily police presence the cramped studio unit with five beds the insufficient cooking space the disciplinary problems her youngest son antonio just 6 when the family went to the shelter had in five different schools i do n't want to remember she said i was always depressed and i think my kids felt sorry for me sophia who will complete high school in january remembers trying to hide her shelter life from friends and as the oldest having to maintain order among her siblings in her mother 's absence she was the mother when i was at work recalled ms garrett who had a full time security job at macy 's during the shelter days and there was another mother across the hall who helped out in the fall of 2000 the garretts found government subsidized housing with a monthly rent of 1300 but there was still that idea of becoming a funeral director in august 2002 she enrolled in school after months of juggling full time work and her studies ms garrett realized that she was spending too much time away from her children so she left her job to concentrate on her family and her classes with grants loans and some public assistance she was able to support her children and to be at home when they returned from school still in september of this year ms garrett had trouble paying her rent

 it wo n't be easy but baseball has to find a way to crack down on steroids which more and more big leaguers appear to be using every year and which could threaten to turn the game into a freak show mark mcgwire has used steroids this is now clear to any person who looks at the facts about androstenedione the testosterone booster mcgwire was taking two seasons ago when he broke roger maris 's single season home run record it 's a steroid that 's what most scientists say and what the government will most likely say sometime soon gen barry r mccaffrey the white house 's drug policy director used a speech to the citizenship through sports alliance at the end of june to say he thinks androstenedione will be classified by the government as a steroid within a few months the international olympic committee already classifies andro as an anabolic steroid its medical director patrick schamasch told me in a phone interview last month that major league baseball should have banned andro long ago but andro is only the beginning of the story the drug was first isolated by european scientists in the 1930 's but it was developed in the 1980 's by the east german sports machine it was used as a so called bridging drug to tide east german athletes over when they had to stop taking other steroids before testing at competitions andro and other steroids went together then and in all likelihood they go together now if steroids once seemed like the recourse of a few power hitters those days are long gone pitchers add around four to six miles an hour on their fastballs infielders once known only for their gloves bulk up enough to inflate their home run totals and of course the big men get bigger that 's why we are very likely to see more incidents like the recent discovery of vials of steroids and syringes in a car belonging to boston infielder manny alexander though he was n't driving it at the time the police discovered the illegal goods baseball is investigating whether the steroids belonged to alexander baseball will most likely ban androstenedione in the near future once a harvard team of researchers completes a fresh study into whether andro can boost athletic performance not just muscle mass some observers have been critical of baseball 's reluctance to take action on andro just after mcgwire 's record setting season but this is an unfair criticism that would have been terrible public relations and no major sport can afford that baseball badly needed the boost it got from mcgwire 's and sammy sosa 's home run show it was clear at the time that baseball would need to wait until a tasteful interval passed before it could take on andro this is the time to act and not just regarding andro but all steroids the players union strenuously opposes testing for steroids so immediate action is not possible but if baseball 's leadership makes a public case between now and the end of next season when a new collective bargaining agreement will be negotiated the players will risk widespread fan outrage if they resist the call for testing the explosion in home runs has become so pronounced baseball officials went to the trouble to have the ball inspected to show that it is n't more lively now than it used to be but even if the ball is n't juiced many players appear to be the fans know that the modern mania of power power power has robbed the summer game of much of the nuance and subtlety that roger angell and roger kahn and so many others have memorably celebrated that 's not to say that chemicals improve hand eye coordination or make connecting with a fastball any easier they ca n't do that hitting a baseball is still the hardest thing in sports but added strength can change what happens once a ball is struck sportswriters talk among themselves constantly about such signs of steroid use as bizarre mood swings and large patches of acne in strange places like the shoulders sometimes so noticeable that players wear dark t shirts under their uniforms sometimes sportswriters even talk with players about steroids usually with those who are n't using them and who resent those who do for the advantage they gain but little is written i covered the oakland athletics for the san francisco chronicle between 1994 and 1998 and wrote countless articles about mcgwire 's plantar fascia the connective tissue at the bottom of his feet but i never wrote any stories raising questions about steroids nor did the five other beat writers covering the team in those years sportswriters in short are part of the problem they have a tough job and anyone who has covered a pro team week in and week out through a long season knows that good judgment dictates not needlessly alienating players you need to do your stories that means it is unlikely that many beat writers will report on steroid use even though more and more baseball old timers are horrified at what 's happening to the game not only have the game 's fundamental skills been sacrificed for power but baseball 's oldest records also risk becoming devalued some hall of famers believe it ca n't come from me because it sounds like sour grapes but yes it 's disturbing one player in the hall of fame recently told the arizona republic columnist pedro gomez it taints all of us who got here because we earned it the right way it taints what hank aaron and willie mays and every one of us did to reach 500 home runs why do you think some of these guys are constantly hurt their muscles are too big for their ligaments and tendons it 's obvious who is on the stuff you do n't need to be a scientist or specialist to know just look at these guys what 's striking about steroid use in baseball and in other popular arenas is not just how widespread it seems to have become but how much public acceptance it seems to have gained professional wrestling in which bodies puffed up absurdly by steroids are both mocked and celebrated has gained an ever higher profile in recent years almost egging on baseball players many of whom love to watch professional wrestling even in the clubhouse steroids do not just pump up athletes bodies into grotesque shapes sacrificing suppleness to gain more raw power they are also dangerous liver failure heart trouble and cancer all lurk as potential consequences of heavy sustained steroid use players calculate that it 's worth the risk to pump up their numbers along with their bodies and make more money while they can but it 's doubtful many of them are fully aware of the risks they are taking unlike the national football league which has had limited success in reducing steroid use major league baseball does not test for steroids this policy may well have made sense back when steroid use was an anomaly now that bulking up with chemical help seems to be more popular than ever it 's incumbent on baseball to take action baseball has enough problems it can not afford to be passive on steroids and wait until the problem gets so out of hand that a player in a 'roid rage does something awful and the dark secret finally becomes a full fledged national controversy backtalk steve kettmann covered the last two world series for salon and wrote on the recent east german doping trial in berlin for the new republic

 sammy sosa fell to the ground and the chicago cubs went with him sunday a fastball from the florida marlins josh beckett tailed toward sosa 's head in the fourth inning of game 4 of the national league championship series sending him sprawling to the dirt and popping up furiously as marlins catcher ivan rodriguez and the home plate umpire began to cool down sosa beckett approached them and took the ball from rodriguez as if he had just plopped down quarters for a newspaper beckett went back to the mound and continued shutting down sosa and the cubs his fastball climbed to 100 miles an hour in that at bat and he finally fooled sosa with a full count changeup to strike him out beckett finished with a two hit shutout tying an nlcs record for a 4 0 victory the cubs lead in the four of seven game series shrank to 3 2 as beckett sent them back to wrigley field in search of their first pennant in 58 years i 'm just used to having the ball in my hand beckett said that 's what i felt like i needed to do i did n't feel like i backed down at all i thought he overreacted to be completely honest with you i thought it was really stupid that we had to go through that sosa did not accuse beckett of throwing intentionally at him but he did blame the events of the previous inning and his own history for his reaction sosa was hit on the helmet twice this season including one scary incident on april 20 when the pittsburgh pirates salomon torres broke his helmet with a pitch that hit sosa 's left ear flap in the third inning sunday the cubs starter carlos zambrano hit the marlins miguel cabrera on the elbow with a pitch because of what happened before maybe that was my reaction sosa said i have nothing against nobody i like to play the game the way it is but when i do n't like something i 'm going to let him know the cubs still maintain the upper hand with mark prior pitching game 6 on tuesday against the marlins carl pavano and if that fails to produce joy in wrigleyville the cubs kerry wood starting game 7 chicago is 5 0 in wood 's and prior 's starts this postseason but the marlins have the cubs history on their side the cubs have not been to the world series since 1945 losing three straight games to the san diego padres in 1984 the last time they were within one victory of getting there not only will the marlins have to get past prior and wood but they will also most likely have to do it without beckett mike lowell ivan rodriguez and jeff conine homered sunday lowell 's two run shot in the fifth breaking a scoreless tie and finally tiring zambrano who was expending physical and emotional energy rapidly zambrano finished each of the first four innings with fist pumps as he walked off the mound beckett who struck out 11 batters allowed only three base runners two singles and a walk none of whom reached second base he took over the game in the fourth sosa who had grounded out in his first at bat dug in against beckett whose first pitch sailed at sosa 's head sosa fell to the ground and as he struggled to his feet he yelled at beckett and gestured with his bat cubs in the dugout leaned on the top step ready in case there was an altercation like the one in the yankees red sox game on saturday but the plate umpire larry poncino quickly stepped in speaking face to face with sosa as rodriguez the marlins catcher tried cooling him down sosa was focused squarely on poncino then and beckett walked in and retrieved the baseball from rodriguez i do n't know what he was trying to do trying to pull a boston red sox yankees thing beckett said i was so surprised i had to shoot something else back at him it was kind of baffling to me really rodriguez said he remembered sosa 's beaning in april and understood his reaction i know he had an accident rodriguez said but in this situation i 'm not trying to hit him it was just a pitch that slipped sosa said he told rodriguez you have to understand i 've been hit pretty good in the head a couple of times and i do n't like that anymore that 's got to stop sosa took a 3 2 changeup that he thought was high and stepped toward first base before poncino called it strike three marlins fans among the crowd of 65279 having overtaken pro player stadium from the noisy cubs fans trailed a muttering sosa to the dugout with howls beckett 23 dominated the san francisco giants in the marlins first postseason game but was outdone by jason schmidt 's three hit shutout beckett pitched poorly in his next game succumbing to the wind at wrigley field in game 1 in what became a wild opener to this series but beckett may be the most talented of the marlins young starters and sunday he dazzled the cubs with fastballs a tightly spun breaking ball that froze hitters and a changeup that seemed to change speeds at will marlins manager jack mckeon had no relievers throwing because i could n't have anybody in the bullpen that had better stuff than he had in the ninth inning sosa was the cubs final batter taking a fastball clocked at 97 mph swinging through another at 95 mph and finally grounding out to short on a changeup to finish 0 for 4 i could n't think of another guy that could have messed that game up more than sammy sosa if he hit a home run there said beckett who swung his arm like a hammer after the final out it was a sigh of relief

 in his four seasons with the giants running back sean bennett has had three uniform numbers and an equal number of serious knee injuries and that is not counting a hamstring strain that took a year to heal he has been on the physically unable to perform list and on injured reserve he has been cut by the giants and virtually ignored by the rest of the national football league once a training camp phenomenon who became a rookie starter in the giants opening game in 1999 bennett did not play a down in the next two seasons without an nfl team a year ago the 26 year old bennett spent the season working out alone he dabbled in drawing he was an art major at northwestern and chauffeured his wife shelley a part time actress to auditions in new york city on sundays he had pizza delivered to their new jersey apartment a few miles from giants stadium and watched the giants on television although the giants cut him sept 2 2001 the team offered to provide him with game tickets but as bennett said today i would have had to pay for them the pizza was cheaper not surprisingly sunday afternoons were the hardest times last year for bennett a fourth round draft pick once considered a future star but now bennett is back in a giants uniform wearing no 20 after wearing no 44 as a rookie and no 28 in his second and third preseasons he has not missed a practice and with tiki barber the starting running back injured he has even been a workhorse in the backfield in saturday 's preseason victory over the new england patriots the giants dedicated almost an entire drive to bennett in the third quarter bennett touched the ball on 9 of 10 plays as the giants moved from their 18 yard line to the patriots 23 he rushed 6 times for 22 yards and caught 3 passes for 33 yards bennett ended the drive with a fumble on the 10th play but for a player who endured a 31 month football layoff it was a coming out party moreover bennett came out of the game healthy he finished with 32 rushing yards on 8 carries and a team high 6 receptions for 56 yards well aware of bennett 's history of injuries the giants have been low key about his potential role in the offense this season after all barber is the star of the backfield and more passes than ever will be going to the tight end the rookie jeremy shockey but after a few weeks of training camp practices and two preseason games it is also apparent that bennett is prominent in the giants plans he is on first string special teams and could be paired with barber for a quick dangerous backfield at 6 feet 1 inch and 230 pounds and blessed with great speed and soft hands bennett has always dazzled the giants coaches with his potential it is what made the offensive coordinator sean payton design whole sections of the team playbook with bennett in mind heading into the 2000 season that was before the injuries mounted he missed all of that season with a knee injury and came into the preseason last year with a hamstring injury that seemingly would not heal the giants finally threw up their hands and cut bennett when he was released bennett went back to his new jersey apartment and stayed busy while waiting for his injury to heal raised in evansville ind bennett decided it was time to learn about new york city he made trips into manhattan three or four times a week driving his wife to auditions and seeing as many broadway plays as he could i could probably drive a cab in there now bennett said bennett also stayed in touch with the giants he did drawings for the families of two giants coaches the defensive coordinator johnnie lynn and the linebackers coach tom olivadotti i would draw their wives and children bennett said i 've done that before in college that 's how i paid for my wife 's engagement ring when bennett 's legs felt strong enough to resume running he made one major change in his off season training regimen he cut it in half last year the giants were aghast to find out that bennett after doing his usual two hour workout at giants stadium frequently drove directly to a local high school and worked out for another two or three hours he was wearing himself out giants coach jim fassel said maybe cutting him back will not be the answer to better health but man it ca n't hurt for now bennett has been something he has never been in a giants training camp largely unnoticed and healthy with another new number these days at practice he could be any unheralded free agent after my rookie year when i hurt my knee twice i switched from no 44 because i thought it brought me bad luck bennett said but then no 28 was even worse so far i feel pretty good with no 20 i 'm thinking it might be a keeper extra points darnell dinkins the fourth string quarterback who became an overnight star with a thunderous hit covering a giants punt in saturday night 's preseason game began working out monday with the tight ends giants coach jim fassel said he wanted to try to find a spot on the team for dinkins especially to keep him available for special teams center dusty zeigler whose recovery from off season knee surgery has been enveloped by uncertainty was in colorado on monday for a second opinion from a knee specialist the giants have set no target date for when zeigler might be available to play fassel indicated that the rookie receiver tim carter who bruised his back in practice aug 1 would probably not practice this week that means he will not play in the next preseason game saturday in atlanta running back tiki barber participated in about 15 practice plays monday the most since he strained a rib cage muscle last week

 for the second time in five months the state 's highest court today said the giuliani administration was overzealous in enforcing a zoning law that restricted sex related businesses this time batting down a city attempt to close a topless bar in chelsea the court of appeals found unanimously that the vip club at 20 west 20th street had successfully skirted the rules on x rated businesses by turning most of its space into a restaurant and bar limiting the area where it had topless dancers today 's opinion mirrors a case decided in december when the court of appeals ruled against the city 's bid to shut down a pornographic video and book store on the upper west side today 's decision was the first to explore how the new zoning law applied to topless dancing simon h rothkrug the lawyer for the vip club said the ruling applied to 25 to 50 clubs citywide that used the same strategy to get around the law he said that tonight the club 's dancers would take off the latex body suits and bikinis they have had to wear since the city first tried to close the club in november it 's another victory for first amendment freedom of expression rights mr rothkrug said and hopefully it will put an end to the city 's heavy handed efforts to punish the vip club steven m fishner mayor rudolph w giuliani 's criminal justice coordinator released a statement accusing the court of making it possible for some businesses to evade the law 's clear purpose the city will continue vigorous enforcement he said and would consider changes in the law to circumvent the rulings to ensure that our residences schools and places of worship remain far from the shadows cast by strip clubs and other sex related businesses mr giuliani fought for the 1995 zoning law hoping to reduce the number of pornographic businesses and push them into industrial areas according to officials the city has shuttered more than 60 of the 145 sex related businesses in new york since 1998 when the city began enforcing the law after it was upheld by the united states supreme court but that campaign hit a snag because the law said it applied only to stores and clubs where a substantial portion of the space was devoted to x rated commerce the idea was to exempt an ordinary video or book store that might have a shelf or two of sexually graphic material the city adopted a rule that defined a substantial portion as 40 percent or more of a store 's shelves floor space or inventory pornographic video stores then filled 60 percent of their space with kung fu tapes and hollywood flops while places like the vip club restricted nude or topless dancers to 40 percent or less of their floor space the city called that sham compliance and tried to close them but in december the court of appeals found that the rule must be taken literally and that the city did not have the right to say that technical compliance was not good enough the city responded early this year by altering that rule to say that no more than 40 percent of a store 's revenues could come from x rated material a rule that store owners have promised to challenge in court today 's decision also turned on the 60 40 rule the vip club 's owner dezer entertainment concepts redesigned the club so that topless dancers were only on the mezzanine level which encompassed 36 percent of floor space the mezzanine mr rothkrug said was above and invisible from the main floor which was turned into a bar and restaurant new york state 's liquor law prohibits completely nude entertainers in a business where alcohol is served once again the city relied on the sham compliance argument and argued that the 60 40 rule did not apply to topless clubs today the court of appeals in a short unsigned decision said the 60 40 rule did apply and that the appellate division had no business taking up the question of whether this was sham compliance the court pointed to its december decision that the rule must be applied literally mr rothkrug accused the city of singling out the vip club for enforcement while the case went through the courts putting it at a competitive disadvantage we 've been padlocked on a couple of occasions he said we are the only club that has not been allowed to be topless on a 60 40 basis for the last six months pending the appeals

 call it collusion call it a market correction juan acevedo has his private suspicions whatever it was that chilled the free agent market this winter he got caught in the middle of it you can say i 've got a chip on my shoulder said acevedo a seven year major league veteran who is in the yankees camp on a minor league deal you can say there 's more fuel to the fire acevedo 32 saved 28 of the detroit tigers 55 victories last season he has worked in 85 games since august 2001 with a 262 earned run average and almost nobody wanted him it was very surprising very upsetting said acevedo a former mets right hander i 'm looking forward to showing some people that they made bad decisions i look at it a couple of ways either they 're going to like me or they 're not going to like me teams that said they liked me did n't have money either they were just trying to save money or not telling the truth the tigers closer 's job belongs to matt anderson who was hurt last season if acevedo had returned to detroit he would have been a setup man we tried to re sign him at the end of the year but he wanted closer money said dave dombrowski the tigers general manager that 's understandable acevedo said he was not looking for 5 million or 6 million a year but he expected to get a two year deal somewhere maybe for 4 million or 5 million total there were encouraging signs jay witasick signed a two year contract with san diego so did brian boehringer with pittsburgh neither of those pitchers saved more than one game let alone half his team 's victories at least acevedo said i did n't make any big purchases this winter acevedo said he had one major league offer but refused it because the team misled him he sorted through six or seven minor league deals and picked the yankees who will pay him 950000 if he plays for them but there are no guarantees we did it without promises general manager brian cashman said we told him 'you know this is the situation trades would have to take place or injuries if everything works out great if you 're willing to come in under those circumstances come on in so acevedo is competing for a spot manager joe torre will have 11 pitchers on the roster and six starters will make it so will the left hander chris hammond and the right handers mariano rivera steve karsay and most likely antonio osuna the left hander randy choate will probably get the last spot the quality of his stuff is way up there and we really like that as well as his experience torre said of acevedo but it comes down to numbers he 'll be around for a while and we 'll see the yankees jeff weaver played with acevedo last season and told acevedo that he was surprised to see him here for him to not get a big league deal it blew my mind weaver said especially when everybody seems to be looking for pitching most teams are now evaluating their own candidates for pitching jobs but as the spring progresses trade talks could pick up san diego for one may seek a closer to replace trevor hoffman who is having shoulder surgery this week and will miss much of the season acevedo can be released at the end of camp if it is clear he will not make the team if he does make the yankees weaver said they will have a solid pitcher his cutter 's phenomenal weaver said he 's got real live stuff the closer 's job was thrown at him and he came in and did a great job when he was on it was pretty much three up three down no questions asked the only question for acevedo is what happened this winter i 'm a guy that works hard plays hurt i 've never had any excuses he said i do n't know you tell me

 don shula one of the most successful coaches in national football league history struggled to establish a running game in his final seasons with the miami dolphins jimmy johnson a two time super bowl winner as coach of the dallas cowboys left the dolphins after four seasons frustrated by the same problem two distinguished coaches still no reliable running game just when it appeared that the dolphins might remain a running backs wasteland well into the 21st century only one 1000 yard rusher since 1978 along came a guy named smith with an uninspiring resume that includes jail time injuries and seven years of missed opportunities this too was a football vagabond with only 15 career nfl starts who turned 30 during the season yet lamar smith is now regarded as a blend of delvin williams and larry csonka two 1000 yard dolphins runners from yesteryear in rushing for 1139 yards this season smith showed the shiftiness of williams and some of csonka 's tackle breaking ability then came the real stunner 209 yards rushing in 40 carries last saturday in miami 's 23 17 overtime victory over indianapolis in the wild card playoff round that rushing total was second only to eric dickerson 's 248 yards in 1986 in the nfl playoffs and vaulted the dolphins into a divisional round game at oakland on saturday the raiders who have had their troubles against the run this season already are talking as if they plan to gang up against the run on saturday and make quarterback jay fiedler who is playing with a torn left rotator cuff beat them i know they 're going to commit a lot of people up there fiedler said today but they 've still got to tackle him oronde gadsden said as a receiver your biggest fear with a running back is him running up your legs while you 're blocking he has n't done that because he 's pacing waiting for us to get in position where we can seal the man and then he makes his cut tight end jed weaver credits smith 's work habits for the runner 's emergence in his seventh season when lamar gets a run in practice no matter what carry it is you 've got to wait for him to come back to the huddle because he ran 30 yards down the field weaver said it 's that discipline to push himself i see him in the weight room and i see him in the ice tub he 's always getting his body healthy so when he hits that hole he can explode study of videotape by the dolphins has shown that smith has gotten about 30 percent of his yardage after the opponent 's initial hit when he 's getting contact his shoulders are going north south said dolphins running backs coach joel collier that usually gets you yards after contact smith joined the dolphins in march almost as an afterthought once their first choice richard huntley opted to re sign with pittsburgh i did n't think he was the answer linebacker zach thomas said i got surprised big time smith has had a lot to overcome he suffered a broken ankle in 1997 a broken leg in '98 he was dumped by seattle and new orleans he also has served 60 days in jail after pleading guilty to vehicular assault in a 1994 wreck in which a backseat occupant in smith 's vehicle mike frier was paralyzed from the waist down as part of a 1997 settlement frier then a seattle defensive end was to receive up to 50 percent of smith 's wages over a seven year period smith who wo n't talk about the accident has been unavailable for comment because he has been getting extra treatment every day after the pounding he took against indianapolis history suggests that it will be difficult for him to duplicate his production this week against oakland of the four runners before smith to have at least 36 carries in a playoff game only one washington 's john riggins had a productive encore riggins kept churning all the way to the super bowl xvii championship among the three who lapsed the jets curtis martin in 1998 went from 124 yards in 36 carries against jacksonville to 14 yards in 13 carries in a loss to denver still with fiedler ailing chances are that the dolphins will depend on smith again on saturday mark dixon the guard said we 're going to keep riding lamar as long as we have to

 with the development of life prolonging aids drugs in recent years the high cost of treatment has become a source of legitimate complaint in developing nations in the poorest regions of the world where aids has hit hardest effective treatment is all but unaffordable so there is reason to welcome last week 's announcement that five of the world 's largest pharmaceutical companies have offered to slash the price of aids drugs in poor countries in an agreement with the united nations the companies pledged to sell their drugs for as much as 90 percent below the prices americans pay by the end of 1999 more than 33 million people worldwide were living with hiv the virus that causes aids ninety five percent of them were in the developing world including 23 million in sub saharan africa yet in most of these countries treatment of the disease is negligible cheaper drugs by themselves will likely have little immediate impact there are still far too few doctors and nurses in these regions and health care facilities are hopelessly inadequate the powerful drug cocktails that can prolong life cost as much as 15000 a year for a single american patient even reducing prices by 90 percent would leave the drugs unaffordable for most africans but drastically cut prices can encourage doctors and health care officials in poor countries to learn how to use these drugs and to develop the clinics needed to deliver them and monitor their use lower prices also may serve as an incentive for people to get tested for the virus and to seek care the un estimates that 90 percent of those living with hiv are unaware of their infection the drug companies announcement came a day after the clinton administration issued a long overdue executive order saying the united states would not interfere with african countries that violate american patent law to provide aids drugs more cheaply either by licensing local companies to produce generic versions or by importing lower cost drugs resources and political will in many afflicted nations are still inadequate to the urgent needs of prevention education and health care development but the price decision by the drug companies is cause for hope
 there was just under four minutes left when a cruel punctuation to patrick ewing 's return to the knicks was about to unfold with his aching joints creaking like old floorboards with his bones as heavy as lead pipes ewing lumbered out too slow and too late to reach sam perkins as he settled in to the left corner of the floor the pacers braided old timer had enough light to line up a 3 pointer that took the air out of the knicks plans to right their miserable second quarter collapse with a late comeback as perkins 's 3 pointer was swallowed by the net the pacers 6 point lead grew to 9 and the knicks resilience finally snapped the pacers went on to win game 5 of the eastern conference finals 88 79 tonight at conseco fieldhouse they also pushed the knicks to the brink of elimination by taking a lead of three games to two in this four of seven game series game 6 will be played on friday night at madison square garden tonight the knicks performance only fed the illusion that they are a better team without ewing at first glance it will look as if latrell sprewell 4 for 14 and larry johnson 2 for 8 the heroes of games 3 and 4 without ewing were stifled by their center 's presence it will look as if the perimeter bound allan houston 25 points was the only one who could function with ewing on the floor everyone will say we 're 5 1 without ewing said sprewell citing the knicks record against the pacers over the last two years when ewing has been injured that 's not a fair thing to say about patrick we hate to see it it is what it is but the bottom line he 'll probably be playing in the next game and we have to get a win with him on the floor the knicks started off in the right direction it was ewing 's dream return at first he made his first three shots and sent the knicks off to an 18 point lead early in the second period only to watch the team unravel during the rest of the nightmarish quarter the knicks scored just 8 points went 1 for 15 during the last 10 minutes and 42 seconds of the quarter and trailed by 42 40 after the pacers 23 3 run it was a horrendous stretch filled with lost loose balls and a lack of composure they made their run said ewing who finished 5 for 10 from the field with 13 points and 7 rebounds during 29 minutes of playing time we did n't regroup you have to stay positive you have to keep on believing could it be that the many knicks injuries sprewell 's foot johnson 's back ewing 's foot are just too much for one team to overcome ask me that after the season ewing said ask me that after we win the championship ewing maintained his stubborn faith even after a second quarter that rattled the knicks and left them irreparably damaged if only for a night instead of containing the pacers chris childs and charlie ward let travis best 24 points beat them off the dribble and mark jackson 11 points 7 assists bludgeon them in the post instead of closing off reggie miller 16 points houston gave him open looks and let him slip by him on the baseline instead of blocking out their man the ewing anchored knicks were outrebounded 45 43 we were outworked out hustled sprewell said we did n't have that extra something indiana did in that fateful second quarter the pacers effort showed on the boards with marcus camby 0 for 3 4 rebounds getting beaten to the boards by players like austin croshere best and derrick mckey the knicks were outrebounded in the second quarter 16 8 on one play best hit a 3 pointer on a third chance after two misses by miller the 3 point opportunities haunted the knicks they gave up 4 for 9 from 3 point range in the second quarter we played an outstanding 12 to 14 minutes van gundy said after that we did n't play like we 're capable of playing you can characterize it by saying it was a little of good defense by them and some bad offense by us being up 18 and then losing that lead you are still only behind by 2 points at the half but the damage had been done to the knicks psyche they never recovered the lead from there only houston was able to make any dents in the pacers ever increasing lead almost each time houston came up with a jumper there would be a breakdown on the other end we did n't keep our intensity up sprewell said we just started going away from all the things that worked early for almost a week ewing watched his team win two playoff games without him while listening to his critics argue how the knicks were better when he was seated on the bench that was enough motivation for ewing tonight but if he needed one more incentive to push him through the pain during game 5 he received it from jeff van gundy this morning a blissfully unaware rik smits ambled into a hallway today only to find that an indignant van gundy had turned his honest replies about playing against ewing into a gauntlet for the knicks aging and injured center on tuesday smits said he preferred to play against ewing because he felt the 37 year old center was easier to score on ewing played him from behind while chris dudley and kurt thomas fronted him and denied him the ball if i was rik smits personally i would not have said that van gundy said before his team 's shoot around at conseco fieldhouse i 've never heard anybody ask to play against patrick this is a first for me not many guys ask to play against a hall of famer at his position i do n't know how patrick will respond i know one thing he 's not usually motivated by external forces but i 've never seen someone basically call him out ewing responded by humiliating smits in the opening quarter and leading the knicks to a 32 17 first quarter lead then the pacers with smits on the bench and travis best guiding their way responded by embarrassing the knicks right back in one surreal second quarter the pacers unleashed a frenzied rebounding effort pressured the knicks into a four turnovers and made up an 18 point deficit with an overpowering 23 3 run the pacers grabbed an amazing 42 40 halftime lead the knicks stayed in the game but came up short it did n't matter if patrick was in or out of the game ward said he was there when we got a big lead it 's only one game they 're up 3 2 we ca n't let this zap our intensity or our emotions rebounds the knicks 8 points in the second quarter set a franchise record for fewest points in a quarter on april 19 1983 they scored 9 points in the third quarter against philadelphia another ailment was added to the knicks mounting injury list at the end of game 4 larry johnson felt discomfort in his right foot and took himself out with 41 seconds left on wednesday the injury was diagnosed as plantar fasciitis

 to the sports editor for those yankee fans who are still trying to understand why they hate us consider how most baseball fans throughout the country feel about the yankees they passionately resent them the yankees have spend and make considerably more money than any other team in baseball when they have a need they do n't simply fill it they are able to fill it with the best player available in the game giambi mussina clemens and they win consistently what can be particularly galling is that many of their fans do n't have the decency to acknowledge that the deck is so very lopsidedly stacked in their favor to the contrary their fans who do nothing but cheer seem to feel entitled to each and every yankee victory meanwhile most other teams struggle mightily simply to field a competitive team and their fans seethe about how unfair is the yankees dominance ed rankin seattle
 he has been notably absent from major track and field competitions for more than a year and he was notably absent from tonight 's premeet parade of stars during which the likes of maurice greene and gail devers took a lap on the track at the louis ii stadium in classic convertible cars but javier sotomayor a former and perhaps future olympic champion finally did make an appearance pulling on his spikes and his wraparound sunglasses in the humid evening air of the cote d'azur and smiling through the mixture of boos whistles and cheers that greeted the announcement of his name in tonight 's lineup of high jumpers two hours later sotomayor heard more mixed reviews from the crowd as he stood on the podium after winning his event at the golden league meet in monaco by clearing 230 meters 7 feet 6 inches sotomayor and cuban track officials may have been able to persuade the international amateur athletic federation to reduce his suspension for testing positive for cocaine from two years to one year but from the sound of it tonight some track fans still need to be convinced that sotomayor who won the gold medal in the 1992 olympics should be allowed back among the pack of olympic hopefuls who are clearing bars at big money one night meets in hopes of reaching their peaks next month in sydney australia i think javier has a really good chance of winning another gold said alberto juantorena the president of the cuban track and field federation who successfully pleaded sotomayor 's case here in front of the iaaf council on aug 2 i was not fantastic today sotomayor told french television i was very tired because i have been practicing a lot and i also have a new baby since july which is another reason why i 'm a little tired but i should be able to clear 236 or 237 at the olympics i just hope nobody else does 240 sotomayor who set the world record of 245 meters 8 feet in 1993 tested positive for cocaine during last year 's pan american games and was stripped of the gold medal he had already won sotomayor denied ever using cocaine and was cleared by the cuban federation which maintained that the second of his two urine samples might have been tampered with after months of legal wrangling and hearings an iaaf arbitration panel upheld the two year ban on june 27 which meant that sotomayor was ineligible to compete until july 30 2001 but the cuban federation pursued his case under a clause in the iaaf rulebook that allows drug bans to be modified under exceptional circumstances the iaaf citing the hundreds of drug tests the 32 year old had passed during his career cut sotomayor 's penalty in half on aug 2 sotomayor returned to competition on tuesday in a minor meet in montauban france and won with a leap of 228 meters the minimum established by the cuban federation for olympic selection but tonight was his return to his sport 's first division and his victims included charles austin the reigning olympic champion and nathan leeper both of the united states other americans fared better greene won the men 's 100 meters over a relatively weak field in the unspectacular time of 1001 seconds inger miller won the women 's 100 in 1091 her best time of the season and later helped the women 's 4x100 relay team warm up for sydney by beating teams from the bahamas and france in a season best time of 4213 seconds devers also part of the relay tonight remained undefeated in the 100 hurdles this season winning in 1254 seconds after what she called a technically poor performance the most impressive run of the night came from ali saidi sief the emerging algerian middle distance star who set a national record and meet record by wining the men 's 3000 in 7 minutes 2502 seconds cathy freeman the australian who will be a focus of attention in sydney also ran the season 's fastest women 's 400 winning in 4948 seconds and irina privalova a former european champion in the 200 who has switched to the 400 hurdles surprised the american champion sandra glover cummings to win in 5406 seconds

 the scene was replayed throughout spring training each time the veterans joe mcewing and jay bell would speak to reporters in the mets clubhouse the rookie ty wigginton whose locker was positioned between theirs would sit with his eyes focused on each question and his teammates answers i guess i like to learn wigginton said later mcewing noticed and as camp went on and wigginton established himself as the mets third baseman he asked more and more questions every time he did he would talk to me about it and see if he was right mcewing said he did n't want to make anybody feel uncomfortable he was seeing if he was doing all right nearly five months into his rookie season wigginton 25 has become one of the few players the mets can depend on when they traded roberto alomar to the chicago white sox on july 1 wigginton became a candidate to shift to second base next season but manager art howe and jim duquette the interim general manager both said wigginton would remain at third base where he started his 123rd game on friday wigginton has provided stability even though he received the third base job almost by default the mets thought they had an agreement with the japanese free agent norihiro nakamura last december but he changed his mind at the last minute after a winter without a third baseman they signed bell days before spring training to compete with wigginton for the starting job before the season started he was option no 3 or 4 duquette said friday by telephone it 's hard to believe with the way he 's played he was n't option no 1 duquette said wigginton 's defensive development was the biggest surprise the mets sent wigginton to the dominican republic to play winter ball in the off season there he started beside shortstop jose reyes who offered rave reviews of wigginton now duquette likes wigginton 's play on balls hit to his right that 's a change from what the mets expected the mets left wigginton exposed to other teams in the rule v draft in 1999 and every team passed on him he hit 21 home runs that season for class a st lucie and 20 the next for class aa binghamton and began building a reputation as a power hitting infielder but wigginton had only eight homers and just one in his previous 167 at bats before hitting home runs on thursday and friday on thursday he hit a 413 foot drive over the center field wall at qualcomm stadium in san diego with his parents in the stands his home run on friday came against the dodgers hideo nomo for the mets only run in a 2 1 loss entering tonight 's game wigginton 's 29 doubles led the mets and national league rookies and are a team record for a rookie he also led the mets in runs scored with 63 and was second to cliff floyd with 64 runs batted in he 's got juice howe said there 's no doubt in my mind he should become a 15 to 20 home run guy on a regular basis wigginton said i could see even more than that i could see next year hitting 20 plus he has adjusted as pitchers threw him breaking balls away then jammed him inside they now alternate between the two he continues to make adjustments at the plate duquette said eventually he 's going to drive the ball with power when duquette met with him a few weeks ago wigginton reported that the physical grind of the big leagues had not been as great as the mental one the more frequent days off and more comfortable travel compensate for the longer schedule but the mental adjustments are tougher duquette is impressed that wigginton makes the distinction with wigginton 's development and the mets plans to keep him at third they can focus on second base the last two years have led the mets to conclude that they have become too old with too much turnover at too many key positions so they hope to build a young core wigginton is a start as is reyes and possibly the first baseman catcher jason phillips the mets plan to strengthen themselves up the middle focusing on second base and center field but next year 's budget will most likely allow for filling only one position through free agency the other will come from within with jeff duncan a candidate at center and the minor leaguers danny garcia and victor diaz at second

 no offense has been more productive or more pulverizing than the st louis rams over the last three seasons but in their past two games the loss to new england in the super bowl and sunday 's slip up against denver the rams scored 17 and 16 points there is hand wringing and head scratching over the offense from rams management coaches and players there is a notion that defenses especially the nfl 's superior ones have a formula to finally shackle this band of speed bandits there is a concern that since defenses have a history and a knack of eventually suppressing hybrid offenses this is what is happening the rams scoring machine as we have come to know it is being negated this is the current popular method to choke the rams hit them hard and hit them harder turnovers will ensue and their receivers become gun shy put pressure on quarterback kurt warner with four linemen and little blitzing play plenty of two deep coverage and prevent big plays tackle well tampa bay got the scheme started even though it lost the 1999 national football conference championship game to the rams 11 6 new orleans over the last couple of seasons has found success with the formula the giants continued the theme in a 15 14 loss to the rams last season then new england perfected it in the super bowl denver 's defense followed suit it did it so well that the rams managed only one touchdown in the 23 16 loss at denver and that came on a 3 yard third quarter run by marshall faulk not with their imposing passing game the giants visit st louis on sunday and their defense has high hopes that it can continue the trend to punish the rams offense into submission we are now starting to hear about the rams what was said a decade ago about the great san francisco offense when it finally began to slide offensively the rams rely too much on timing and not enough on power they do more prancing than they are physical the insulting two words finesse team is enveloping the rams again the rams play with more finesse and we had our minds made up that we were going to play very physical denver defensive end trevor pryce said how physical we took a lot of super bowl film and saw new england really popping guys in the mouth and we saw they did n't like that denver linebacker john mobley said that was something that we wanted to do hit them when they were n't looking and even when they were looking lay something on them that 's what we did and it showed they did n't want to catch the ball late in the game defensive end keith washington said our guys were flying all around making big hits today i think we may have shocked them with how we kept fighting and pressuring warner even rams tight end ernie conwell conceded they did a great job of hitting us in the mouth rams coach mike martz after denver jumped to a 10 0 lead and a 16 6 first half edge said they took the fight to us and shook us up a bit imagine that the rams preening offense all shook up actually the rams were defiant after the loss some of them privately said that they believe they are a much better team than denver that they simply made occasional critical mistakes that cost them the game and that their offensive line did not play well but can and will play much better the two glaring problems for the rams offense were its lack of a running game only a yard rushing in the first half and 32 for the game and martz 's penchant for the big play instead of the steady one with his team trailing denver 16 13 and with the ball at the denver 9 martz chose to go for a first down on a fourth and 1 pass instead of attempting to kick a field goal to tie the game the play failed martz defended the call by saying we 're aggressive and we 'll always be aggressive you make a deal like that and you energize your football team the problem was the rams were already energized in the second half and tying the score would have energized them more in the big picture aggressiveness is good in that situation it was a horrible call because the gap between the rams offense and the league 's better defenses is closing now the giants defense and their new coordinator johnnie lynn are intent on closing that gap even tighter we know we 're a better team than we showed and we want to get back to balance in our offense warner said we have a lot of pride on offense and we want to get back on top of our game the rams are counting on that but the good defenses in the league see a crack worth exploiting

 his team is on the cusp of taking its first trip to the national basketball association finals and reggie miller is concerned this is the same team that was down 15 or 16 points against miami in game 6 at halftime and found a way to win that ballgame force a game 7 and go down and win in miami miller said today after the pacers practice at conseco fieldhouse so i 'm not counting nothing i 'm not overlooking nothing from them they are a very scary and dangerous team that you got to put the dagger in and you got to make sure the heart ai n't pumping no more because if there 's any type of life in them you never know what 's going to happen so you got to kill the dog hopping onto a flight for game 6 friday night at madison square garden they know the drill having lost in the eastern conference finals four of the past six seasons including the last three in a row whether it was patrick ewing in 1994 or latrell sprewell allan houston and larry johnson in 1999 or the orlando magic of shaquille o'neal and anfernee hardaway in 1995 or the chicago bulls of michael jordan and scottie pippen in 1998 the pacers have fallen short with major free agent questions to be answered in the off season the pacers never have had a greater sense of urgency to close out the knicks i think it is now or never miller said if you ca n't get it done now then there probably will never be another golden opportunity like it is now but like i said it 's up to the 12 guys in the locker room to get it done you can only blame yourself if you do n't get the job done so it 's all on our shoulders mark jackson said we 've been down 3 2 but to be up 3 2 and to have all the pressure on the other team what a great opportunity for us to finally seal the door shut the knicks season is close to expiring because they blew a 37 19 second quarter lead and lost by 88 79 on wednesday in game 5 the game 5 comeback changed the mood inside the pacers locker room i think we 're hungry jalen rose said we need to create a scenario in our locker room that this is n't the third straight year that this is the first time we need to treat it like we 're excited about the moment something that we ca n't take for granted and we 've got to also treat it as though we wo n't get to this point again i think getting down 18 woke us up and made us realize that playoff life is short this is as focused as i 've seen this team coach larry bird said yeah we have our ups and downs but they know what 's on the line here i do n't think they 've ever been in this situation here well maybe when they played new york and new york came in here and beat 'em and then beat 'em in a game 7 but this a little bit different for the record the dog would not die in 1994 miller is the lone pacer holdover from that season and he remembers well how indiana let the series slip away the parallels are almost eerie the pacers had a 3 2 lead after a pulsating game 5 victory at the garden and needed only to close out the knicks in game 6 at market square arena or game 7 at the garden they could not do it if i remember right it 's all the little things miller said rebounds loose balls throughout the course of a game making shots and defending will take care of itself but it 's who does the little things that really separated us from new york in '94 i think they got all the loose balls a lot of second shots and they played much harder i remember them getting up big and us coming back but we could never get over that hump in '94 the largest obstacle next to outplaying the knicks may be overcoming their recent misfortune at madison square garden indiana has not won at the garden since game 4 of last season having dropped five straight games going back to larry johnson 's controversial 4 point play in game 3 of the 1999 conference finals they have had their share of bad calls on the knicks floor we do n't count five straight jackson said there 's been fluke calls there 's been missed calls to be quite honest which happens we feel we have n't put together 48 minutes of basketball at madison square garden the last couple times especially games 3 and 4 if they played poorly in game 3 the pacers were abysmal in game 4 on memorial day unable to stop the knicks on defense and find an offensive rhythm until it was too late miller 's fondest memory is of knocking the knicks out at the garden in game 7 of the second round playoff series in 1995 given the opportunity to have one place to get the job done other than our place that would be the top choice jackson said it 'll be a lot of fun and should be a great time tomorrow night in new york city finally jackson was asked how it felt to be so close to advancing to the finals unbelievable he said i thought about it last night i got a little choked up just thinking about it we 're right there and it 's great to be right there but it 's nothing like being there i do n't want to look at it and say 'we were right there we have to knock down the door because we 're facing a team that has no quit they 're not going to lay down tomorrow and it 's up to us to go into madison square garden in an ideal situation for us and take care of business and then dance
 commissioner david stern announced today that the yugoslav forward darko milicic was eligible to enter the nba draft this year repealing a bylaw that the players union had promised to fight today the 7 foot milicic will be 18 on june 20 six days before the draft the league which had previously said that international players needed to be 18 years old 45 days before the draft will now welcome those turning 18 in the calendar year of the draft he was totally shocked and he was ecstatic milicic 's agent marc cornstein said after reaching milicic in yugoslavia what he said was 'my dream is about to come true milicic who has played professionally for three years in europe is projected to be the second overall pick behind lebron james we think it 's a fair idea and a good idea stern said adding that the league 's lawyers would formally change the rule next week american players are eligible for the draft once they complete high school
 jeff weaver was back in the clubhouse after giving up six runs in seven innings out on the field his new yankees teammates were finishing an easy victory over the toronto blue jays it must have seemed absurd it is not like this where he comes from jason giambi was also in the clubhouse at yankee stadium done for the day after a double a triple and two runs batted in incredulously and rhetorically weaver asked him all i 've got to do is stay in the game and i get a 'w here yesterday as it often is with the yankees that was true weaver won his yankees debut 10 6 despite allowing three runs in the first and three in the fifth he was perfect in his other five innings and mike stanton retired all six hitters he faced at the end of the game when the blue jays hit weaver they hit him hard but the yankees muscle made it moot it 's a whole different ballgame for sure said weaver who had spent his career with the hapless detroit tigers before friday 's trade to the yankees i have n't seen 10 runs all year the tigers have not scored 10 runs in any game this season the yankees lead the majors in runs scored weaver has a losing record this season 7 8 and for his career 40 51 but that figures to change soon he comes at you at a weird angle none of his balls go straight and he throws hard said derek jeter whose two run homer in the sixth put the yankees ahead to stay you do n't like facing him so you might as well get him on your team that is what the yankees did though the trade did not come easily the yankees had identified weaver to improve their aging rotation earlier this season but the tigers wanted first baseman nick johnson in return and the yankees would not trade him the yankees still hoped to make a deal with prospects but after injuries last month to pitcher brandon claussen and outfielder juan rivera the yankees needed a third team to make a deal the oakland athletics obliged getting weaver for first baseman carlos pena a prospect and a player to be named then shipping him to the yankees for pitcher ted lilly and two prospects the quality of weaver 's stuff was obvious to the yankees and general manager brian cashman received positive reports about his makeup weaver competes intensely showing emotion on the mound and a scowl in the clubhouse on days he pitches fire and brimstone blood and guts cashman said those are the words that came to mind when i asked a lot of questions from a lot of people i engaged anybody who was close to him and they all told us the same thing he 's competitive to a fault if you can be weaver showed that by his reactions yesterday when vernon wells ripped a hanging curveball for a three run homer in the fifth weaver never turned to watch it he took a few slow steps in front of the mound clenching his fist raging he sat alone in a corner of the dugout manager joe torre caught him screaming into his glove as he walked off the mound weaver told himself to stay calm as he warmed up in the bullpen but when he took the mound in the first inning in front of 46922 fans he was excited and left his pitches high wells blistered the first pitch to the warning track for a double and carlos delgado smoked the ninth to center for a three run homer you do n't want to continuously hear the boos in the stands but i was expecting it and i was glad to hear it weaver said it got me back where i needed to be once i 'm able to settle down there will be a few more wins there is already one thanks largely to jeter whose homer off corey thurman 1 2 was his first hit since missing two games with a sprained left knee it was the highlight in an otherwise boring day for jeter who hated his first career start at designated hitter what was he doing between at bats eating jeter said if i was a dh i 'd be 300 pounds by august but jeter is healthy again torre said and he will almost certainly be back at shortstop after the all star game break that is when the yankees resume their rumble toward october with an overwhelming offense and a new pitcher who is happy to have the run support but promises to improve i shook his hand and he said 'it 'll get better torre said of weaver but it was fine for me today inside pitch andy pettitte will start the first game after the all star game break in cleveland on thursday followed by roger clemens david wells and mike mussina manager joe torre who has six healthy starters for five spots would not commit to anything beyond that with so many teams needing starters orlando hernandez could be traded before the july 31 deadline perhaps to the expos i think they 'll trade him in a minute said an official of one team that needs a starter the yankees would like to make a trade similar to the 1999 deal that sent hideki irabu to montreal for a package of prospects including ted lilly torre said he would try to play all the yankees infielders at the same time for at least one inning in tomorrow 's all star game alfonso soriano may play the whole game at second torre said but robin ventura has volunteered to back him up of the 75 games on the yankees schedule in the second half 54 are against teams with a losing record
 northern illinois football fans have not had much reason to celebrate since their team gained major college status 34 seasons ago sure there was the california bowl victory in 1983 and there was a triumph over central michigan in 1998 but that brought joy to campus only because it snapped a 23 game losing streak september is early to be thinking about bowl games but northern illinois fans can not help themselves this season the huskies are on a different kind streak a winning streak over nationally ranked teams on aug 28 here northern illinois stunned maryland then ranked no 15 in overtime 20 13 last saturday in tuscaloosa ala the huskies pulled off another upset defeating alabama which was no 21 19 16 how monumental were these victories only two other times had the huskies knocked off a ranked opponent northern illinois a university surrounded by endless cornfields 55 miles west of chicago is now in the center of the national spotlight for the first time the huskies are nationally ranked at no 20 any time a team is ranked it 's exciting and it gives you instant credibility said coach joe novak whose team is 3 0 for the first time since 1988 i can walk in now to talk to recruits since we 're on tv a little bit and in the national rankings kids know who we are while northern illinois has had only 10 winning seasons since 1969 there were signs at the start of this season that it was on the doorstep of big time success in the relative obscurity of the mid american conference northern illinois had put together three consecutive winning seasons 6 5 6 5 and 8 4 and shared the conference 's west division title the past two seasons anyone who still scoffs at the mac should re examine last saturday 's results marshall upended no 6 kansas state and toledo downed no 9 pittsburgh the mac definitely opened eyes last weekend huskies quarterback josh haldi said i do n't think people gave us the respect we deserved in the past he added when northern illinois plays outside the mac it aims for the stratosphere last season it lost to wisconsin in madison by 3 points and two seasons ago it nearly beat illinois in champaign by the time they played at alabama the northern illinois juniors and seniors were used to mammoth marching bands and stadiums that dwarf their 30000 seat home it 's nothing new for us tailback michael turner said of playing traditional powerhouses once you do it once doing it again is like riding a bike northern illinois had another reason to enter this season with the slightest of swaggers turner was the top returning rusher and all purpose yardage gainer in division i which includes divisions i a and i aa he ran for 1915 yards and gained 2284 all purpose yards in 2002 as a junior turner like a majority of his teammates is from illinois and was recruited by only northern illinois but he torched alabama for 156 rushing yards behind a young line he is averaging 1267 yards a game this season eight years ago when novak left his position as indiana 's defensive coordinator to become the huskies coach words like rankings were not uttered in dekalb novak 58 turned the program around gradually by preaching he said all those corny things patience discipline and hard work he said he recruited players who bought into this philosophy and were willing to endure more losing before winning would arrive one player novak will not get to coach again is shea fitzgerald who was among 12 people killed when the porch of a chicago apartment building collapsed in june the death of fitzgerald an offensive lineman who showed tremendous potential as a sophomore last season was devastating but it pulled our team together that much more because we used each other to deal with it novak said before every game the huskies talk about fitzgerald and his memory serves as inspiration as they try to achieve their only goal this season our goal we have one and the kids picked this i did n't is to be mid american champions novak said are we national championship caliber i do n't know about that but i sure know that we can get in the mix with some people you will not catch maryland and alabama disagreeing
 to the editor physicians are taught on day 1 that detailed clinical examination and history are paramount unfortunately by graduation the emphasis on clinical skills is replaced by batteries of diagnostic testing as a resident i feel that a standardized and mandatory clinical skills test at the end of medical school patient gets role in test for doctors aug 27 would reinforce that importance the practice has already ensured that only the best foreign medical graduates practice in the united states and at a small cost ensures that the already high quality of american physicians remains so dr munib mundia garden city ny
 knicks coach jeff van gundy spent the all star game break wearing his thinking cap pondering ways to get latrell sprewell allan houston and glen rice more court time together but after four days of analysis van gundy came up with nothing more than a greater appreciation for the problem created by the three man logjam van gundy said that starting the big backcourt of sprewell and houston was out of the question because it weakened the knicks on defense where they are the strongest and while rice has played well in spurts at power forward van gundy believes it is unrealistic to expect the 6 foot 8 rice to play an extended amount of time at that position in every game i thought a lot about it van gundy said after practice today an hour or so before the knicks flew to denver for tuesday 's game against the nuggets 27 24 it 's the same age old problem it 's just a tough situation for glen to be in i think he 's handled himself extremely well rice 's role was the most controversial issue facing the knicks 29 18 over their first 47 games and it looks as if it could be a problem for the rest of the season while the possibility exists a trade before the feb 22 deadline is unlikely because of rice 's age 33 contract four years 36 million and current bout with a strained arch in his left foot moreover the knicks who have been shopping rice for much of the season are beginning to value his contributions in fact his solid play of late particularly in light of his injury is beginning to create the feeling in the locker room and on the coaching staff that the more rice plays the better the knicks are in the 17 games in which rice who is averaging a career low 297 minutes has played at least 32 minutes the knicks are 11 6 if we 're going to be successful glen has to play well and play a lot sprewell said you guys have seen a couple of games where he 's really shot the ball well and kind of won some games for us just had everybody on his back if my playing point guard is what we have to do to help get him more minutes more time on the floor and more shots then that 's what needs to be done sprewell houston and rice started 16 games together while charlie ward was sidelined after right knee surgery on nov 27 the knicks were 10 6 in those games but while the statistics suggest otherwise van gundy insists that their defense was poor it is true that sprewell had a hard time keeping opposing point guards from breaking down the knicks defense by penetrating the lane over all the knicks held their opponents to 412 percent shooting which is lower than their season average of 418 percent rice would love to give the big backcourt another try like we 've said from day 1 with us three it can definitely work rice said referring to houston sprewell and himself you have three of the best players in the league at any given time either one of us can break you down shoot over you post you up and that 's a big advantage for our team but whether i get more minutes or not i 'm going to go out there and try and do what i can to give support for the team and do whatever i can to get a win rice whose solid defense has been one of the season 's biggest surprises has also proven to be a better rebounder than advertised against smaller teams like milwaukee rice can be effective at power forward but on most nights van gundy does not feel comfortable playing him there not surprisingly rice who averages 43 rebounds thinks he is up to the task i 'm beginning to like that power forward spot rice said with a smile i feel like i 'm one of the bigger guys now i 've always been a good rebounder and i think one of the things i 'm able to do is get to the ball a little bit quicker than the bigger power forwards and on the offensive end i think it 's a big advantage for us as well still if sprewell houston and rice are to play a great deal together it will be in the big backcourt alignment especially come playoff time while van gundy likes having a traditional point guard in the game he has been going to the big backcourt more often last week he played that unit for the last 12 minutes of the knicks double overtime victory over dallas and for the final 17 minutes of a loss to houston when asked if over the weekend he seriously considered returning to sprewell and houston as the starting guards van gundy said no no no but certainly the last two games have proven that i think we can finish with it and i do n't know down the road what 's going to happen rebounds the knicks start the second half of the season five and a half games behind atlantic division leading philadelphia 36 14 they have a great opportunity to make up some ground because the 76ers all star center theo ratliff will have his fractured right wrist in a cast for the next two weeks ratliff the league 's leading shot blocker will then be re evaluated and will either have his wrist placed in another cast for two to four weeks or undergo surgery while philadelphia 's misfortune could work in the knicks favor the knicks schedule is about to get tougher after playing at denver on tuesday the knicks visit utah on wednesday also after having four separate breaks of three days off between games in january the knicks get no more than one day off between their 19 games over the next five weeks
 when the giants see the eagles they see green and white which of course also happens to be the color of money like instant cash the eagles have provided the giants an anchor for their season twice in each of the last four years it is now eight straight giants victories in this series and counting the latest a 24 7 mauling yesterday at giants stadium it is odd and perplexing in pro football when one team has a whammy on another tennessee enjoys that kind of hex over jacksonville kansas city used to do it to oakland just as san francisco used to cruelly batter the rams notice that those are all division matchups this latest giants eagles thing started when jim fassel became the giants coach in 1997 before that the eagles had won four straight in the series back in the late 1970 's the eagles won 11 straight but for the current bunch of eagles that irrelevant all they know is that they look like ants to the giants elephants they opened our eyes eagles receiver torrance small said we came in here 5 3 and feeling good about ourselves they made us realize that if we are going to have the kind of season we want we have to have the right attitude cornerback troy vincent said right now you have to give it to them they have our number we would love to play them a third time this season how many teams can beat you three times in a season the way things are going in this series the giants could beat the eagles 10 times this season and hardly break a sweat their defense was making plays eagles cornerback bobby taylor said and our defense was having trouble stopping their offense so i guess their offense was making plays too there are a lot of similarities up and down our division between teams owning other teams that is the nfc east it 's been that way for a while and it is not going to change in this series though we have to lick our wounds just like the giants bow down against washington they have lost four straight to the redskins the giants were 1 3 recently against dallas before beating them two sundays ago the eagles scored 41 points at dallas this year they lost by only 17 14 to washington and the giants lost to washington by 10 points earlier this season the eagles are bold and confident against dallas and washington the giants are not against the same teams but eagles giants the eagles keep looking spooked the ebb and flow of divisional series affect every team 's season and destiny if each team plays 16 games and half are in its division that is where the mark as a team must be carved fassel clearly understands this his giants teams have produced 7 0 1 5 3 and 3 5 divisional records his current team is 4 1 in the division that helps make the giants contenders in their division and beyond i do n't know we respect them a lot giants guard ron stone said when asked to explain the streak one of the things we do against them is we keep establishing the run we may not get a lot early but by the end of the game it piles up and tires them out that team is talented and young up and coming is the way giants cornerback andre weathers described the eagles you knew after the way we beat them the first time they would come gunpowder ready weathers said we knew we had to bring our a game in big games it 's all about what team will show up at that particular time and the giants repeatedly have no problem showing their best against the eagles the giants ran the ball 44 times they gained 25 first downs over all the eagles only 8 the giants held the ball for nearly three quarters sometimes when you walk out on that field you just know it that you are going to beat your man today and that you are going to win giants running back greg comella said that is happening for us against philadelphia confidence is born out of demonstrated ability so how do the giants gain those traits against washington how do they make their 6 2 season become much more by playing every team in the manner that they play the eagles in our practices for washington and tennessee tackle lomas brown said about the giants two losses we were kind of tight a lot of times when a coach is getting pressure from upstairs it rolls right downstairs and the players are the first to know it but this week i saw guys practicing relaxed and with confidence guys worked hard had fun and were loose that is how the game of football is supposed to be played we can be pretty good when we 're not a tight team guys were flying around saying 'let 's keep them under our thumb and 'we know what they got so let 's hit them into submission yes big hits hurt speed kills big plays dominate but pro football is a mind game the winners know
 to the editor after 20 years of teaching high school and college science i have nothing but sympathy for the quandary posed in odds are stacked when science tries to debate pseudoscience essay april 30 part of the problem lies in the failure of science education to deal with the nature of science most science classes omit any discussion of the issues that separate science and pseudoscience the nature of scientific claims the limits of science and the tests of evidence used by scientists although continuing attention to the nature of science throughout the curriculum might not eliminate pseudoscientific beliefs it could at least lead to more informed debate further it might avoid the absurdity epitomized by one college senior who claimed that she had never taken a science class when i said that surely she must have taken chemistry or biology she responded oh yes i took chemistry but i did n't know that was science dr dorothy b rosenthal florence mass
 for the first time in more than two months eric lindros has been given medical clearance to play hockey after lindros participated in a brief practice session with his teammates here today philadelphia flyers coach craig ramsay announced that lindros who has suffered five concussions in two years will be in the lineup wednesday against the devils in game 6 of the eastern conference finals at continental arena asked about the possibility of suffering a grave injury by playing lindros said anytime you play the game freak things happen i 've been medically cleared to play lindros has been sidelined since march 13 because of recurrent concussions i put a lot of time into my decision coach craig ramsay said it was a tough decision a hard decision i wanted to be fair to everyone but eric said all the right things he seemed very sincere in his desire to come back he 's been a big part of this team for a long time i felt he deserved that opportunity having said that and with his team just one victory away from a berth in the stanley cup finals ramsay imposed a gag order on the rest of his players who stripped lindros of his captaincy on march 27 after sunday night 's 4 1 loss to new jersey in philadelphia which brought the devils to within three games to two in the four of seven game series many of the flyers did not seem enthusiastic about lindros 's return eric has talked to some of the players ramsay said we did n't demand that he stand up there and beg this was between the coaches and the players and i have instructed the rest of the players to have no comment you 've heard from eric and from me it 's a team decision everybody supported it and we 're not going to deal with this anymore we 've said what we had to say the issue is closed to the rest of the players otherwise it 's going to just drive us crazy because of the multiple concussions lindros has sustained three in the last year two since march 4 there are those who think he would be risking his long term health when asked about the dangers of coming back to a series that his teammate john leclair has already said is the bloodiest he has ever been part of lindros said it 's a physical series and i look forward to being part of it ramsay made sure to stress that lindros will have to earn his time on the ice he understands that he accepts that said ramsay we 've talked about his role what he can do what will be best for him it will be a limited role but we feel he will be a great addition to the club we 'll see how it goes once the game gets started we 're excited to have him back some more than others but lindros seemed earnest when he indicated that he will do anything his coach and teammates ask of him including fit into the unselfish system that they have played in lindros absence i think i can help out lindros said obviously i 'm not going to play 18 to 25 minutes a game it will be a much lighter role than that i 'm just getting back into it ramsay said he would n't initially put lindros out on the power play but i would imagine he 'd get some power play time ramsay said when asked what lindros brings to the flyers rick tocchet said obviously the shot and it 's going to give somebody else that extra second somewhere on the ice off the ice however lindros brings baggage lindros who almost certainly will be traded by the flyers after the playoffs end has been embroiled in a season long series of disputes with the philadelphia general manager bob clarke and lindros 's health has been just one of a number of off ice incidents including ramsay 's succession of the ailing roger neilson and the stripping of lindros 's captaincy in favor of eric desjardins that have dogged the team when asked if the lindros saga continues to be a distraction ramsay answered sarcastically nooooooo our team has had to deal with everything imaginable ramsay said i 've been in this game almost 30 years and i 've never seen anything happen as to what has happened to this team and i 've also never seen a better response part of the reason has been the flyers ability to come together in lindros 's absence but the most important thing we have to focus on is that we 're 60 minutes away from the stanley cup final said desjardins and nothing can come in and distract us from that not even lindros or so the flyers hope
 new year 's day has the reputation for renewal for being the time when we take stock and set goals and cast off bad habits and worn out socks but thinking people know that the true moment for such stuff is now when summer gives way to fall the three month vacation mind set is reluctantly jettisoned a collective deep breath is taken and we all regird our loins figuratively speaking except for those of us who play football for a living that is what we hope to do in this column regird that is not play football we hope to a tie up a loose end b set our sights on new mysteries that need conquering and c offer nominations for things that should be thrown out along with those old socks in the loose ends department we offer one last look at the great 20 giveaway in june you 'll recall we spread five 20 bills around and asked the finders to tell us how they spent the money then last month we harshly indeed rudely scolded the entire state because none of the finders had played along this caused two things to happen 1 several smart alecks we know suggested rightly that the only numbskull in the story was the one who had frittered away 100 2 amy ryan sent us a letter ms ryan who now lives in north carolina but until a few weeks ago lived in princeton junction confessed to finding the 20 we had left at the plainsboro public library she would have written sooner she said but well there was the small chore of moving she said the column containing our scolding had shamed her into finally telling her tale which turns out to have an astonishing twist my daughter bailey 7 and i read about the hunt early that saturday morning and just as we were getting ready to leave for plainsboro bailey 's grandfather frank ryan from whiting called to let us know about it too she wrote we ran right in as the doors opened and found the book and the bill after a bit of fevered hunting here 's the eerie part in delivering our scolding we had suggested that a good place to send found money was the popcorn park zoo which takes in abused animals the ryans incredibly reported that they had already given the 20 to the zoo even before reading that advice our head has been spinning at this coincidence ever since which ends the 20 giveaway tale and leads into part two of today 's column shocking and unexplained things that we think someone perhaps even us should investigate now that vacation season is over 1 a few days ago we came home to find a message on the answering machine from a worker at newark airport he advised that the turtles we had just picked up at the airport had not been cleared by government inspectors and should immediately be brought back we 're fairly sure this man dialed our number by mistake since we ca n't recall picking up any turtles at the airport and that 's the kind of thing we generally remember questions have been nagging us ever since is whoever did pick up the turtles still walking around with them endangering the public in untold ways who inspects turtles and for what why did n't the caller from the airport leave a number 2 on the northeast corridor rail line near linden a half dozen tracks run parallel someone has discarded a rather bulky typewriter there not on the edge of the track bed where most litter lives but between tracks four and five every time we zip by this typewriter we want to know more did someone really tiptoe across several live train tracks to deposit it there did a frustrated writer heave it out the window of a train if so how since train windows do n't open 3 recently we got a call asking if we would participate in a french fry taste test this was serious business and we had to sign a confidentiality agreement which is why you will not read whose fries were being tested but we will reveal that the testers asked were the fries too potatoey not potatoey enough or just right we were astounded who knew there were degrees of potatoeyness are there also degrees of tomatoeyness and carrotyness so we have plenty to ponder as we exit summer and wade back into the workaday world to free up brain cells for this pondering we have vowed to devote no more mental energy to a dozen or so worn out subjects these among them cell phone etiquette survivors those fiberglass cows the frisking photograph the weather we suggest you make a similar list as part of your regirding process and you with the turtles turn yourself in you know who you are

 michael strahan beat eagles tackle jon runyan to the inside early in the second quarter monday night driving runyan backward before shoving him aside with a swipe of the right hand strahan it appeared would have a shot at donovan mcnabb runyan flailing to stay in the play popped strahan in the face mask with his left hand and as runyan spun and turned his backside toward strahan lifted his right foot and hooked strahan across the legs taking him down all of this directly in front of the referee strahan was slightly injured and had to leave the game briefly but there was no flag on the play one of many that have fueled the belief in the giants organization that in the first season after strahan broke the record for sacks rules do not seem to apply when it comes to stopping him as if strahan has become the shaquille o'neal of the nfl if anybody watches the games and the tapes the guy is getting a little mugged said denny marcin the giants defensive line coach some of it 's ok and some of it 's not but wow you would think the guy would get a little respect because they know he 's getting double  and triple teamed it 's not happening for sure the giants were back at practice today and coach jim fassel began preparing for his former role of play caller fassel informed the players on wednesday that he was relieving offensive coordinator sean payton of that responsibility but did not confirm the change for reporters until today it 's been awhile but it 's like riding a bike fassel said strahan had 22 1 2 sacks last season and this year he believes his play is being officiated much differently than in past seasons i came through the middle on one play and i had one referee tell me 'i would 've called holding if you were n't being double teamed strahan who has four sacks this season said i 'm still trying to figure that out another one said 'you 're supposed to be a superior player i just do n't get it san francisco 's scott gragg a former giant was called for holding strahan during the season opener the only such penalty against an offensive linemen opposite strahan this season i do n't know what a hold is any more strahan said i 'm at the point where if i say anything to the refs it does n't do anything because they do n't call anything and they throw god knows how many holding calls on our guys i 've gotten used to the fact that you can basically tie my shoelaces together and nothing is called strahan sat out a handful of plays after runyan took him down receiving some minor treatment on the sideline before returning to battle runyan if runyan 's tactics bothered him it did n't immediately reflect in the way he played strahan charged up the field time and again without appearing to take an unnecessary shot at the tackle what you 've got to do is fight through that stuff as best you can marcin said but it gets tough after a while strahan mused about the possibility of retaliating in forthcoming games but i know if i punched him in the face i 'll get called for it strahan said referring to opposing linemen if the offensive guy does it nothing is called it 's not a fair society i guess the other giants linemen review game tape every week and they say they are amazed at what opposing teams have done against strahan without being flagged matt mitrione a reserve defensive tackle said that on one play a lineman yanked strahan to the ground by his shoulder pad as a running back blocked into the back of strahan 's leg he gets abused mitrione said kenny holmes the giants other defensive end said he 's a great player and people are going to do everything they can to get him out of his game cheap shots and a lot the other stuff is n't called and you can go back and review the film and see all this stuff heck yeah there 's a lot of it marcin said strahan has been good about keeping his concentration rather than being distracted by what he believes are missed calls once in a while he 'll show some frustration out there go up to the referee and say something marcin said but for the most part he knows it 's part of the game and part of what 's going to happen to him every game you just go on with it and live with it and hopefully we 'll get some things that go our way extra points receiver ike hilliard will miss the rest of the season because of a dislocated right shoulder but in a strange way the injury could increase the chances that he will return to the giants after becoming a free agent hilliard has had major injuries to his neck right big toe and shoulder that might concern other organizations and limit their bidding for him but the giants would welcome back hilliard enthusiastically so long as club executives feel they can fit his salary within their salary cap structure guards dusty zeigler knee and rich seubert back missed practice today and although seubert will most likely play against jacksonville jason whittle who is coming back from a back injury could replace zeigler tam hopkins is also a possibility

for seconds in a rainbow of time and space that has spanned 101 games this season swish kidd smiled if only winning a game in the nba finals were that easy if only the nets knew before the

the swingman kobe bryant and coach phil jackson who is going for his record tying ninth nba championship the lakers hold one intangible the nets can not counter experience they understand what it takes to win at this level the nets kerry kittles said and it 's something that this young team is trying to adapt to and something we 're trying to learn from from early in game 1 when the nets froze with stage fright to late in game 3 when they prematurely celebrated a 7 point lead in the fourth quarter and the times in between when they slashed 20 something point leads to 6 or fewer only to fall short they have indeed resembled a team making its first appearance in the nba finals these were all points in a series that we as a team that 's been there recognize the severity of the moment or what the moments are that you need to capture and play well and they 're just learning that lakers forward rick fox said those moments are passing the nets by fox said until after the fact they 're recognizing 'wow that was a classic opportunity and we 're just a step ahead he added nets forward keith van horn admitted that games 1 and 2 in los angeles were a circus new jersey missed 11 free throws in game 1 10 in game 2 the nets have not boxed out and have watched the lakers outrebound them in every game by an average of seven that takes experience to understand how important each possession is lakers point guard derek fisher said neither o'neal 's arthritic right toe nor any nets defense has stopped o'neal from averaging 37 points and 13 rebounds a game when asked what the nets could have done differently kittles laughed and said stepped on shaq 's toe we 've been pulling out a lot of stops i think we 're running out of stops to pull richard jefferson said remember shaq is an unstoppable force and kobe feeds off of that short of signing up for acting lessons from sacramento 's vlade divac nets coach byron scott said his centers todd macculloch aaron williams and jason collins were not hip to that stuff yet macculloch is the only nets player with nba finals experience as a backup with philadelphia last season the sixers interrupted the lakers undefeated run through the playoffs by winning game 1 before the lakers won four straight closing out the series on philadelphia 's home court the nets hope to avoid seeing the champagne spray on their account they already survived reggie miller and the indiana pacers in double overtime of game 5 of the first round but no team has come back from a 3 0 deficit it 's almost written down as being impossible scott said but i also know that if we go out and compete and we do n't let our guards down and they let their guards down we win a game and then we win the next game then it 's a series again scott said six teams have swept the finals scott 's lakers were swept in 1989 but won titles in 1985 1987 and 1988 i could talk until i 'm blue in the face on what the championship is like and what the nba finals is like but until you actually get there and get to play in it it 's really just words he said for the lakers it is more than that now i think that swagger has come through experience jefferson said right now we 're just still trying to figure them out the nets might be learning too late for this year slowly we are climbing the ladder van horn said i think we are finally now at the point where we know what we are capable of and know what we can do against this team rebounds during his state of the nba address commissioner david stern said that the league would introduce instant replay next season for last second shots and that the games in the nba finals would start at 8 30 pm eastern time if the league realigns in the 2003 4 season the memphis grizzlies and the minnesota timberwolves have asked for travel convenience to be placed in the eastern conference in response to limiting shaquille o'neal 's dominance stern said i did say to one owner 'perhaps we would consider a sixth man rule so that all the teams playing the lakers could have six men on the court as long as shaquille is in

 president clinton strongly criticized republicans today for blocking his african american and hispanic judicial nominees and he urged delegates to the annual convention of the naacp to elect vice president al gore to ensure that the courts remained diverse one of the most important responsibilities of the next president is appointing judges said mr clinton who predicted that over the next four years there would be two to four supreme court vacancies more than a score of court of appeals vacancies and more than 100 openings on federal district courts mr clinton called it outrageous that the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit which has the highest percentage of african american residents of any judicial area is without a single black judge he singled out for criticism senator jesse helms republican of north carolina whom the president blamed for blocking his nominees mr clinton also said the presumptive republican presidential nominee gov george w bush of texas had remained silent when republicans in that state blocked a hispanic nominee enrique moreno to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit the quality of justice suffers when highly qualified women and minority candidates fully vetted fully supported by the american bar association are denied the opportunity to serve for partisan political reasons the president said mr clinton took a break from the middle east peace talks today to make his final address as president to the national association for the advancement of colored people which helped turn out black voters for mr clinton in 1992 and 1996 i had to come to baltimore today mr clinton said likening the spirit of freedom and reconciliation of the naacp with what he is seeking in the middle east when he took the podium mr clinton quickly transformed from peacemaker to politician he praised mr bush for not avoiding the naacp convention as the republican presidential nominee in 1996 bob dole had done but mr clinton said he thought mr gore had delivered the better speech of the two presidential contenders and would make the better president members of the audience clapped politely when mr bush spoke on monday they jumped to their feet after mr gore 's address on wednesday but they saved a hero 's welcome for mr clinton today we 've had a lot of vice presidents a lot of vice presidents made great presidents thomas jefferson teddy roosevelt harry truman lyndon johnson mr clinton said but we 've never had a vice president that did so much good as vice president as al gore never not ever in the history of the country as mr gore had done in his speech on wednesday mr clinton quoted from the bible in his remarks citing ecclesiastes 11 25 in the day of prosperity there is forgetfulness of affliction the president said this period of economic growth is the ideal time to focus on the less fortunate he reminded the audience of his first visit to an naacp convention in 1992 when he was governor of arkansas and mr gore was a senator from tennessee i pledged then and i want to quote it exactly i do n't want to miss a word i pledged you 'an administration that looks like america one that knows the promise and the pain of this country one that will rebuild reunite and renew the american spirit mr clinton said i think together we have honored that pledge the naacp is a nonpartisan organization but the political preferences of those in the audience were clear they jumped to their feet applauded loudly and cried out as the president spoke we do n't endorse politicians said julian bond the chairman of the naacp but we know how to recognize our friends and this president is our friend
 it was the eve of minnesota 's opening game when coach glen mason got some unexpected good news the eligibility papers of his place kicker rhys lloyd had finally cleared and lloyd a native of dover england would be available for the season but the next day on the sideline when it was time to send lloyd out for the opening kickoff mason had a problem i could n't remember his name mason recalled i knew he was a brit and i 'm a big admirer of winston churchill so i just called out for 'winston until i got his attention mason certainly knows his name after lloyd booted two field goals saturday in a 20 14 victory over penn state that made lloyd 6 for 6 this season and helped stake the gophers to a 5 0 start moving them up to no 21 in the associated press news media poll farther south the whole state of arkansas should know who the sophomore backup chris balseiro is after he converted a 19 yarder in double overtime to defeat alabama 34 31 keeping the razorbacks undefeated and moving them to no 8 and finally there is tyler fredrickson of california who kicked a 51 yarder and had two attempts blocked before knocking through a 38 yarder that stunned no 3 ranked southern california in triple overtime 34 31 it has been an odd college football season marked by last week 's powerhouses becoming this week 's disappointments so it was fitting that kickers an often embattled and always anonymous breed made it even stranger the trojans 3 1 were supposed to be the class of the west they had an 11 game winning streak and national championship aspirations and had provided cal 3 3 with enough bulletin board fodder that the golden bears believed they were being overlooked they always take us lightly the senior receiver jonathan makonnen said they really do n't respect us in racing to a 21 7 lead cal got the attention of the trojans who rallied for 17 points and a 24 24 tie to force overtime near the end of regulation usc blocked a 51 yard attempt by fredrickson in the first overtime the trojans broke through to bat down a 29 yard effort that would have won the game while kickers quirky personalities are a part of football lore the kickers are often quite smart as fredrickson demonstrated on his game winner a 6 3 senior he looked like a quarterback barking last minute instructions to his teammates we moved the ball back about a yard said fredrickson a former walk on it 's not the way you 'd do things ideally but they had blocked two kicks it got to the point where i was going to do anything necessary to end this game i never doubted that last kick arkansas 4 0 turned to balseiro after the first string kicker david carlton missed two early field goals and the razorbacks fell behind by 31 10 midway through the third quarter in the second overtime however arkansas improbable comeback looked futile when crimson tide kicker brian bostick lined up for a 38 yard potential game winner it went wide left instead of being daunted by a raucous crowd at alabama 's bryant denny stadium balseiro a walk on assuredly made good on his chance to end the game it 's an amazing feeling he said i dream about this every day in a topsy turvy season in which oregon looked like a worldbeater one week upsetting michigan only to be trounced the next by washington state a national title may ride on the toe of an overlooked place kicker for evidence look no further than the top three spots in the polls trey dicarlo is 7 of 8 for top ranked oklahoma jon peattie is 5 of 6 for no 2 miami and mike nugent an all american last year is 7 of 8 for no 3 ranked and defending national champion ohio state this is not lost on mason he has found an extraordinary talent in lloyd who did not begin kicking a football until his senior year in a minneapolis area high school and spent two years in junior college refining his technique lloyd is the first gopher to handle kicking and punting duties since gino cappelletti did in 1954 lloyd already has two field goals from beyond 50 yards is 25 of 25 on point after attempts and is averaging 42 yards a punt with a continental panache in a nod to his soccer playing roots he rolls to his right and sidewinds his punts against penn state he recovered his own onside kick to open the game and later pinned the nittany lions on their own 6 yard line with a 51 yard punt he 's a musician with the ball and he 's earning his scholarship i can tell you that mason said but i still call him winston lloyd shrugs off his coach 's nickname i do n't mind as long as he calls me when we need points he said no doubt that in the coming saturdays mason will be calling on his kicker at critical times so will every other college coach how these specialists respond may be the difference between earning a spot in the national title game or not

 others may have been worried about the liberty last week not coach richie adubato a former nba coach adubato had seen the best of teams spiral toward despair then rise above even when the liberty lost its last three home games of the season the first time in adubato 's four year tenure the team had lost three in a row at home adubato said that he was not worried that his team of all stars and experienced veterans would come back but that was before friday night when the liberty experienced its worst playoff defeat a 73 55 loss to the indiana fever in indianapolis it was before the liberty was humbled and humiliated by a team playing its first wnba playoff game before the fever took a 1 0 lead in the first round of the two of three game series before the liberty found itself on the brink of elimination heading into game 2 at madison square garden today if adubato was not worried after his team lost four of its last five regular season games and played without purpose or enthusiasm he surely must be worried now the liberty looked helpless against a younger and more inspired team a team that clinched the final playoff spot in the eastern conference on the last day of the regular season the liberty had no one who could match tamika catchings a 6 foot 2 forward who scored a game high 29 points and added 11 rebounds 4 assists and 3 steals she also made four 3 pointers catchings 's 29 points exceeded the combined total of the liberty 's starting forwards tamika whitmore 18 and crystal robinson 10 the liberty was also hurt by coquese washington a point guard who finished with 13 points 11 in the second half and who ran circles around teresa weatherspoon the liberty 's two time all star point guard they beat us in every category adubato said catchings was unbelievable we did n't help ourselves we tried to catch up quickly and did n't shoot the ball well they were the superior team this day the liberty shot 22 of 53 from the floor and was 9 of 12 from the free throw line the fever was 28 of 55 from the floor 11 of 15 from the line the disparity was in 3 point percentage the liberty was 2 of 11 in 3 point goals and the fever was 6 of 14 the fever also outrebounded the liberty 35 24 the liberty returned home yesterday afternoon and conducted a closed door practice adubato has designed several new plays he used one of them against the washington mystics on aug 9 to help clinch the top spot in the east he may have to unleash his entire arsenal this afternoon to keep the liberty from another disappointing end to its pursuit of a wnba title the liberty has been a better team at home 10 6 than on the road 8 8 catchings named the league 's rookie of the year friday did n't respond well to the fullcourt press that helped hold her to 13 points in the liberty 's 74 55 victory over the fever at the garden on june 25 even experienced veterans like washington and nikki mccray of the fever are not as effective at the garden as they are at conseco fieldhouse in indianapolis it 's going to be a different game in new york said fever coach nell fortner who began preparing her team yesterday morning for what it might face today but the air of invincibility the liberty once exuded at the garden has diminished in the past when the liberty found itself backed into a wall it would look elsewhere for motivation like the smiles on the faces of its opponents they celebrated a lot tonight the liberty 's robinson said after friday 's game you have to be careful about waking up a sleeping giant a couple of years ago houston got beat really bad by a team that celebrated on them and came back and won it all the fever 's intensity will be matched at the garden
 for those who wanted more evidence that southern california was a serious contender for the national championship today 's rout of hawaii should do usc ranked no 4 in the associated press poll made up for a slow start and rolled to a 61 32 victory before a crowd of 73654 at the los angeles memorial coliseum the trojans 3 0 scored at will in the second and third quarters and registered their 11th straight victory their longest winning streak in 23 years this was a particularly good game for our offense usc coach pete carroll said we wanted to see consistency in our running game a lot of things went well for us carroll had good reason to be pleased the trojans rushed for 164 yards and the sophomore quarterback matt leinart who has the difficult assignment of replacing the heisman trophy winner carson palmer completed 15 of 21 passes for 220 yards and 2 touchdowns the trojans scored on their first possession of the game starting on the hawaii 46 after the warriors failed to pull off a fake punt the sophomore tailback hershel dennis carried 4 times for 18 yards as the trojans tried to ignite a rushing attack that had gained only 194 yards in their first two games against auburn and brigham young during the drive the sophomore wide receiver mike williams made his 100th reception in only his 16th game but usc sputtered inside the 10 and had to settle for a 24 yard field goal by ryan killeen hawaii which was anchored by the junior quarterback timmy chang bounced right back chang who missed the team 's season opening game against appalachian state for academic reasons penetrated the highly regarded trojans defense with an assortment of short passes but he could not lead the warriors into the end zone and justin ayat 's 35 yard field goal made the score 3 3 in the second quarter the trojans cashed in on a hawaii blunder after catching a 4 yard pass from chang receiver gerald welch fumbled without being touched usc 's ronald nunn scooped it up and ran 38 yards for the game 's first touchdown giving the trojans a 10 3 lead the warriors rebounded again chang had good protection and kept finding open receivers leading his team 77 yards in 8 plays to a first and goal from the usc 4 yard line but the trojans held hawaii to another ayat field goal on their next possession the trojans went 57 yards in 6 plays to put some distance between them and their unranked opponent tailback reggie bush capped the drive with a 23 yard run and usc was on top by 17 6 the trojans were just getting started after stopping hawaii the tandem of leinart and keary colbert took over leinart hit colbert for a 34 yard gain to hawaii 's 35 two plays later leinart connected with colbert for a 32 yard score the four play 74 yard drive took only 1 minute 30 seconds apparently that was not quick enough for the trojans who marched 64 yards in 36 seconds the next time they had the ball williams took a pass from leinart near hawaii 's 30 yard line eluded several defenders and reached the end zone at the half the trojans led by 31 6 the intermission did not slow usc in the third quarter the trojans moved downfield from their own 35 without much difficulty on third and 9 from the hawaii 27 leinart pitched to bush who fumbled but bush picked it up in a hurry darted to the outside and sprinted to the end zone it only got worse for hawaii the defense played good at times but missed a lot of tackles hawaii coach june jones said in the second and third quarter we missed so many tackles late in the quarter safety jason leach intercepted a chang pass returning it 25 yards for a touchdown a few minutes later defensive end frostee rucker tipped chang 's pass and caught it himself giving the trojans a first and goal on the hawaii 4 tailback lendale white scored two plays later they 're as good as people say they are said chang who completed 32 of his 54 passes for 306 yards and 2 touchdowns
 a special grand jury was seated here today to start a wide ranging inquiry into the dormitory fire at seton hall university in january 2000 that killed three freshmen and injured 58 others it will try to determine who started the blaze and the reasons for its intensity rapid spread and high toll the panel was sworn in by judge joseph a falcone of new jersey superior court the investigation could last until march 15 according to the judge 's order last july that approved the panel and the scope of its inquiry as required by new jersey law the grand jury will operate in secrecy the panel is to meet every thursday said charlotte smith a spokeswoman for the essex county prosecutor donald c campolo mr campolo and jeffrey r cartwright the director of the county arson task force declined comment on the start of the panel 's work it is the last stage of an investigation that included months of tests by federal scientists and engineers into the origin of the fire and the reasons for its searing heat and disorienting black smoke the smoke quickly filled a third floor lounge in boland hall where the fire was started about 4 30 am on jan 19 2000 and then rolled into hallways throughout the dorm in a report last june mr campolo said investigators had determined that the blaze was intentionally started when someone set fire to a paper banner resting on one of three sofas in the lounge the sofa contained polyurethane foam a highly flammable petroleum based substance common in household furniture almost immediately after the sofa began burning the two nearby sofas erupted in flames and the lounge became an inferno filled with blinding smoke within about five minutes mr cartwright said in june the june report suggested that the authorities planned to seek indictments charging one or more people with arson as well as felony murder which state law defines as a homicide that occurs during the commission of another crime in this case the arson in a legal document july 17 asking judge falcone to create the grand jury mr campolo said investigators had interviewed more than 200 people and taken formal statements from about 125 of them the july 17 petition said the interviews and the scientific tests had yielded a large volume of information about the fire 's origins in addition to hearing that evidence the special grand jury is to review material mr campolo 's staff has gathered on other issues that may have contributed to the deaths and injuries the july document said those issues include 19 false alarms in boland hall in the weeks before the fire the enforcement of the new jersey fire code at seton hall and the use of sprinklers and combustible materials in public buildings at the university and elsewhere many freshmen who escaped from boland said they initially ignored fire alarms because of the spate of false alarms earlier in the academic year in the weeks after the blaze state inspectors found more than 800 violations of the state fire code in all the buildings on the seton hall campus state officials also said that the fire safety bureau in the village of south orange where seton hall is located had failed to keep records of annual fire safety inspections at the college as required by state law in the months after the blaze seton hall officials said the university had corrected all fire code violations installed sprinklers in all dorm rooms and cleared all its buildings of furniture similar to the polyurethane foam sofas that burned

 the most exciting aspect of the 2001 2 nba season will be the race for second place barring injury internal discord or a miracle the los angeles lakers will win their third straight championship next june but who earns the right to be the lakers fodder in the finals will be the real story and provide the real drama before he returned to sacramento without seriously considering other teams chris webber should have thought about this if you do n't share a locker room with shaquille o'neal and kobe bryant the eastern conference is the place to be no fewer than seven teams philadelphia milwaukee toronto orlando charlotte miami and the knicks can enter training camp in october with a realistic chance of winning the conference crown i see one legitimate team in this league that looks dominant and that 's the lakers miami coach pat riley said anybody else that begins to sing their own song about dominance failed to look at the playoffs and see the fact that one shot here or there could have changed the fortunes of three or four other teams there 's so much parity and equality there are favorites in the east however the two conference finalists philadelphia and milwaukee have to be placed atop the mix and if the bucks are able to pull off a sign and trade with miami for anthony mason they will be downright scary even so the real powers may be toronto and orlando after maneuvering to get hakeem olajuwon in what for them was a painless sign and trade with houston on paper the raptors are arguably the conference 's best squad and orlando will welcome back grant hill who missed all but four games last season with an ankle injury while adding patrick ewing and horace grant toronto appears to be the most imposing it has the superstar scorer in vince carter the rugged yet skilled power forward in antonio davis outside shooting in alvin williams and morris peterson doggedness in chris childs athletic frontcourt play off the bench in jerome williams and keon clark and now one of the top five or six centers in the league though he is 38 olajuwon could be a force in the east if he remains healthy he has been limited to half seasons the past four years because of injuries and last season nearly had his career ended by a blood clot but after his health was restored olajuwon averaged an impressive 15 points and 9 rebounds over his last 23 games and that was in the rugged west olajuwon who was also being courted by indiana and the knicks now says he has been rejuvenated by his move to toronto it 's going to be fun playing with vince olajuwon said in a conference call thursday night it 's like college and phi slamma jamma we 're going to dunk on people it 's like i 'm a rookie again i 'm excited it raises my curiosity to another level ewing who turns 39 today does not have as much left as olajuwon but he should also be more effective in the east than he was last season in seattle if ewing can stay healthy and provide a respectable post presence on both ends of the floor the magic 's perimeter of hill tracy mcgrady and darrell armstrong should be enough to make it formidable orlando coach doc rivers 's greatest challenge might be getting hill and mcgrady to play well together their games are strikingly similar it will take some time and i know that because they have n't played together rivers said the only thing that 's holding this team back is that all the best parts have n't played together usually it takes time a couple seasons actually but i 'm too impatient for that to happen we have to try and shorten that curve the best part with both of them is that they 're willing passers they do n't mind setting each other up rivers admitted to being unsure of how big a role ewing would play in the regular season but he believes he could be a factor in the playoffs he 's not going to be the patrick ewing that i played with or the patrick ewing that most of the fans remember but he 's still better than half the centers in the nba rivers said he 's a guy who i 'm not sure yet how we 'll use him for us to make it through the playoffs he needs to be strong fresh and healthy part of my job will be to manage the minutes so that can take place if patrick gives us not one quality second on the court he 'll still help the team because his work ethic can rub off on our young guys elsewhere charlotte is hoping to build on its best postseason performance ever the knicks are looking for redemption from first round failure and miami is planning to change its style of play after the heat was swept in the first round by speedier more athletic charlotte riley decided to move away from the plodding bruising style he has espoused since taking over the knicks in 1991 he believes his young perimeter players anthony carter eddie house and ricky davis who will join alonzo mourning brian grant and eddie jones to form the heat 's nucleus will be better in a fast paced game we 'll change our style of play to really enhance the athleticism and enthusiasm of some of these guys riley said i want to get younger more athletic more energy less scars and wounds and hangovers sprewell must accept role marcus camby has spent much of the off season working out and hanging out with latrell sprewell when asked if the popular belief that sprewell was tired of playing with allan houston was true camby answered with a quick not at all but he went on to say that sprewell was tired of playing the small forward or 3 spot from what i 've seen spree 's not upset or anything with allan camby said his biggest thing right now is that he wants to play 2 he feels that 's his natural position he feels he has to guard bigger players every night he 's getting posted up but he does n't say anything he just goes out there and plays the 3 but he definitely wants to play the 2 the 6 foot 5 190 pound sprewell who is currently in milwaukee and could not be reached for comment voiced displeasure with his position last march after being torched for 30 points by the 6 9 shareef abdur rahim in a loss to vancouver he said his inability to guard taller forwards was forcing his teammates to double team too much there is really no answer to sprewell 's plight other than a trade and he does not dislike playing out of position enough to leave new york instead he had better get used to it because houston 's new six year 100 million contract makes him virtually untradeable the fact of the matter is that if sprewell is going to be a knick he is going to be a 3 camby spokesman with kids marcus camby has been named national spokesman for the league 's welcome back to school initiative which will kick off the coming school year the league was so impressed with camby 's annual march with marcus in which camby walks several hundred students to school on the first day of classes that it borrowed the idea and plans to have similar opening day events in every nba city
 the idling trains diesel engines rumble for hours at a time as many as six or seven of them and sometimes all through the night as they wait for their next run up the island the harsh thrumming of the engines is relentless and their diesel vapors waft into the air all this in montauk where the loudest noise is supposed to be the crashing surf the newly formed montauk anti pollution coalition aims to accomplish what its members say other campaigns have failed to do persuade the long island rail road to stop using the rail yard next to the montauk train station as waiting room for trains but the railroad says that turning the engines off is impractical and that there 's nowhere else to park the trains the montauk station is surrounded by hotels motels restaurants and private residences tom bogdan the chairman of the group said that the diesel engines are never turned off and there are always out of service trains idling on the side tracks 365 days and nights a year with the summer and fall being the most objectionable times it ebbs and flows because obviously there are fewer trains off season mr bogdan said however the trains that are there run all night long regardless of if it 's july or january say it is a seasonal thing it 's still important to montauk and we 're still suffering the noise and air pollution the montauk group has sent to peter kalikow chairman of the metropolitan transportation authority and a part time resident of star island in montauk a voluminous report that includes copies of correspondence a petition bearing several hundred signatures maps of the affected areas in the hamlet and even a soundtrack of the idling diesel engines on a compact disk we do not dispute the fact that the lirr provides efficient inexpensive transportation to and from montauk and the east end of long island the report states however the lirr is also the single largest source of industrial noise pollution and related anti environmental activities in this extraordinarily beautiful part of long island through continuous and unnecessary idling of its diesel engines the lirr has created a psychological and physical public nuisance the montauk group 's efforts are being supported by other organizations and individuals in the hamlet among them the concerned citizens of montauk and the town appointed montauk citizens advisory committee bill akin president of the concerned citizens group said his organization had tried for years to change the railroad 's habits at montauk we took a shot some years ago and even got the east hampton town board at the time to send a letter to the mta saying they wanted this problem resolved mr akin said the mta wrote back and said we ca n't change things because it 's easier to let the engines run than shut them down and have to start them up again hours later other than that the town ca n't do anything because it has no jurisdiction over the property mr bogdan added there has been as lot of unhappiness for a long time but the complaints were from individuals they did n't know how to organize there were plenty of complaints but no concerted effort now we 've got one janice nessel is the general manager of the montauk manor a former hotel converted into a condo with 140 suites 45 of them facing the train station guests ms nessel wrote in an aug 2 letter to the mta are outraged at the sound levels that go on throughout the night and want a refund over the course of years the loss of thousands of dollars by montauk manor can be directly attributed to the long term and overnight idling of lirr diesel engines brian dolan a long island rail road spokesman said the agency understands that there could be some inconvenience but said it can take hours to bring a diesel engine from a cold start to the correct running temperature it comes down to keeping the compressors running for air conditioning during the warmer months in addition to the time consuming process of getting engines ready to work efficiently he said mr dolan stressed that montauk residents should not feel that the lirr is ignoring their concerns where we can shut the trains down we do he said we have taken steps recently with increased staffing to help ease that we 're watching the situation we are looking at different steps we can take every year we work more with east end towns on improved service and the area is important to us russell smith the group 's attorney said he believes the decibel level emitted by the trains exceeds that allowed in the town 's noise pollution law asked how the town could enforce a law on the lirr which is exempt from town regulation he replied just because they 're the railroad does n't mean they can break any laws if a conductor hits someone that 's assault you ca n't hide behind 'i 'm the railroad what 's happening in montauk is just a different form of assault
 chris byrd does not annihilate opponents as much as he annoys them evander holyfield was just the latest victim saturday night byrd became the new international boxing federation heavyweight champion with a 12 round unanimous decision over holyfield at boardwalk hall there were no knockdowns and neither fighter was seriously hurt but that was typical of a byrd fight he pecks away with his jab he uses his speed and elusiveness to avoid trouble and he is rarely baited into toe to toe exchanges boxing to his strengths and exposing his opponent 's weaknesses is the formula that byrd 36 2 has used to take his place among the sport 's top heavyweights and at 32 he plans to be around awhile it 's time for me to move on to try to beat the best guys out there said byrd who added that he would love to fight either lennox lewis the world boxing council champion or the winner of the world boxing association championship bout in march between roy jones jr and john ruiz but in the wild world of boxing it remains to be seen whether byrd receives a crack at lewis ruiz or jones lewis watched saturday 's fight from ringside and he remained noncommittal about his next opponent byrd 's lack of punching power for a heavyweight could be a huge disadvantage against a boxer of lewis 's size while lewis regularly fights at 240 pounds or more byrd entered the ring at about 210 on saturday and his two losses have come against bigger fighters ike ibeabuchi and wladimir klitschko though his opinion is hardly unbiased emanuel steward lewis 's trainer said lewis 's power would overwhelm byrd we wo n't even use a sparring partner that 's under 220 pounds stewart said they 've got to come up with some new weight divisions chris is very good with these smaller guys but when it gets to guys like lennox who are 260 pounds and who can punch he 's not going to hold up and it 's not fair to him i wish they would have a division with a 220 pound limit if i were a boxing commissioner that 's the first thing i would do on saturday night skill was more important than size and byrd displayed plenty of boxing skill facing a fighter who was about his size byrd frustrated holyfield 38 6 2 particularly during the later rounds when holyfield 's 40 year old legs appeared to be weary holyfield said he injured his left shoulder in the first round and there was no reason to doubt him because he threw few jabs but even if holyfield had been 100 percent the outcome might not have been much different according to the judges the fight was not close steve weisfeld and eugene grant scored it 117 111 and john stewart had it 116 112 all in favor of byrd while holyfield seemed to land the heavier punches byrd threw more shots displayed more hand speed and scored enough clean punches to sway the judges as the fight progressed byrd 's confidence grew several times after slipping punches byrd stuck out his tongue at holyfield byrd was particularly impressive in rounds 6 through 9 hitting holyfield with punches that did not hurt but that dissuaded holyfield from mounting an attack byrd insists he can beat any heavyweight and saturday 's victory will make it more difficult for top contenders to ignore him he entered the ring facing a fighter with a bigger name and more experience but he left the ring holding a championship belt it feels good after a lot of years of hard work he said i 'm looking forward to some more big fights

 no matter what happens with the mets free agent pitchers this off season steve phillips has pledged not to shortchange the mets or their fans next season i think everybody can be assured phillips said that we 'll have 11 pitchers to start next season with i do n't know their names but i 'm sure we 'll find someone who wants to come play for us mike hampton rick reed and bobby jones three fifths of the starting rotation are free agents john franco and turk wendell two important elements of the team 's relief corps also became free agents after the world series franco after a philadelphia flirtation has decided to remain with the mets and some other members of that group have indicated that they too would like to stay but the mets have n't secured their continued loyalty with new contracts anywhere from one to all four of the remaining free agents are expected to go elsewhere only one team that has played in the world series has lost four pitchers as free agents in the ensuing off season after they won the world series in 1992 four pitchers left the toronto blue jays but remarkably they did n't miss a beat they won the world series the next season too three of the departed pitchers had been starters though not all for the entire season jimmy key was a regular who started 33 games but dave stieb was injured much of the season and made only 14 starts and david cone started seven times after the blue jays acquired him from the mets with five weeks left in the season the fourth free agent was tom henke the team 's closer the difference between the losses the blue jays sustained and those the mets face is that the blue jays had replacements ready and the mets do n't it amazes me when i look at our team photo of the '92 club said gord ash the toronto general manager the pitching staff was amazing we had solid starters who were pitching out of the bullpen there was a lot of depth as ash recalled it the blue jays lost key because he wanted a four year contract and the club had a policy at the time that permitted no more than three years for a pitcher the yankees gave key four years ash said the blue jays tried to sign cone and were prepared to give him close to the 18 million kansas city offered but the royals gave cone half the sum as a signing bonus stieb was allowed to leave because the blue jays felt he was n't healthy henke was a tough decision ash said but we felt duane ward was ready to take over that role pat hentgen a rookie who started two games in 1992 became a regular starter the following season dave stewart a free agent joined him in the rotation the pitching staff had another addition al leiter who had been hurt the previous season if the mets lose any of their pitchers they will have to replace them by signing other free agents or making trades they do n't have any hentgens or leiters or wards waiting in the wings you have to have plans a b and c phillips said and sometimes you run parallel negotiations and the market tells you who you keep more than two dozen free agent pitchers have left teams in the months after they played in the world series the first and perhaps most celebrated was jim catfish hunter he signed with the yankees two and a half months after he won game 3 of the 1974 world series en route to oakland 's third successive world series championship hunter 's defection the result of a breached contract occurred two years before the beginning of free agency as it is known today don gullett and doyle alexander the starting pitchers in game 1 of the 1976 world series were the first pitchers to leave their teams under that new procedure alexander left the yankees for the texas rangers gullett switched teams moving from the cincinnati reds to the yankees and started game 1 of the 1977 world series mike torrez started games 3 and 6 of that world series and won both games for the yankees a month later he signed with the boston red sox and was in position the following october to throw the memorable pitch that bucky dent hit for a home run in the red sox playoff game against the yankees after the yankees advanced to the world series against los angeles tommy john beat them in the first game six weeks later he signed with the yankees as a free agent john proceeded to give the yankees a performance that has gone unmatched by any free agent pitcher winning 21 and 22 victories in his first two seasons with them ed whitson did not experience similar success after he left san diego for the yankees following the 1984 world series whitson in fact did n't last two seasons with the yankees he was traded back to the padres in the 1986 season fleeing new york after having been completely intimidated by circumstances and fans jack morris left minnesota for toronto in 1991 and his 21 victories helped the blue jays get to the 1992 world series the four members of the toronto pitching staff who left after that series were n't the only pitchers to change teams a pair of atlanta pitchers left as free agents too jeff reardon and mike bielecki going elsewhere in an attempt to continue their fading careers the yankees let two pitchers from their 1996 world series staff leave john wetteland went to texas and jimmy key leaving a world series team a second time moved to baltimore kevin brown was the last pitcher to leave his world series team forsaking san diego for los angeles in 1998 the economic outlook appearing before a senate judiciary subcommittee last week commissioner bud selig said that 18 to 20 teams will lose money this year skeptics on the players side and in the academic sports economics field seldom believe such reports of wholesale losses but if the figures are correct the baseball economy may be improving in the report earlier this year of the commissioner 's blue ribbon panel on baseball economics a chart shows that 27 teams lost money in the previous five years based on selig 's washington report seven to nine of those teams will break even or make money this year
 steve fossett the 58 year old chicago investment executive whose six year quest to circumnavigate the world in a balloon ended five times in frustration succeeded yesterday on his sixth attempt he became the first person to fly around the planet nonstop and alone without a motor floating 27000 feet over the indian ocean near the southwestern tip of australia mr fossett crossed his starting longitude of 117 degrees east at 9 38 pm local time 9 38 am eastern time after 13 1 2 days in the air mr fossett and his balloon the spirit of freedom had taken off on june 18 from the town of northam directly to the north in far western australia his journey covered more than 19400 miles all in the southern hemisphere it 's enormous relief and satisfaction mr fossett said via a satellite phone to a news conference at his control center in st louis mr fossett said he had a few bottles of beer with him but i 'll be saving that for the landing because there 's no one to drink it with here after crossing the finish line mr fossett steered his balloon toward winds that would carry him to the northeast he is expected to land in southern australia at dusk today mr fossett 's balloon flight is the second to circumnavigate the globe but the first to be accomplished solo a flight in march 1999 with dr bertrand piccard of switzerland and brian jones of england as the pilots was the first around the world balloon trip landing in egypt after flying for 19 days and more than 29000 miles over china the pacific ocean and the united states mr fossett 's trip was shorter in distance and duration but still qualified as circling the world according to the rules set by the international aeronautic federation in switzerland to meet the federation 's definition mr fossett had to fly at least 12400 miles and to remain outside an imaginary circle 4143 miles in diameter drawn around the south pole circling the earth at the equator is a distance of 24900 miles based on the information we have so far we believe he will be able to successfully claim some records said thierry montigneaux the federation 's assistant secretary general mr fossett 's trip was much more arduous than dr piccard 's and mr jones 's who were able to switch off piloting duties so that each could sleep part of the time during his flight mr fossett slept only about four hours a day usually naps of 45 minutes or less when he allowed the balloon to be guided by autopilot the traveling accommodations aboard the spirit of freedom were much more spartan lacking for instance air his capsule 7 feet long 5 feet wide and 5 feet tall was unpressurized requiring him to wear an oxygen mask during almost all of the trip he also had to climb outside into subzero temperatures to change fuel tanks and repair burners mr fossett who swam the english channel in 1985 and raced an iditarod dog sled in 1992 took on the challenges of ballooning in the mid 1990 's several of his earlier attempts which began in 1996 ended in near disaster in 1998 a thunderstorm sucked him down ruptured the balloon and slammed him into the south pacific he swam out of the gondola on fire and already under water and was rescued a few hours later experience from his earlier flights improvements in the balloon design and more accurate weather forecasting helped limit problems during this flight and also a bit of luck said david perlman a shift supervisor at mission control we 're still waiting for him to land that 's why we have n't really begun our celebrations yet on june 23 off chile mr fossett lowered the balloon to just 900 feet above the pacific ocean to slow down and avoid the path of a storm ahead a sudden rain squall knocked him down 500 more feet or just 400 feet above the water that was probably the most dangerous situation of the trip mr perlman said he was going to go fishing but he decided not to when a valve on the burner became stuck open he used the chemical heating pack from one of his militarylike food packs to defrost it mr perlman said but for most of the flight the weather was in his favor over south africa the jet stream winds whisked him along at 200 miles an hour alan noble project director for cameron balloons of bristol england which built the spirit of freedom as well as mr fossett 's earlier balloons said he carried his cellphone in case he needed to be consulted on any mechanical problems this time it did n't ring once he said i think it 's a good indication of how everything went like other long distance balloons the billowing envelope of the 180 foot high spirit of freedom consists of two compartments one containing 550000 cubic feet of helium which provided most of the lift and one containing 100000 cubic feet of air one of the design improvements was better insulation between the two layers of material the battle we have is preventing the sun from heating the balloon during the day and the reverse battle at night mr noble said for his next feat mr fossett said during the news conference he would like to fly a glider to the stratosphere 60000 feet above the ground

 most states allow companies tax credits to offset part of the cost of helping their employees pay for child care but few companies take advantage of these credits by providing such benefits a new study shows in a report to be published on tuesday the national women 's law center said it had studied 20 states in which data about child care credits were readily available in five of these states no companies applied for the credit in 11 others fewer than five companies did so even in the states where more companies took the credit the number was only a minuscule fraction of the total number of corporations there only 164 in california 21 in oregon 20 in connecticut and 8 in ohio new york and new jersey do not have corporate tax credits for child care beginning with 2002 taxes companies can also claim a federal income tax credit for having a child care center or subsidizing their workers child care expenses but the law center a nonprofit organization that works to advance the legal rights of women speculated that given the history of the state programs not many companies would use it one author of the study nancy duff campbell co president of the law center said parents would be better served if the tax breaks were eliminated and the money was used to subsidize families directly deron zeppelin director of governmental affairs for the association of human resource professionals said the main reason companies did not apply for the credit was that they did not know about it governments mr zeppelin said do a poor job of advertising benefits like this and most companies do not have sophisticated professionals who pay attention to such matters the cost of child care is an increasing burden for many families the children 's defense fund estimates that the average cost for a 4 year old in an urban area is 4000 to 6000 a year and that the cost for an infant is 1100 more the tax credits were pushed by politicians who wanted to help families meet those costs but did not want to spend money directly the federal tax credit for employers enacted as part of the big tax cut bill last year is expected to cost 48 million in lost revenue in the current fiscal year and more than 100 million annually in subsequent years total state spending for the credits is less than 6 million a year
 the gap between rich and poor more than doubled from 1979 to 2000 an analysis of government data shows the gulf is such that the richest 1 percent of americans in 2000 had more money to spend after taxes than the bottom 40 percent in 1979 the wealthiest 1 percent had just under half the after tax income of the poorest 40 percent of americans analysis of new data from the congressional budget office shows the figures show 2000 as the year of the greatest economic disparity between rich and poor for any year since 1979 the year the budget office began collecting this data according to the center for budget and policy priorities a nonprofit research organization in washington that advocates tax and federal spending policies to benefit the poor it released its analysis on tuesday the richest 28 million americans had 950 billion after taxes or 155 percent of the 62 trillion economic pie in 2000 isaac shapiro a senior fellow at the center said the poorest 110 million americans had less sharing 144 percent of all after tax money but the higher incomes of the last decade did not lift all people equally in 2000 the top 1 percent of american taxpayers had 862700 each after taxes on average more than triple the 286300 they had adjusted for inflation in 1979 the bottom 40 percent in 2000 had 21118 each up 13 percent from their 18695 average in 1979 mr shapiro also analyzed the budget office data in tandem with a recently updated study on income by the national bureau of economic research a nonpartisan nonprofit research organization in cambridge mass the bureau study found that in 2000 the top 1 percent income group had the largest share of before tax income for any year since 1929 mr shapiro said that findings from both studies suggested that in 2000 the top 1 percent had the largest share of the nation 's total after tax income since at least 1936 and probably since 1929 mr shapiro emphasized that his combined analysis accounted for the fact that his study used after tax incomes while the bureau 's study used pretax incomes both low  and middle income people shared in the boom of the 1990 's while in the 1980 's the bottom fifth experienced a decline in after tax income according to the budget office data analyzed by mr shapiro and robert greenstein director for the center on budget and policy priorities the middle fifth had an average after tax income of 41900 in 2000 a rise of 15 percent both since 1979 and 1997 indicating a long period of no real economic gains for this group you do have gains across the spectrum from 1997 to 2000 mr shapiro said but they are much more dramatic at the top the center 's analysis said the highest income americans had grown richer from 1979 to 2000 both from gains in income because of economic prosperity and from tax cuts huge gains in executive pay were a significant factor mr shapiro said federal tax burdens for most americans had declined over the previous two decades and not risen as some conservative policy experts have asserted the center said congress enacted tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 that were heavily weighted to the top 1 percent which supporters said would encourage them to invest more to the benefit of all americans from 1979 to 2000 the total federal tax burden for the top 1 percent dropped 38 percentage points but for the middle fifth the decline was only 19 percentage points tax rates for the poorest fifth declined 16 percentage points the top 1 percent pay a quarter of all federal taxes while the bottom 40 percent pay 6 percent of all federal taxes
 the bush administration proposed new wage and hour regulations yesterday that it said would increase the number of low wage workers who qualify for overtime pay but cut the number of higher paid white collar workers who qualify labor department officials estimated that the proposals which face a 90 day comment and review period would add 13 million low paid workers to the group that automatically qualifies for overtime pay the rules they said would exempt an additional 640000 executive administrative and professional workers from qualifying when they work more than 40 hours a week the proposed regulations would alter the criteria for determining which white collar employees can not receive overtime and would make it considerably harder for workers earning more than 65000 a year to qualify for overtime under the existing regulations which have not been updated since 1975 assistant managers of fast food restaurants earning 18000 a year often do not qualify for overtime because they are considered managers under the new rules anyone earning less than 22100 a year would automatically qualify for overtime a significant change from the existing rules under which only workers earning less than 8060 a year automatically qualify for overtime reform of these regulations is absolutely necessary in order to strengthen overtime protection for low wage workers said tammy d mccutchen administrator of the wage and hour division at the labor department department officials said 248 percent of the additional workers who would automatically qualify for overtime under the new rules are hispanic and 547 percent are women bush administration officials said the proposals sought to simplify and modernize regulations under the fair labor standards act of 1938 business groups generally praised the proposed regulations while labor unions harshly criticized them saying they would help employers by exempting large groups of white collar workers from receiving time and a half for overtime union leaders applauded the expanded overtime coverage for low wage workers but predicted that the additional white collar workers exempted from overtime would far exceed the 640000 predicted by the labor department it 's an absolute disaster for white collar workers who deserve protection under these regulations said nick clark senior assistant general counsel with the united food and commercial workers union it 's going to gut protections for many workers in the military airlines energy financial securities and health care industries under current regulations about 70 million workers qualify for overtime because of automatic provisions or because their jobs are not considered exempt executive administrative or professional ones traditionally workers who are considered managers high level administrators or highly skilled professionals have been exempted from overtime coverage to determine whether an administrative employee is exempt from overtime the labor department 's proposal drops the longtime test of whether the worker customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent judgment instead the test would become whether the worker holds a position of responsibility defined as performing work of substantial importance or performing work requiring a high level of skill or training like the existing test the proposed test for administrative workers would also weigh whether their primary duty is to perform office or nonmanual work directly related to the management or general business operations of their employer under the new proposals an executive employee would be exempt if three criteria were met the worker 's primary duty is the management of the enterprise or a department or subdivision the worker regularly directs the work of two or more other employees and the employee has the authority to hire or fire or recommend hiring and firing other employees under the old rules executive employees were exempt if they met those three criteria and two others if they met the test of using discretionary powers and if they did not devote more than 20 percent of their time or 40 percent in retail and service establishments to activities not closely related to exempt work if a nonmanual worker earns more than 65000 a year however only one of the criteria under the new rules must be met union leaders said the revised criteria would make it far too easy for companies to exempt higher paid employees for professional employees the proposed test is whether the worker 's primary duty requires advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction under the existing rules that instruction generally meant college or graduate school but the proposed rules say it could also include military duty technical schools or work experience randel k johnson vice president for labor policy at the united states chamber of commerce said the proposed regulations 13000 words down from the existing 31000 should help slow the flood of class action lawsuits in which many higher paid workers assert that they were wrongly denied overtime we think they 're on the right track simplifying some of these tests mr johnson said we 're encouraged by the fact that they set an upper level salary test with a simplified duties test ms mccutchen said the proposed regulations would not affect workers who qualify for overtime under union contracts

 the red sun was falling the cooking fires were burning and the village elder 's naked shoulders were shivering in the afternoon cool as he described the eagerly awaited arrival of the new year when the thunderstorms start and the leaves grow from the ground that 's how we know it 's the new year said maverihepisa koruhama wrinkling his brow as he tried to calculate the auspicious date this time he said finally the new year came about one month ago here in this tiny village of mud huts and wildflowers in the craggy arid hills of northwest namibia there are no calendars no electricity and no words in the native language for millennium computer or y2k a telephone is a three hour drive away as the modern world celebrated the coming of 2000 with confetti and champagne the himba people started and ended their day much as they have for nearly 300 years whistling to their goats milking their cows and sleeping with the sun these nomadic shepherds in this remote corner of the world stand as living links between the old world and the new walking proudly with their age old traditions into the new century they measure time by the shifting sun and mark the coming of the new year with the arrival of seasonal rains that transform the parched red soil here into a carpet of green in their herero language the word for day is the same as the word for sun and the word for year means rain mr koruhama said his family had never heard of the year 2000 or the year 1999 for that matter because the himba do not use numbers to count years but he watched proudly today as his young sons chased wayward cattle and his three wives soured milk for butter as their ancestors did when they came to this region centuries ago from what is now angola today is a day like any other said mr koruhama amused by a foreign visitor 's questions my father and my grandfathers they were surviving from goats and cattle that is what i am doing today and i am teaching my children to look after cattle that is our way that is our future but the challenges confronting the estimated 7000 to 10000 himba who hope to carry the old ways into the future are great already the modern world is beginning to touch isolated villages like this one in kaokoland where the huts in the hills are accessible only on foot or in vehicles with four wheel drive the himba have begun to send some of their children far away to school and some come home wearing reebok baseball caps along with their traditional loincloths in some places shepherds trade goats for bright yellow tarpaulins to protect their mud roofs from leaks some himba have left their villages altogether turning their backs on the ways of their community where bare breasted women still stain their skin with glossy red ochre and men still cover their long hair in turban like wraps some of my extended family they 've left and gone to the towns said kamukazona koruhama mr koruhama 's sister in law they change the way they dress the way they look she said sadly they do n't come back it 's many many himba people living now in towns people are asking 'why do they leave why do they move to the place that belongs to other people why do n't they come back for the family of mr koruhama it is difficult to understand they can not understand the appeal of the western way of life people in town often forget the old ways they warn their children will they remember that the boiled root of the sour plum tree cures diarrhea their parents ask or that the mopane tree makes the best firewood or that one can not communicate with the ancestors without the sacred fire that burns in every village move to town repeated mr koruhama scoffing at the idea that his children might someday leave his village that does n't make any sense goats are afraid of cars how will the goats live in town with all the cars down there but change is coming the namibian government is determined to develop their remote region starting with a 550 million dam on the border with angola that would flood the grazing grounds of 1000 people and 100 ancestral graves while providing the country with much needed power the project still in the planning stages would bring thousands of workers to kaoakoland and with them the benefits of electricity roads and clinics as well as the problems of prostitution and aids government officials acknowledge that is the only region in namibia that is completely in darkness no roads no infrastructure nothing said paulinus shilamba director of energy for the ministry of mines and energy here this project will change the whole face of that region mr shilamba said the present culture of the himba people will gradually disappear the himba will change they will get cars get jobs and go to school like everyone else in my mind that 's better advocates for the himba are battling the plan saying it would irreparably damage what is regarded as one of southern africa 's most successful self sufficient tribes but zepauandoui tjambiru koruhama another of mr koruhama 's sisters in law who lives nearby believe some change is good she is a traditional wife she covers her body with ochre and butterfat every morning and prays to her ancestors she wears a conch shell around her neck and calf skins to cover her hips she knows her year of birth by its proper name based on its most significant event i was born in the year of my great grandfather 's death she said she has never heard of new york or america and has no idea who won this country 's presidential election which was held last month she has eight children and many more cows to manage her life is full but it is also very hard and she does not romanticize it during the dry season when water is scarce her family moves as many as 10 times searching for grass for the cattle to eat even during the rainy season the soil is often too dry to grow corn or other vegetables and her family must often subsist on milk these are hard ways the same hard ways of my grandmothers she said so she and her husband decided to compromise one son would tend the sheep in the traditional fashion another boy would go to school to learn english and modern ways and every year now her husband trades three goats to cover the annual school fees this week the boy aaron was at home from school on break wearing an adidas jacket and faded puma sneakers he is about 17 most himba do not know their exact ages and he knows all about the millennium in 2000 he says he hopes to get a job buy a car help his family he says he will make his life in a city somewhere not here i want to get money to help my mother and father to buy food to buy blankets for them he said his mother listens to him quietly and then sends him off to tend the cattle she prays he will work for a while and then return home to his traditions he says now these new ways are so beautiful but i hope someday he will realize it 's not the best way she said sighing but i ca n't see the future only the ancestors know what the new rains will bring

 with oil prices surging to their highest level in a decade energy secretary bill richardson called on oil exporting nations today to increase their production my hope is that opec seriously considers increasing production mr richardson said referring to the 11 member organization of petroleum exporting countries as crude oil prices rose to 3490 a barrel in new york today the highest level since the 1990 military buildup before the persian gulf war mr richardson said that energy costs were unacceptably high american officials voiced concerns that home heating oil prices this winter could be 30 percent more than they were last year in remarks to reporters mr richardson said opec should increase production enough to reduce prices to 20 to 25 a barrel or risk further disrupting the world economy opec ministers are scheduled to meet in vienna on sunday world markets are very clearly insisting that there 's not enough oil on the market to bring stability mr richardson said the clinton administration is under increasing pressure to do something about oil prices the white house has prepared a contingency plan to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve although it has not yet acceded to demands from some lawmakers to do so on a trip in february to the middle east mr richardson secured a promise from saudi arabia to raise its output the saudi oil minister reported today that his nation had increased production by an additional 600000 barrels a day since july a 7 percent increase american officials have so far declined to say exactly how much additional production they are seeking from opec nations
 four weeks ago shortly after ohio state convened for training camp craig krenzel rolled his eyes when he was asked whether it was true that the buckeyes intended to open up their offense this season as they tried to defend their national title krenzel a senior quarterback is a smart guy in fact he is an academic all american majoring in molecular genetics no he explained with a wry smile the buckeyes are a running team and adding more sweeps might be as adventuresome as they would get krenzel is apparently a pretty good poker player too because tonight the no 2 buckeyes walloped no 17 washington 28 9 by throwing over under and around the huskies in a performance that would have been right at home in the huskies own pass happy pacific 10 conference ohio state did it without its suspended star running back maurice clarett by halftime krenzel 's 18 passes were more than he attempted in seven of his games last season as the buckeyes went up by 14 0 his final numbers tonight 15 of 27 for 203 yards were his finest since a 204 yard performance against wisconsin in the eighth game last season while ringing up a 16 1 record as a starter and leading the buckeyes to a nation 's best 15 game winning streak krenzel has eclipsed 200 yards passing on only two other occasions still it was the passes krenzel chose not to throw that were the most meaningful tonight he tucked the ball under his arm and motored his 6 foot 4 225 pound frame around the corners for touchdown runs of 23 and 11 yards this year we have so many more weapons offensively and the key is going to be spreading the ball around krenzel said we 'll only be good if we get different guys the ball ohio state coach jim tressel had indicated early in the preseason that the emphasis on the pass had to do more with krenzel 's intelligence and strong arm than it did with clarett 's absence clarett a sophomore is serving a multigame suspension while the ncaa investigates an exaggerated police report that clarett filed in april after a car he had been loaned was broken into as well as charges that he received unusual academic aid the buckeyes impressive passing game did not exactly have the crowd of 105078 at ohio stadium the third largest in stadium history forgetting woody hayes 's 3 yards and a cloud of dust attack clarett 's replacements the juniors maurice hall and lydell ross combined for 101 yards and each scored a touchdown nor could anyone have forgotten clarett who set a record for ohio state freshmen last season by rushing for 1237 yards and was visible on the sideline in a bright red sweat suit we 've got to get a lot better running the football and we will tressel said this is week 1 i wanted to see us run for 200 and throw for 250 we did neither but we 'll get better but the buckeye faithful had to be heartened by krenzel 's command of a team that returned 18 starters who were seasoned enough to win seven games last season by 7 points or fewer the entire offense is back including the playmaking receivers michael jenkins and drew carter ohio state 's swarming hard hitting defense led end simon fraser 's seven tackles corralled what was supposed to be a high octane washington offense last season washington quarterback cody pickett threw for a pac 10 record 4458 yards and his favorite receiver reggie williams led the conference with 94 catches and 1454 yards but the ohio state defense covered the entire field pickett rarely had time to plant his feet and often launched his throws in desperation he was 26 of 49 for 255 yards while williams battled through an athletic secondary led by cornerback chris gamble and managed to grab 10 catches for 107 yards krenzel 's 23 yard run came with 2 minutes 51 seconds left in the first quarter and gave ohio state a 14 0 lead with 11 seconds left in the half his second touchdown made it 21 0 it was a painful and unforgettable debut for coach keith gilbertson he took over for rick neuheisel as washington 's coach after neuheisel was fired in june for gambling in an ncaa basketball pool and then lying to university officials about it they 're as good as advertised gilbertson said their front four puts on tremendous pressure their defensive backs are everywhere they 're going to win a lot of games while krenzel may have been less than forthcoming last month about ohio state 's passing intentions he was an emphatic that with or without clarett the buckeyes were well equipped to repeat their championship feat in between sessions of leukemia research at the ohio state medical center he led his teammates on voluntary summer drills and liked what he saw he still does it 's going to be a challenge to get better every week krenzel said last year 's team was able to do it i think these guys can

 bobby holik who has missed eight consecutive games with a strained hip flexor went through a full practice today and expressed optimism that he could return to the rangers lineup against the calgary flames on thursday night but holik the rangers key free agent acquisition last summer expressed a major caveat regarding his injured hip i do n't think it will be what it was before until the summer that is it will not be fully healed until he can give it a full summer of rest that is not good news for the rangers who lured holik 31 across the hudson river after a decade with the devils with a five year 45 million contract right now i 've got to get to the point where it 's not going to get any worse by playing said holik who has long been regarded by many as the best two way center in the nhl but i do n't think this will completely go away this season i 'm looking to get to the point where i wo n't feel worse some days it might be worse than others i want to get it to where i wo n't feel restricted by it the rangers 7 9 2 0 have won three of four games since ending a three game losing streak against calgary 5 5 3 3 they will be without coach bryan trottier who will sit out the final game of a two game suspension holik 's injury stems from the last preseason game on oct 5 holik nearly broke his right foot when he was hit by a slap shot as he was going to the net x rays were negative holik said today he began to feel his lower back troubling him during the season opener at carolina on oct 9 i tried to play through it said holik who added that he began to favor his right foot when he skated which led to the hip problem you overcompensate for it and eventually you get to the point where you strain it in 10 games holik has one goal and one assist and an uncharacteristic plus minus rating of minus 4 what holik wants now is to get back to the point where he feels he can play without hurting the team that is looking more like thursday night i do n't think i 'm at the stage in my career where i can play eight minutes and be effective holik said holik was encouraged that he was able to go through a full practice this afternoon two days after he participated in the morning skate in san jose calif i thought i had a good practice said holik who filled in on a line with rem murray and pavel bure in eric lindros 's usual spot lindros had stayed at the team hotel because of the flu the rangers said i 'm close to playing holik said but if i feel i 'm not quite ready i do n't want to take the spot of somebody who is 100 percent with almost 80 percent of their season ahead of them however the rangers have to be worried that holik does not think he will be 100 percent until next season
 a small biotechnology company is expected to announce today that it has determined the three dimensional structure of a crucial enzyme in the virus that causes sars an accomplishment that could accelerate efforts to develop treatments for the deadly respiratory disease the company structural genomix of san diego said yesterday it had unraveled the shape of the sars protease an enzyme that plays an essential role in replication of the virus and is a prime target for scientists trying to disable it knowing that shape should make it easier to design drugs that mesh with the enzyme like a key in a lock and block it from working you can see what you 're doing said timothy j r harris chief executive of structural genomix which is privately held a similar technique was used to develop the protease inhibitors that have had a significant effect in treating hiv infection structural genomix has put the structure in the protein data bank a publicly accessible database allowing all researchers to study it but the company has also filed for a patent on the structure dr harris said he said that he did not intend to stop academic research but that companies wanting to use the structure to develop drugs might have to negotiate with structural genomix providing the patent is granted we hope that they will come to us and say 'you 've got the structure why do n't we work together he said how valuable the patent will be depends to some extent on whether sars which has killed more than 800 people and sickened more than 8000 becomes a serious recurring problem or continues to die out scientists have already developed computer approximations of what the sars enzyme would look like based on the equivalent enzymes in viruses somewhat similar to sars but dr harris said the actual structure differs from the models and would be better for drug discovery structural genomix specializes in rapidly determining the three dimensional structures of proteins by bouncing x rays off a crystal of the protein and inferring the shape from how the x rays scatter this process called x ray crystallography used to take months or years if it could be done at all but new technology has reduced the time needed to weeks dr harris said it took eight weeks to determine the protease structure but half that time was taken in obtaining the dna for the viral proteins from collaborators at the genome institute of singapore and getting it through customs an article in the july 18 science magazine quotes a scientist in beijing who claims to have determined the structure of the sars protease but structural genomix appears to be the first to make its structure public
 sammy sosa of the cubs leads jeromy burnitz of the mets in career home runs 497 207 so some of the 36772 fans last night at shea stadium might have been more interested in watching sosa but burnitz got the better of their derby although they each hit one out burnitz hit his with the score tied in the bottom of the ninth and a man on base to give the mets a 3 1 victory it was his 19th home run of the season and 7th in 14 games acquired in the off season from milwaukee in a three way trade burnitz has had a substandard season as have the mets but a game winning home run is still something to celebrate for a mets team trying to escape last place in the national league east it 's the big leagues and when you 've just hit a game winning homer it 's a good feeling burnitz said after lofting juan cruz 's 3 2 changeup over the right field fence it gets even better when your teammates beat the heck out of you at home plate that 's a fun thing to experience sosa 33 nearing season and career milestones hit his home run in the fourth off mets starter al leiter who went eight and a third innings gave up four hits and struck out eight david weathers 6 3 got the victory in relief it was the first appearance here this season for the cubs sosa is 3 home runs short of 500 and 7 behind eddie murray who is 17th on the career list with 504 this season sosa has passed lou gehrig and six others besides leading the national league with 47 homers this season sosa is 3 short of hitting 50 for the fifth consecutive season no player in major league history has reached that mark that many times babe ruth and mark mcgwire each did it four times before the game sosa spoke about visiting new york and how much he enjoyed playing here his first major league game was in this city in 1989 when he was a rookie with the texas rangers and they played the yankees no question about it new york is one of the places that 's like my second home said sosa who is from the dominican republic so many dominicans here and so many people who love baseball here many athletes of sosa 's stature play at least part of their career with new york teams so would he be interested in a change of address sosa smiled and replied if that moment comes no question i would never hesitate to come here and play i 've been having so much support here but right now i 'm still a chicago cub i do n't know what 's going to happen he is signed through 2005 with a club option for 2006 in recent days sosa has expressed dissatisfaction with the continuing poor fortunes of the north siders this is not the time to celebrate he said after surpassing 100 runs batted in last weekend to join mel ott and willie mays as the only national leaguers to reach or exceed that total for eight consecutive seasons this has been a really tough year i 've worked so hard it would have been better if we were in a pennant race sosa has also urged cubs management to make changes to clean up the mess on his fifth place team because i do n't want to be in the same kind of september next year in sosa 's first trip to the plate in the first inning he was safe at first on an error when third baseman edgardo alfonzo missed his ground ball on his second trip leading off the fourth he swung at leiter 's first pitch it was high and it stayed high soaring into the night sky a white dot that landed over the left field fence in the bullpen an estimated 455 feet from home plate many fans cheered his third trip came with one out and nobody on in the sixth leiter walked him on four pitches drawing boos from the fans who wanted to see sosa swing the bat in his fourth at bat leading off the ninth with the score at 1 1 sosa fouled out to the catcher on the first pitch inside pitch now that fred wilpon has taken full ownership of the mets changes have begun yesterday 's announcement was that an office of the chairman had been created with wilpon as chairman and chief executive wilpon 's longtime partner saul katz will be president and jeff wilpon fred wilpon 's son will be executive vice president and chief operating officer jeff wilpon was principally responsible for the creation and operation of the brooklyn cyclones franchise including overseeing the building of keyspan park as well as the development of the team mike piazza was named national league player of the week for sept 9 15 he hit four home runs and batted 458
 you know what they say about a little knowledge here 's some the greatest sprinters and basketball players are predominantly black here 's some more nobel laureates in science are predominantly white what do we conclude that blacks have natural running ability and whites have natural science ability or perhaps that blacks have natural running ability but whites do n't have natural science ability because that would be politically incorrect or perhaps that we can draw no valid conclusions about the racial distribution of abilities on the basis of data like these that is what modern anthropology would say but it 's not what a new book taboo why black athletes dominate sports and why we 're afraid to talk about it says it says that blacks dominate sports because of their genes and that we 're afraid to talk about it on account of a cabal of high ranking politically correct postmodern professors myself i am flattered to observe among them the book is a piece of good old fashioned american anti intellectualism those dang perfessers that plays to vulgar beliefs about group differences of the sort we recall from the bell curve six years ago these are not however issues that anthropologists are afraid to talk about we talk about them a lot the author journalist and former television producer jon entine simply does n't like what we 're saying but to approach the subject with any degree of rigor as anthropologists have been trying to do for nearly a century requires recognizing that it consists of several related questions first how can we infer a genetic basis for differences among people the answer collect genetic data there 's no substitute we could document consistent differences in physical features acts and accomplishments until the second coming and be entirely wrong in thinking they 're genetically based a thousand nigerian ibos and a thousand danes will consistently be found to differ in complexion language and head shape the first is genetic the second is n't and the third we simply do n't understand what 's clear is that developmentally the body is sufficiently plastic that subtle differences in the conditions of growth and life can affect it profoundly simple observation of difference is thus not a genetic argument which brings us to the second question how can we accept a genetic basis for athletic ability and reject it for intelligence the answer we ca n't both conclusions are based on the same standard of evidence if we accept that blacks are genetically endowed jumpers because they jump so well we are obliged to accept that they are genetically unendowed at schoolwork because they do so poorly in either case we are faced with the scientifically impossible task of drawing conclusions from a mass of poorly controlled data controls are crucial in science if every black schoolboy in america knows he 's supposed to be good at basketball and bad at algebra and we have no way to measure schoolboys outside the boundaries of such an expectation how can we gauge their natural endowments lots of things go into the observation of excellence or failure only one of which is genetic endowment but obviously humans differ thus the last question what 's the relationship between patterns of human genetic variation and groups of people the answer it 's complex all populations are heterogeneous and are built in some sense in opposition to other groups jew or muslim hutu or tutsi serb or bosnian irish or english harvard or yale one thing we 're certain of is that the groups of most significance to us do n't correspond to much in nature consider then the category black athlete and let 's limit ourselves to men here it 's broad enough to encompass arthur ashe mike tyson and kobe bryant when you read about the body of the black male athlete whose body do you imagine whatever physical gift these men share is not immediately apparent from looking at them black men of highly diverse builds enter athletics and excel far more do n't excel in other words there is a lot more to being black and to being a prominent athlete than mere biology if professional excellence or over representation could be regarded as evidence for genetic superiority there would be strong implications for jewish comedy genes and irish policeman genes inferring a group 's excellence from the achievements of some members hangs on a crucial asymmetry to accomplish something means that you had the ability to do it but the failure to do it does n't mean you did n't have the ability and the existing genetic data testify that known dna variations do not respect the boundaries of human groups to be an elite athlete or elite anybody presumably does require some kind of genetic gift but those gifts must be immensely diverse distributed broadly across the people of the world at least to judge from the way that the erosion of social barriers consistently permits talent to manifest itself in different groups of people in an interview with the philadelphia daily news in february mr entine observed that jews are overrepresented among critics of the views he espouses but is that a significantly jewish thing or is it simply a consequence of the fact that among any group of american intellectuals you 'll find jews overrepresented because they are a well educated minority there 's certainly no shortage of non jews who find the ideas in taboo to be demagogic quackery of course jewish academics may sometimes be speaking as academics not as jews likewise black athletes may perform as athletes not just as embodied blackness how easy it is to subvert michael jordan the exceptional and extraordinary man into merely the representative of the black athlete the problem with talking about the innate superiority of the black athlete is that it is make believe genetics applied to naively conceptualized groups of people it places a spotlight on imaginary natural differences that properly belongs on real social differences more important it undermines the achievements of individuals as individuals whatever gifts we each have are far more likely from what we know of genetics to be unique individual constellations of genes than to be expressions of group endowments jonathan marks teaches biological anthropology at the university of california berkeley and is author of human biodiversity
 after spending a day trying to talk their way out of a controversy the rangers found it far more effective to play their way out of it coach bryan trottier had been desperately trying to explain away a rift with center eric lindros going so far as to suggest that he was doing lindros a favor by benching him on sunday but nothing quite washed away the spat like a 5 2 victory over the edmonton oilers last night at madison square garden the crowd booed lindros lightly during introductions and finished the night raucously celebrating a rare offensive outburst by the rangers offense can cure a lot of ills a lot of ailments said mark messier who had an assist and a goal his seventh goal of the season matching last season 's total one of the things we never really anticipated was having a problem with our offense a quick two goal lead pushed that problem to the background and the victory turned the lindros situation into a footnote at least for a night all of it was a welcome break after three straight losses after the victory the rangers were 5 8 2 0 but dominating edmonton reinforced their notion that they had been playing better than recent scores indicated and it relieved a lot of pressure on lindros and trottier whose differences resulted in lindros 's extended benching sunday against st louis and in monday 's much publicized scrimmage in which trottier played on a line with lindros in a let bygones be bygones gesture by yesterday 's skate trottier was saying he had benched lindros in part to relieve the pressure building on his star i never had any doubts about eric trottier said he 's a great athlete and an important player on this team but last night 's on ice turnaround had little to do with lindros it was crafted by the unlikely scoring line of petr nedved radek dvorak and ronald petrovicky who combined for two goals and four assists the rangers were helped by a leaky performance in goal by tommy salo who was pulled after two periods in its first three shifts nedved 's line gave the rangers a 2 0 lead on goals by nedved and dvorak the first came on a nifty give and go by petrovicky and nedved 3 minutes 4 seconds into the game dvorak 's goal came five minutes later on a pass from dale purinton the players landed on a line together because trottier has been scrambling them looking for an offensive spark lindros 's final line was one assist on messier 's power play goal in the second period and 20 28 of ice time more than any other rangers forward he also took another third period penalty which was not quite so glaring thanks to the 5 2 score at the time we went back to basics lindros said we got the puck cycling out there i felt good out there hidden in all that offense was a solid defensive effort the key moments of the game may have come during a five on three power play by the oilers midway through the first period trailing by 2 0 edmonton drew a tripping penalty on petrovicky and called for a measurement of nedved 's stick which was ruled illegal the oilers though could not convert despite six shots on rangers goalie mike richter that was important rangers forward rem murray said they get right back in the game if they make it 2 1 that gave us a big lift going forward the oilers have not started the season well falling to 3 5 3 1 and salo had a nightmarish game he gave up a breakaway goal to mikael samuelsson and a crushing goal to murray with one second left in the second period it looks like we got surprised in our end too much edmonton coach craig mactavish said five goals by the rangers was a surprise all around slap shots forwards dixon ward and ted donato played their first game since being called up from hartford in place of defensemen jamie lundmark and rico fata who were sent down monday rangers defenseman tom poti traded from edmonton for mike york last season played against his former team for the first time he had two assists york had one assist

 wells fargo company said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the first security corporation for 29 billion in stock less than two weeks after the collapse of first security 's planned merger with zions bancorporation the deal will enable wells fargo the nation 's seventh largest banking company to build its presence in utah one of the fastest growing states in the west first security is based in salt lake city under the terms of the deal wells fargo based in san francisco will pay 0355 share for each share of first security based on friday 's closing stock prices the deal values first security at 1411 a share a 158 percent premium shares of first security gained 11875 yesterday to 13375 while wells fargo slipped 25 cents to 3950 on april 1 first security announced that its 10 month attempt to merge with zions also based in salt lake city had fallen through zions shareholders rejected the deal largely because first security 's stock price had fallen sharply since june with much of the decline coming after the company issued an earnings warning in march that all stock deal was valued at 59 billion when it was announced in june 1999 but had declined to about 38 billion as first security 's shares dropped in the wake of the terminated zions deal first security had few viable options said sean ryan of the research firm byrne ryan the bank 's final conference call with zions arguably the most wanton act of self immolation since the buddhist monks that protested the vietnam war decimated management 's credibility and likely scared off most plausible suitors on that march 3 conference call the banks sought to update shareholders on the status of the merger in light of first security 's first quarter earnings warning announced that day but the presence of a lawyer representing zions on the call bewildered many analysts and shareholders alike mr ryan said by periodically not allowing zions management to answer questions that day first security stock dropped 38 percent while zions fell 25 percent over the last year wells fargo has acquired several small banks with 1 billion to 2 billion in assets this is a bit of a break for wells fargo but it 's just a function of them being opportunistic mr ryan said they are able to get this cratered franchise on the cheap first security had 23 billion in assets at the end of last year and has 333 branches 138 in utah and 9600 employees it operates similar to a savings institution with a business that is generally weighted toward low return products like mortgage and car loans the mortgage business has gotten really crushed in this rate environment mr ryan said but wells fargo is one of the top operators in the mortgage business and is well positioned to resuscitate first security the combined company would have assets of about 241 billion and would have operations in 23 states the transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of the year and wells fargo said the deal should add to earnings in the second year of operations the company will take a charge of about 375 million for the merger and integration first security expects to take charges for the zions merger cancellation when its first quarter earnings are announced on april 19 to satisfy federal regulators the two banks will sell about 12 billion worth of deposits and associated loans first security has also granted wells fargo an option to purchase authorized but unissued shares of first security common stock equal to 199 percent of first security 's 206 million shares outstanding spencer eccles chairman and chief executive of first security will likely be elected to the wells fargo board the banks said

 it is called minor league but the manager quotes casey stengel from memory it is called minor league but the manager behaves like gil hodges from memory it is called minor league but most of the seats are sculptured and there are gift shops and luxury boxes for goodness sake in truth bud harrelson has more in common with joan payson than his early managers the rather jolly first owner of the mets never put on a uniform and tried to manage but here is bud harrelson a major investor in a new team called the long island ducks hitting fungoes and coaching third base and recruiting players and even giving calm hodges like counsel to an umpire harrelson has put up his own money to be part of either a fad or a resurgence of minor league baseball he is not only wearing his old no 3 but he is also the president of the independent atlantic league with eight teams including the ducks who are based in central islip ny exactly 42 miles from my house notes harrelson who considers himself a homebody he does n't see himself riding the bus from aberdeen md to lehigh valley pa to newark and somerset and atlantic city in new jersey to bridgeport conn to nashua nh for long but for now bud harrelson is the most visible big league icon in this young league he played in two world series grappled in the dust with pete rose waved runners around third on that manic mookie night in 1986 went slightly mad managing the mets but now is a patient 56 year old builder of ball teams what else do i know harrelson said the other night i wanted something i could get involved in i did n't care for restaurants things like that i know this this venture goes beyond building malls or multiplexes or theme restaurants although it surely aims for those same discretionary dollars minor league baseball does not exist in a vacuum but rather for its mystical links to the major leagues that 35 year old playing first base for the ducks doug jennings got a hit in the 1990 world series for oakland that chap sitting by the newark dugout the very hands on owner of the bears rick cerone once told off his owner a chap named steinbrenner that youngster smacking the ball for the bears bobby hill an all american out of the university of miami is only waiting for the major league draft in june catch him now for single digit dollars right in downtown newark where the old newark bears once produced future yankees the purpose of this league is to make money draw fans win games propel players toward the majors teach the game entertain all at the same time harrelson regards baseball as something worth passing on the way others passed it on to him there was charles dillon stengel waiting impatiently for the youth of america one early spring the hapless mets brought in a scrawny shortstop and suggested he try switch hitting why would n't ya wan na as the old man used to say in socratic fashion i was out in the back cage one morning all by myself just taking my cuts harrelson recalled the other night suddenly i heard this voice 'hey he put me in the starting lineup that day led off against bob gibson batting lefty i bunted one down the third base line for a hit casey turned him over to solomon hemus a savvy coach and roy mcmillan a grizzled shortstop until the kid was ready now harrelson aims for the same instincts casey had the other night in newark he sent his 35 year old player coach bert heffernan a catcher who went 1 for 11 for seattle in 1992 out to play left field to get some swings heffernan who had sought out the ducks so he could stay home on long island had two hits and drove in two runs harrelson was almost as thrilled as heffernan then there was a touch of hodges one of the greatest players managers and human beings not yet in the baseball hall of fame the other night a pitch hit a ducks batter on the foot and ricocheted to the catcher just about everybody saw it that way but the umpire harrelson strolled out methodically the way hodges had done in the 1969 world series when he produced the ball a ball with a smudge that looked like shoe polish insisting that very ball had hit cleon jones on the shoe i said 'it hit the batter first harrelson said the other night the umpire said 'oh i did n't see it rather amazingly the ump waved the batter to first did it help that harrelson is also president of the league who knows tom o'malley the bears manager who had a career in north america and japan knew he was whipped just as earl weaver had known back in 1969 gil never argued harrelson said later he just talked the hip fans know they are watching a glorious history the youngsters know they can get close to ball players who sign autographs and can play a little our prices are cheaper too said the manager who has a piece of the action
 giants players said that coach jim fassel informed them today in a morning meeting that he would be calling the team 's offensive plays a switch that would take the responsibility out of the hands of sean payton the offensive coordinator the giants have scored seven offensive touchdowns in seven games 50 points in their last 53 possessions fassel has only a few options for substantive change and with his team dangling on the edge of oblivion he will be the one who determines the plays kerry collins will call in the huddle sunday night against the jacksonville jaguars we do n't blame coach payton for fumbling the ball or jumping offsides for holding calls tight end dan campbell said coach payton is not out there doing those things we are unfortunately he ended up taking the fall for it not him as in we 're putting the blame on him a change had to be made and it was made and now it 's up to us fassel would not acknowledge in a news conference that he would call the plays on sunday for the sake of competitive advantage and he and payton answered questions about the forthcoming change as if it were hypothetical but fassel has already informed payton of his decision which seems borne more out of circumstance than any particular dissatisfaction with the way payton has done his job i will make any changes necessary within the limits of knowing we 're not in training camp now fassel said i 'm not going to sit still and watch us average one touchdown per game i 'm not going to do it when something needs to be done when we need to shake things up i will make a change payton said he would disagree with a decision to change his role i do n't know that play calling is the reason we 're 3 4 let 's just say that but his outward demeanor did not waver as he spoke he indicated he would continue to work diligently and prepare for games in whatever role he is assigned there are certain people whose heads are on a different plane than others payton said it 's always been a head coach a coordinator a quarterback that 's part of the deal and that 's part of the responsibility to these positions i take full responsibility for what we 've done on offense from there we 'll see what happens he 's the head coach ultimately he 's in charge i 'm sure he 'll do what 's best for this team payton joined the giants before the 1999 season and that december fassel turned over the play calling role to him because of his respect for payton 's ability and because he said it would allow him more time to address other parts of the job of head coach the giants went to the super bowl the next season but this season has gone badly for the offense the giants have moved the ball easily in the middle of the field with collins throwing to amani toomer jeremy shockey and ike hilliard but the team 's running game in short yardage situations has been atrocious sabotaging the offense inside the opponents 20 yard line the giants have scored touchdowns in only 5 of 19 opportunities inside the red zone a crucial moment for the struggling offense came against arizona on sept 29 with the giants deep in their own territory and only 14 seconds remaining in the first half fassel decided to try for another score payton called a play and collins threw an interception that justin lucas ran back for a touchdown the giants are 1 3 since then generating few points and too many turnovers and penalties if this is something that happens coach fassel is smart enough to understand things that we do well and things that we do n't do well and things that we want done payton said he understands kerry 's strengths and weaknesses he 's called plays a long time payton is in the midst of a difficult period his mother jeanne payton died less than two weeks ago and now he is essentially facing a demotion this profession will always be a bottom line business payton said and i 'm big enough to understand that i understood that when i took this position if things should change sean payton will do just fine trust me extra points ron dixon will step into the starting role in place of ike hilliard who is out for the rest of the season after dislocating his right shoulder but the rookie tim carter will probably begin practicing some of the routes hilliard and dixon have run he could challenge dixon for that spot in a couple of weeks guard jason whittle received an injection in his injured lower back and it greatly decreased his discomfort if whittle can play against jacksonville giants coach jim fassel said he would step back into his old starting job and dusty zeigler would be bumped out of the lineup
 a powerful laser developed by israel and the united states to shoot down rockets has passed its first test at the white sands missile range in new mexico hitting a stationary target american military officials said this week if it is eventually deployed the system would apparently be the first antimissile defense of any kind based on lasers to my knowledge no nation has ever deployed an antimissile system based on a laser said lt col rick lehner a spokesman for the ballistic missile defense organization at the pentagon designed and built by a california contractor trw for israel and the united states army the laser and its tracking system were tested last week against stationary targets said lt gen john costello commander of the united states army space and missile defense command general costello said the system the tactical high energy laser would probably be tested this month against a moving katyusha rocket if that test is successful he said the system will be shipped to israel for further testing and deployment it will be the first engagement of the katyusha rocket by a tactical high energy laser something that is militarily useful the general said the israeli defense ministry said it planned to deploy the system along its northern border to shoot down guerrilla rockets after israel withdraws from lebanon in the summer a spokesman for the ministry dan weinreich said the weapon was in the final stages of testing in the united states and israel a spokesman for the space and missile defense command marco morales said the cost to develop the system through the first attempted shoot down was 190 million at a briefing this week in huntsville ala on missile defense general costello said developing the system over five years could in fact revolutionize warfare by protecting troops from rockets mortars and other artillery but he said using lasers in rain and fog needed special experiments the possible deployment of the laser though its geographic range is modest represents a striking turnaround for an antimissile technology that was criticized as unworkable in the strategic defense initiative of the 1980 's since then most american antimissile systems have turned to hit to kill technology that means that a rocket propelled vehicle maneuvers toward an incoming missile to collide with and therefore destroy it but the united states military has also continued long term research and development on laser based systems those include the israeli american program for intercepting short range missiles an air force program to shoot ballistic missiles like iraqi scuds using a laser on a boeing 747 jumbo jet and a joint venture by the air force and the ballistic missile defense organization at the pentagon to develop lasers that could be fired from space to destroy intercontinental ballistic missiles all those lasers would derive their energy from powerful chemical reactions and destroy the missiles by heating them to high temperatures although the israeli american laser if successful would intercept rockets in the middle or end of their flights the others would try to destroy missiles earlier as their boosters fired the technology has come a long way since the early star wars days in terms of developing lasers that could in the future destroy a ballistic missile colonel lehner said the laser 's exact power range and repetition rate for firing are classified

 to the editor the letter harm reduction is deceptive is correct in saying harm reduction is an approach that concedes drug abuse prevention is impossible surely neither the writer nor any other serious observer could believe otherwise given the resistance of the problem to decades of costly commitment education and severe sanctions and if one concedes that which ca n't be denied that drug abuse will persist despite all the measures that we can and should take to try to prevent it then what could be more rational humane and consistent with the interest of americans than to seek to reduce the harm with which it is associated dr robert newman new york the writer is the director of the chemical dependency institute at beth israel medical center

 rite 13 begun as an episcopal version of the jewish bar and bat mitzvah ceremony originated in durham nc in the mid 1980 's at st philip 's church now more than 1200 episcopal and other protestant churches in the united states have adopted the rite according to the publisher that distributes the rite 13 program we were looking at the jewish tradition of bar and bat mitzvahs said the rev cathie caimono who runs the youth program at st philip 's we realized there were no established rites of passage for adolescents in our church and our culture we thought we wanted to do something similar for our kids until fairly recently the traditional age for confirming one 's baptismal vows in the episcopal church was 13 according to bishop catherine roskam of the episcopal diocese of new york it has been a growing trend at episcopal churches in the united states to confirm teenagers when they are between 14 and 18 most 13 year olds are n't ready to make that kind of commitment to religion she said rite 13 is a terrific program because when young people have been through rite 13 they are really ready to confirm their baptismal vows they know what they are doing another reason for the need for rite 13 is that the spiritual road traveled in adolescence tends to be tumultuous many worried parents and ministers say and often teenagers drift away from the church especially in the northeast their friends are being bar or bat mitzvahed said the rev stephen holton of st paul 's church in ossining which adopted rite 13 in fall 2000 our kids are saying 'hey we want something too so staff members at st philip 's designed a program meant for children and teenagers between the ages of 11 and 17 that includes religious training social service and discussion of sex and relationships topics covered include prayer poverty leadership and nonviolence rite 13 signifies the start of their journey to adulthood at the rite 13 service conducted sometimes for one child and sometimes for a group the child reads aloud from psalm 139 answers questions from the minister and receives a blessing with his or her parents standing behind much like a jewish child in a bar or bat mitzvah service after the blessing the child instead of sitting with his or her parents sits with other teenagers who have already undergone the rite while the rite 13 program was originally meant for episcopal youth other denominations presbyterian methodist baptist lutheran have bought the curriculum from its massachusetts based publisher leaderresources according to linda l grenz its executive director of the 100 episcopal dioceses in the united states 22 have licensed the curriculum

 is there a new york kid of 50 who hears the name topps and does not wistfully recall a baseball card of mickey mantle or roger maris packed with a slice of gum a whippersnapper who went on to a career in law might also be aware of two decades of suits against the company for restraint of trade for years thanks to exclusive contracts with the players topps had a lock on baseball cards off anyway to the topps company offices we go to meet arthur t shorin 65 a second generation baseball card man now the company chief executive he is a friendly unpretentious man who comes to fetch his visitors from the reception area himself it is somewhat disconcerting entering his office to learn that what mr shorin desires in the height of world series fever is to show off his company 's other products specifically a line of lollipops called push pops one of which is disguised to look like a writing instrument see you take it to school put it in your pocket it looks like a pen mr shorin says then when the teacher turns away here he whips it out of his pocket and makes a happy slurp slurp noise we also have push pop jumbo and push pop triple power three different flavors three different colors though topps is known for sports cards it 's also in the candy business and the candy business is bigger than the sports business it is also disappointing hoping for a peek at a collection of vintage cards to learn that the only baseball card mr shorin owns is one in a limited edition he made for president george bush but perhaps the gloomiest moment comes in discussion of the change in baseball cards one has heard that topps baseball cards no longer come with gum you betcha says mr shorin cheerfully that stopped eight years ago when collectors said gum stained the cards that would be grownup collectors sure they represent 70 percent of the market so they rule mr shorin says he capitulated yes i capitulated that 's called marketing oh what has become of the topps company of youth which operated out of a little factory in brooklyn and manufactured bazooka bubble gum gone with your 32 inch waist fella and any illusions you had left that joe dimaggio was a prince topps today is a publicly held company with headquarters in lower manhattan and sales of 286 million for the first six months of this year of that 64 million came from the sales of pokemon products a smart acquisition that last for industry wide sales of sports cards according to sports collectors digest have fallen 67 percent since the 1991 boom mr shorin has nothing against baseball he 'd like to see series games played a little earlier so kids might get a chance to see them but you want to hear awe and respect in his voice listen to the way he talks about men who can sell his father and three uncles for instance who created the topps company in 1938 those guys were smart the major gum manufacturers could not get enough sugar to run their factories during world war ii so the shorin brothers bought up small candy companies took their sugar quotas and were able to produce looking for a way to lift sales after the war the brothers add baseball cards to their gum in 1951 they ensure success by signing up promising young players to long term exclusive contracts and defended that exclusivity for 30 years arthur shorin who grows up in the crown heights section of brooklyn does not plan a career in business he dreams of being a broadway composer and is still more excited recalling the two hours he spent with oscar hammerstein ii playing him his songs than talking baseball he had some success steve lawrence of steve and eydie recorded a few of his songs even so at 21 he joined topps why truth be known i loved business i genuinely loved it his new venture will be selling cards on ebay in a process called an initial player offering best to let mr shorin explain you say 'i want to take a position in timo perez i think he 's got a great future i think the value of the card is gon na go up you put in to buy 25 cards you are notified of an ipo an initial player offering coming public we might get an order for 35000 cards we 're only selling 6000 cards so you will be informed that you got 8 cards your credit card is charged those cards appear on your portfolio increasingly excited he says his company can store the cards for you the buyer has the comfort of knowing the quality of that card that it has not left the vault one envisions cards unsmeared by sweat chocolate pocket gunk a vision as heartening as a baseball stadium clean of soda cups and hand scrawled signs after the game which is to say a game without heart how old does a person have to be to bid on an initial player offering you have to have a credit card though there will be a provision later for people to set up a portfolio for your kid grandma will be able to give a gift that 's awful mr shorin is told i can tell you the research we 've done shows they love it the word research in a discussion about baseball that 's it the game is over until spring

 the big east rebounding from the defection of three of its members to the atlantic coast conference ranged to the midwest and to the south to reconfigure itself yesterday by welcoming louisville

be felt immediately in the coming months the big east must renegotiate its television deals with abc and espn as part of a reconfiguration clause in the contracts the networks are likely to offer much less for football especially because the league will consist of rutgers pittsburgh syracuse temple west virginia connecticut and boston college a lame duck next season temple will be dropped from the conference for the 2005 6 season the big east has separate contracts for football and basketball tranghese said but he declined to say for how much an athletic official at a big east member college says the league commands 15 million annually for football and basketball louisville 7 1 is enjoying a fine football season and has played in 10 bowl games but the teams at louisville and cincinnati have all time records below 500 and connecticut is in only its fourth year in division i a south florida was founded in 1956 began playing football in 1997 and has yet to be invited to a bowl game although it has posted a 49 25 record the big east athletic directors and college leaders who gathered yesterday played down their perilous footing in the bcs and pointed to the often glorious tradition of football at colleges like pittsburgh and syracuse they also noted the hold the conference now has on coveted major media markets the new configuration will be able to reach nearly 24 million households with television or 22 percent of the nation according to the conference it 's a market driven entity pittsburgh 's athletic director jeff long said of the bcs if you look at the conference as a whole we 're the sixth strongest and outdistance the seventh  or eighth best conferences by a long way the new additions are a boon for the big east 's now 16 member basketball conference marquette reached the final four last season cincinnati is a perennial title contender under coach bob huggins and louisville already has two national titles 1980 and 1986 and a successful charismatic coach in rick pitino who led kentucky to the 1996 national title and three other teams to the final four including providence of the big east this association will provide us the national stage that we all desire louisville 's vice president and director of athletics tom jurich said yesterday at a news conference on the louisville campus this athletic department has worked long and hard over the last six years to put ourselves in the position to be attractive to a conference as prestigious as the big east depaul with a rich tradition in the sport will also help make the big east a formidable basketball league it already includes the defending national champion syracuse the consensus preseason no 1 connecticut st john 's notre dame georgetown seton hall villanova pittsburgh providence rutgers and west virginia the teams we lost at least from a basketball perspective were not going to be a great loss for the league villanova 's president edmund dobbin said on balance we 're better off with this whether the new colleges will preserve the big east 's status in football may depend on whether the bcs survives in its current form either way the bcs established six years ago as a way to determine the best two football teams in the nation and match them in a title game has reshaped the college landscape and opened an often vitriolic dialogue about the role of intercollegiate athletics in higher education conference usa has moved quickly to address its losses adding rice southern methodist and tulsa from the western athletic conference and central florida and marshall from the mid american conference college leaders from non bcs conferences have pressed their case to lawmakers in washington that the system is exclusionary and have threatened antitrust litigation and presidents from each side of the debate continue to negotiate either a compromise or a new structure entirely that will give more conferences greater access to the money from the big bowl games who knows what the next generation of the bcs is going to be notre dame 's athletic director kevin white said right now it is like painting by numbers in the dark

 the ford motor company and the canadian auto workers union said today that they had agreed on a tentative three year contract covering 13300 workers at ford plants in canada the new contract 's provisions on pay and benefits follow closely the pattern set in a deal reached earlier this month by the union and general motors including wage increases of 3 percent in each of the first two years and 2 percent in the third year of the contract each worker will receive a signing bonus of 1000 canadian dollars 630 the talks with ford had been expected to be complicated by the company 's plans to close a plant in oakville ontario west of toronto that builds f 150 pickup trucks the closing with the loss of 1400 jobs is part of a cost cutting drive at ford plants across north america ford said it had agreed to transfer 900 of the truck plant 's workers to a nearby minivan assembly line which will be expanded at a cost of 600 million canadian dollars 378 million to produce a new mercury minivan model a third shift will be added to the minivan plant in late 2004 the closing of the pickup truck plant has been pushed back six months to july 2004 under the deal alain batty president of ford 's canadian unit said at a news conference today that the proposed investment in the minivan line would revitalize the oakville plant the company has agreed not to dismantle the pickup truck assembly line for the time being and has held out the prospect of modifying the oakville complex to permit it to produce several models on the same line for the first time in decades bargaining is not taking place simultaneously in the united states and canada the big three automakers american plants have four year agreements expiring next year with the united automobile workers each of the big three closely integrates its american and canadian operations with assembly lines in each country producing parts and vehicles for the entire north american market a strike in canada would reverberate at many vehicle and parts plants in the united states buzz hargrove president of the canadian union said he did not expect that the uaw would see much that 's a pattern for them in the deals his union struck with general motors and ford still mr hargrove said nothing in this agreement will entail moving work from the united states to canada carlos gomes an economist who watches the auto industry for the bank of nova scotia in toronto said the union did get most of the things it was attempting to get ford 's operations in the two countries were the most integrated of the big three 's he said making ford most vulnerable to a strike in canada a ratification vote on the ford contract will be held this weekend the union is then scheduled to start negotiations with daimlerchrysler in which the main issue is likely to be the future of a van plant in windsor no model is scheduled to be built there beyond mid 2003 mr hargrove said the union would announce a strike deadline at daimlerchrysler on oct 7 mr hargrove said he was confident that no layoffs would be needed at oakville an improved retirement incentive totaling 60000 canadian dollars 37800 would probably encourage at least 500 older workers to retire there he said creating openings for workers who would otherwise be laid off under the existing contract the base wage at ford is 2770 canadian dollars 1746 an hour for assembly line workers and 3310 canadian dollars 2086 an hour for electricians mechanics and other trades the auto industry has broken sales records in both the united states and canada this year with the help of generous discounts and interest free financing deals however september sales are expected to show a slight slackening reflecting some analysts concern that the market may be nearly saturated mr gomes said that given the present strength of automotive sales and the fierce competition among manufacturers a strike in canada would cost any of the big three companies much more than acceding to the union 's demands would
 it began with boos during st john 's humiliating 71 54 loss to virginia tech on saturday it continued yesterday with irate fans on radio talk shows and in internet chat rooms the cries for st john 's coach mike jarvis to be fired come as the red storm slouches toward an early exit to the season st john 's 11 8 4 5 big east will need a grand finish in its last eight games beginning tonight at villanova 13 8 6 2 to entertain the notion of an at large bid to the ncaa tournament or it will have to win the big east tournament jarvis remained placid in an interview yesterday but his boss athletic director david wegrzyn said you can see when you 're close to him the frustration that he feels because the things he 's trying have not been as fruitful as he had hoped jarvis said that the debacle at alumni hall against virginia tech which has never qualified for the big east tournament reaffirmed his dedication to the job but the red storm 's lack of hustle and continued reliance on marcus hatten have lit a fire under jarvis 's critics many are paying customers they jeered early in the second half and yelled fire jarvis in the final minutes if that will help people get their mind off the war then that 's their prerogative jarvis said that goes with the territory these days the venting continued yesterday a chat room rant at jarvis in a popular red storm web site turned into an absurd debate over whether jeff van gundy would take over as the red storm coach jarvis is in the fifth year of a seven year deal paying an estimated 735000 annually asked about whether there had been any movement toward a contract extension he replied it 's nobody 's business the day i start worrying about a contract is the day i look for something else to do jarvis who is 98 52 at st john 's defended his record my history as coach is comparable to most coaches in america he said my teams generally are in the tournament more than most are but comparable has not been the expectation at st john 's the university is sixth in college history in victories won the national invitation tournament four times when it was the premier tournament and made the ncaa final four in 1985 in his first season jarvis led st john 's to the ncaa tournament round of 8 with three future nba players ron artest lavor postell and erick barkley recruited by the previous coach fran fraschilla jarvis 's team won the big east tournament the next season but slumped to 14 15 in his third season it was the one time st john 's missed the ncaa tournament during his tenure last season st john 's rode hatten 's talents to a 20 12 record and the ncaa tournament 's first round jarvis recruited the mcdonald 's all american elijah ingram to play point guard this season beside hatten but ingram 's confidence has vacillated and the rest of the team has fizzled as a supporting cast tom konchalski a recruiting expert who publishes high school basketball insider said jarvis 's recruiting had suffered because he had not cultivated enough relationships with amateur athletic union coaches the recruiting pipeline from the riverside church aau program which produced chris mullin mark jackson and artest was compromised after a former player accused the founder ernie lorch of molesting him lorch resigned last year part of the problem is that jarvis who coached in boston and washington before coming to st john 's is not a new york product konchalski added konchalski suggested that jarvis make his new york savvy assistant dermon player more visible on the recruiting trail i 'm not sure if st john 's has lost ground in new york city but i think their competition is gaining ground in those areas said steve keller editor of the national recruiting report subscribed to by duke st john 's and others so that someone like seton hall and possibly someone like rutgers are likely to be more of a competition for them where before they had locks providence coach tim welsh who used to coach at iona disagreed he said st john 's was always right there on its recruiting turf anthony glover the fifth year forward for the red storm who played at rice high school in harlem said st john 's would continue to be a prized destination for local prep stars even after a down season not that the red storm was writing off this campaign this season is n't over yet jarvis said there is no extra pressure on me and i hope there 's none on the kids other than doing the best we can do

 joe torre clutched a baseball bat wrapped by a sanitary sock like a baby clinging to a rattle after the yankees secured their fourth straight american league east title on a surreal and subdued tuesday night at yankee stadium apparently the drained torre needed something to hang on to after an evening of retrospection and relief everyone needs something or someone these days long before the terrorist attacks changed our world two weeks ago the yankees usually hung on to torre the manager has shepherded them to three straight world series titles and four in the last five years with a relaxed confident approach that diminished the chaos that can envelop the yankees torre has been a constant a face to trust a voice to offer encouragement a leader to believe in he still is now in the sometimes unexplainable world of george steinbrenner torre 's future which is incredibly still tenuous could be determined by his players steinbrenner has offered a plethora of excuses for why he has not offered torre a contract extension but some people who have talked to the principal owner recently think he is waiting to see if the yankees win another championship before deciding torre 's fate shockingly the yankees might have to win it all to keep torre in the bronx that is no fantasy there is no other rational explanation for why torre who told friends that he hoped to sign a contract last march is still waiting the television network steinbrenner was so consumed with has been formed any issues about a new or improved stadium have been pushed aside because a wounded city needs to repair lower manhattan what is steinbrenner 's excuse for the delay now he must be waiting for torre to prove himself again i do n't think one has anything to do with the other torre said before the yankees defeated the tampa bay devil rays 5 1 last night at the stadium torre is fooling himself why else would steinbrenner have waited this long steinbrenner did not return a telephone call yesterday but torre said he expected to meet with him in tampa next week they met there last month but reported no progress torre initiated a meeting with steinbrenner in july then happily told reporters we both want it to happen and made it seem as if an agreement were imminent two months later the only thing that is imminent are more doubts about a manager who has helped make steinbrenner millions and helped make the yankees perennial winners torre claimed he is no longer anxious about his future because he knows he will have a job somewhere next year i 've gotten past that torre said yeah i have i really do n't know why but i have when torre was asked if he considers it strange that he is not signed yet he said yeah it is that 's all i can say i do n't know since torre is seeking between 5 million and 7 million a season and wants at least a three year contract steinbrenner is balking one club official said steinbrenner 's stalling tactics are all about gaining leverage but the official added that steinbrenner would be vilified if he ever allowed torre and general manager brian cashman another lame duck to leave they have been as successful as any duo in franchise history yet steinbrenner is making them twist like neophytes torre has already expressed his willingness to manage elsewhere if the yankees do not keep him or satisfy him a shrewd negotiating tactic if torre were available whoever purchases the red sox should sprint to hire him technically the boston manager joe kerrigan has more job security than torre since he is signed through 2003 obviously that is irrelevant still it is laughable that torre 's future is as uncertain as kerrigan 's this is too important a year to have anything else monopolize my time said torre acting like a diplomat some baseball officials have already heard buck showalter 's name linked with the yankees again a topic showalter has refused to discuss torre replaced showalter after the 1995 season and if anyone thinks the possibility of showalter returning is slim do not forget that steinbrenner tried to rehire showalter a few days after he hired torre bringing managers back is like riding a bicycle for steinbrenner he never forgets how to do it of course showalter would be walking on sizzling coals if he ever succeeded torre even if the yankees do not win the title this season the manager who replaces torre will be replacing someone known as teflon torre and st joe but showalter has told friends there is still something special to him about being a yankee an indication that he would agree to work for an owner he grew to loathe and to work in torre 's gargantuan shadow the yankees are trying to further seal their place in history by becoming the first team in almost five decades to win four straight titles they are trying to help a city cope by winning and providing a diversion from a tragedy and whether they realize it or not the yankees might also be trying to save torre 's job the mere thought of that is unbelievable

 after holding the washington capitals to one shot in the first period thursday night the devils gathered to discuss staying alert against an opponent that was bad on offense and even worse on defense we did n't want them to get going goaltender martin brodeur said what unfolded now fills a line in the devils record book in their 3 0 victory they held the capitals to nine shots the fewest the devils have allowed in a regular season home game the previous record for a home game was 11 accomplished three times most recently against carolina on oct 29 2002 the devils record for fewest shots allowed in a regular season game is eight set dec 18 1996 in a 2 1 victory at vancouver the devils 13 5 6 0 ended a four game streak without a victory and by shutting out the capitals 8 16 1 1 they snapped robert lang 's 16 game point streak and jaromir jagr 's 12 game point streak they also took 41 shots a season high against capitals goalie olaf kolzig it 's no magic secret situation devils coach pat burns said it 's just hard work brodeur posted his fifth shutout of the season and the 69th of his career the capitals did not take a shot until 3 minutes 37 seconds was left in the first period they added four shots in the first eight minutes of the second but none for the rest of the period the devils had scored only two goals in their previous three games but had two goals before 10 minutes had been played thursday as far as 60 minutes that was impressive said right wing turner stevenson who had a goal and an assist that was one of the stronger games by everybody paul martin the 22 year old rookie defenseman scored the devils first goal and assisted on the second martin took a drop pass from igor larionov and skipped a shot past kolzig at 2 25 it was martin 's second nhl goal he scored it with a stick he borrowed from defenseman scott niedermayer maybe i 'll keep using it if he does n't mind he said jagr ended a capitals power play four seconds early by holding brian rafalski 's stick martin then got the puck at the point on the power play and fired a shot that stevenson tipped in at 9 10 in the third period stevenson muscled a loose puck to jeff friesen who beat kolzig at 5 30 friesen 's goal was only his fifth of the season and his first since nov 12 just getting goals in general is a good thing for this hockey team friesen said

 kelly wunsch said that the chicago white sox never planned to challenge major league baseball 's steroid testing rules but they did so last march as players circulated a drug test acceptance form wunsch said a few wondered what would happen if they refused to be tested what would happen the white sox players learned is that they could seriously influence the future of testing when 16 of the 37 players on the roster did not want to be tested initially they found out that a refusal would count as a positive and would increase the chances that major leaguers would surpass the 5 percent threshold to activate stricter testing in 2004 some had the foresight to realize they could have an impact on forcing mandatory tests by declining to be tested this year after wunsch the white sox player representative discussed this with the union gene orza the union 's associate general counsel told him that each refusal would be reviewed and that almost no reasons for bypassing the test would be permitted the holdouts some of whom sandy alomar jr said were pushed into their decisions by veteran players nonetheless sent a message about their desire for testing to ensure that everyone would be on an even playing field in the future wunsch said the 16 players eventually gave their urine samples it was never meant to be a political statement or something to get media attention wunsch said last week in a telephone interview if somebody respects us for doing that that 's fine i do n't think that we deserve any more respect than anybody who does n't want cheating in the game wunsch a 6 foot 5 reliever who packs all of 225 pounds onto his gangly frame said he hoped that steroid use would be reduced because of the stiff penalties taking effect next year after 5 percent to 7 percent of the 1198 tests came back positive starting next year a player who tests positive twice will be identified and may be suspended 15 games or fined 10000 or both suspensions and fines escalate with each ensuing positive test nobody is happy to see there are 5 percent of the players doing steroids wunsch said but i 'm happy there 's going to be punitive testing so we can get that number lower a lot of guys you talk with hope this leads to steroids being out of the game wunsch thinks the anonymous testing was effective because he said he saw a number of physiques early on this year that did n't look quite the same wunsch figures more physiques will shrink he said because the thought of having your name attached to steroids is unnerving while wunsch said being identified as a steroid user would be a powerful deterrent he called the potential suspensions and fines fairly soft handed and suggested that players be fined a percentage of their salaries that could make a positive test both embarrassing and more costly regardless of how it happened the players tripped it wunsch said i 'm happy that it 's going to be instituted not only does it get guys off steroids it eliminates the temptation for guys who thought about using them defection pre empted kendry morales is considered the next great cuban phenomenon a power hitter who can play first base third base and the outfield so why did the cubans send the 20 year old morales home from the olympic qualifying tournament in panama two weeks ago the team said morales left for personal reasons but carlos rodriguez president of the cuban national baseball commission said later on state television that an unidentified player had been approached by scouts and offered the opportunity to defect and sign with the yankees or another team kendry morales is their prize roberto gonzalez echevarria a professor at yale university who has written extensively about cuban baseball said by telephone last week he was sent back because they were afraid he was going to defect gordon blakeley the yankees senior vice president for baseball operations said that carlos rios had been scouting in panama but that rios did not get involved in helping players defect the yankees become interested blakeley said once the players are out of cuba we obviously like cuban players blakeley said in a telephone interview we want them to come over here and be free agents because we have the money to sign them i would doubt any of our people would say that to a player since two players pitcher maels rodriguez and second baseman yobal duenas defected last month the cubans have been wary about a player of morales 's caliber javier mendez a renowned cuban player told the kansas city star that morales can become cuba 's greatest ballplayer all time gonzalez echevarria said that morales who plays for industriales could be punished if the cubans felt he was receptive to the scout and that he would be closely monitored i 'm sure he 's seen the things that have happened with other players in cuba and said 'the heck with it gonzalez echevarria said he 's got to get out of cuba music men while the yankees and the red sox were competing for first place last season bernie williams heard that boston 's tim wakefield also an accomplished guitarist wanted a copy of his compact disc the journey within so rivalry be damned williams sent it to him and rivalry be damned again wakefield played it around his teammates he 's a brilliant musician wakefield said during the playoffs it 's something to aspire to loren harriet the cd 's producer said it had been ranked third to seventh on billboard 's contemporary jazz chart for 18 consecutive weeks next month williams could receive more exciting news his record label submitted his cd to be nominated for a grammy award it 's a real real long shot harriet said but you never know 'a young pedro how high will the montreal expos price for javier vazquez be in a trade

him martinez was 65 39 with a 300 earned run average in his first six seasons vazquez is 64 68 with a 416 era in the same period close but not identical clearly though minaya is using this comparison in trade discussions including how martinez proceeded to go 101 28 with a 226 era in six seasons with boston all for charity among the items auctioned at keith hernandez 's charity dinner last

 in one of the biggest flameouts yet on germany 's new market the company that recently acquired the sesame street characters escaped financial collapse today by announcing a bailout from the kirch group the munich based media conglomerate shares of emtv and merchandising until recently one of europe 's most sparkling success stories sank 40 percent today after company executives acknowledged late friday that they would have to restate results and that earnings this year would be about one tenth what they had predicted six weeks ago emtv 's shares closed at 965 euros in frankfurt down more than 90 percent from their peak of close to 120 euros in february for europe 's new generation of risk taking investors this was more than just the collapse of another internet start up the rapid decline adds a new chill to europe 's nascent new exchanges for small companies it also provides the latest example of two broader problems the poor quality of information coming from some european companies and the gullibility of investment analysts to accept colorful stories uncritically as recently as six weeks ago respected banks from around europe were recommending emtv and predicting that the shares would bounce back from their decline founded in 1989 by two brothers thomas and florian haffa emtv built its original success by acquiring rights to children 's television programming and dazzled investors by announcing a seemingly endless stream of media deals that gave it one of the biggest libraries of children 's programming in the world thomas haffa the company 's chief executive then used the company 's stock price to help finance his leap into the big time using a mixture of stock and cash emtv bought the jim henson company and all the muppets in february for about 680 million a few weeks later he reached a deal to pay 18 billion in stock and cash for a 50 percent stake in the formula one racing organization those deals may have contributed to the haffas undoing much about emtv remains unclear but the company appears to have suffered from dubious accounting and overly ambitious acquisitions in october the company shocked investors by acknowledging that it had inflated results in the first half of this year by prematurely booking revenue from the henson company on friday evening the company acknowledged that it would have to make much bigger revisions under orders from its auditors the company disclosed it would have to reduce its earnings by an additional 300 million marks or about 135 million to square its accounting in connection with the henson and formula one deals worse the company predicted that earnings this year before interest and taxes would be a mere 50 million marks rather than the 525 million marks that florian haffa had predicted in late october florian haffa who had been chief financial officer resigned on friday after acknowledging in a brief written statement that he had lost the trust of investors and shareholders his brother thomas remains the company 's chief executive but was forced to surrender a great deal of autonomy and effectively reverse a big part of his expansionist strategy beyond mere accounting issues the company was also caught in a financial squeeze thanks to its acquisitions the company said its total debt had reached 23 billion marks or more than 1 billion but its core operating businesses were also having problems the company said today that its main business in germany had a nine month operating loss of 826 million marks or about 371 million the henson company lost nearly 4 million under a string of deals announced today by thomas haffa the company will get an infusion from the kirch group and try to shed at least one of its recent acquisitions kirch a producer and distributor of movies and television will acquire 167 percent of emtv 's stock and 25 percent of its voting rights in exchange for giving emtv full control of a joint venture between the two companies called junior library in addition the kirch group will pay about 550 million for half of emtv 's stake in formula one holdings

 as manager of the mets bobby valentine has managed to become embroiled in a series of disputes with some of his own players most recently darryl hamilton now as manager of the national league all star team he has landed in a major argument with a player from another team cliff floyd of the florida marlins this dispute which erupted yesterday arose from what valentine said or did n't say to floyd during a telephone conversation they had tuesday floyd said valentine told him he would be on the all star team valentine said he made no such commitment the outfielder 's agent seth levinson said that after the conversation floyd believed in his heart that he was going to the game he believed it to the extent that he purchased 16000 worth of airplane tickets for his parents his brother a cousin and three friends the tickets are the smoking gun levinson said valentine was told on a conference call with reporters earlier in the day that levinson had said floyd believed the manager had told him he would be on the team cliff floyd 's agent is a liar valentine responded i did n't back out of anything i talked to floyd he knows exactly what i said he called me i told him he 's on the bubble i appreciate everything he does i love him as a player we 'll see how the chips fall floyd said he heard on television that valentine said floyd misunderstood him you do n't go on the air on national television and say that i misunderstood something floyd told sporting news radio tell the truth the truth is that when i talked to him on the phone he said that i was on the team barring anything crazy now i 'm going to ask you what crazy could happen in one day the telephone conversation itself was questionable direct communication between an official of one club with a player on another club is generally not permitted under major league baseball 's tampering rules asked about the propriety of the conversation valentine initiated katy feeney a national league vice president said i would n't think it 's in the normal course of things on tuesday valentine wanted to speak to floyd he said before the mets game with the chicago cubs at shea stadium to clear up floyd 's intention regarding the all star game floyd had been quoted as saying he did n't want to play on a team managed by valentine valentine said he wanted to know if the outfielder would go to the game if he were selected because i do n't want that to be an ugly day for me valentine said that about a week ago he asked two people todd zeile the mets first baseman who has the same agent as floyd and joel sherman of the new york post to ask levinson to have floyd call him when he did n't hear from the agent or the player the manager said he asked jay horwitz the mets vice president for media relations to call levinson to arrange the call he called him cliff floyd called me about a half hour later valentine said reiterating that he never assured floyd a spot on the team however levinson supported floyd 's version of the conversation on the reliance of bobby valentine 's promise that he was a member of the all star team cliff purchased 16000 in airplane tickets for his family and friends the agent said it 's rather unreasonable and foolish to think cliff would purchase those tickets on the idea that he might replace an injured player the seven round trip tickets floyd purchased the ticket receipts show were for flights from chicago to seattle and from montreal to seattle as for valentine saying he was a liar levinson said we 'll stand by our reputation in the industry and the character of the players we represent

 the look a mixture of maddening disbelief personal agony and resignation now seems fixed to giants coach jim fassel 's face it will linger on long after this disastrous season and fassel 's reign as coach has ended the lasting image of so much promise that evaporated so painfully it took precisely five plays into the giants 45 7 loss to the saints in the superdome on sunday night for that look to overtake fassel it took only that long for the saints to throw a 50 yard touchdown pass to become the latest stumbling team to cure its many ailments against the giants new orleans 7 7 took its place on that list whose latest entrants are the falcons the buccaneers the bills and the redskins to send the giants to the latest ugliest collapse of their 4 10 season perhaps the worst indignity occurred after a saints touchdown in the second quarter when receiver joe horn retrieved a cellphone that was hidden under the padding around the upright and appeared to make a call the giants came here trying and eventually failing to avoid their sixth straight loss they have not scored more than one offensive touchdown in any game since beating the jets on nov 2 and the downward spiral only picked up steam sunday in jesse palmer 's first start at quarterback in place of the injured starter kerry collins and at the hands of a giants defense worn to the nub by injuries and ineffectiveness saints fans sung along to the christmas tunes that filled the superdome during timeouts they quickly forgot that many of them entered the game openly discussing whether quarterback aaron brooks should be stashed on the bench brooks helped their amnesia by hitting horn with that 50 yard touchdown less than two minutes into the game before it was over brooks would throw five touchdown passes four to horn who certainly made an impression with his audacious cellphone celebration the officials reacted by giving him an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and saints coach jim haslett upbraided him on the sideline it was a rare embarrassing moment in a night full of triumphs for the saints who improved to 7 7 and breathed life into their dim playoff hopes for the giants bad turned to worse very quickly starting with poor coverage on the opening kickoff and that 50 yard touchdown the play to horn which came against one on one coverage by cornerback ralph brown also cost the giants the services of brown who reinjured his separated right shoulder while trying to knock the ball out of horn 's hands in the end zone with brown out the giants used kato serwanga and ike charlton at cornerback serwanga is primarily a special teams player and charlton was an emergency signing in midseason john carney kicked a 35 yard field goal to put the saints up 10 0 in the first quarter and the giants offense could do nothing it took until 3 minutes 40 seconds remained in the first for them to record a first down a quarter in which they gained 18 yards to the saints 111 with 24 seconds left in the quarter the giants got a spark when brooks fumbled a snap and giants linebacker dhani jones recovered at the saints 39 it was brooks 's 14th fumble of the season and the ninth lost fumble a major factor in the fans discontent with their team 's starting quarterback the giants used the momentum palmer scrambled for 26 yards to the 12 he capped the drive with a 4 yard touchdown pass to tight end visanthe shiancoe to make the score 10 7 with 13 05 left in the second quarter giving the giants a rare flicker of hope it was the first touchdown pass of palmer 's 4 year career and the first touchdown catch for shiancoe a rookie it was only shiancoe 's third pro catch and it was the giants last piece of good news they reverted to form after the touchdown getting flagged for a personal foul on the kickoff then yielding a 13 play 69 yard drive that ate up 7 14 and gave the saints a 17 7 lead on a 13 yard touchdown pass from brooks to horn horn 's choice of celebration taking a cellphone stashed under some padding in back of the end zone and appearing to make a call gave the giants good field position on their next drive because of the resulting unsportsmanlike conduct penalty they then used a trick play to gain 39 yards a double reverse from receiver david tyree to amani toomer who tossed the ball back to palmer who then threw it downfield to an open tyree who caught it at the 13 but disaster struck the giants again a personal foul call on shiancoe pushed them back and matt bryant 's 43 yard field goal attempt was blocked by kenny smith picked up by cornerback fred thomas and returned 62 yards for a touchdown with 3 10 left in the half giving the saints a 24 7 lead the espn cameras desperate for anything compelling to capture showed fassel in full agony after that play the giants offensive line had collapsed to allow the block the saints added two more touchdowns in the third quarter touchdown throws by brooks of 7 yards to horn and 26 to jerome pathon one play after the giants brian mitchell fumbled a kickoff brooks threw his fifth touchdown five seconds into the fourth quarter an 18 yarder to horn that made the score 45 7 before he gave way to todd bouman the switch fans had been calling for in anger before the game by then all the anger in the building could be corralled on the giants sideline amid a team unable to stop its free fall most of the emotion was etched on fassel 's face it is the image that will not go away extra points the giants trip to new orleans turned into an adventure on saturday because the new orleans airport was fogged in for several hours after a series of thunderstorms the giants plane was diverted to mobile ala where their pilot informed them he had passed the time limit the faa places on pilots shifts so after sitting for two hours on the runway in the plane the team boarded four buses and made the two hour drive
 missing the williams sisters at this year 's united states open no need to worry you should still have ample time to enjoy the free swinging spectacle provided by tennis 's first family dismissing concerns about motivation physical ailments and the potential lure of outside interests venus williams said yesterday that she planned to play for 10 more years her younger sister serena later indicated that 10 years sounded like a nice round and accurate expiration date for her own career too oh definitely i 'm not going away said venus who turned 23 in june i 'm not retiring before 33 i 've thought about it already i 'm not giving up my great job i like it i 'm fortunate i 'm blessed and i love being out there for now and perhaps quite a few weeks more she and serena are on forced vacations recovering from injuries as their customary foils and rivals go about their sweaty business in flushing meadows while top seeded kim clijsters was preparing for her second round match yesterday which she won 6 1 6 1 and while roger federer and lindsay davenport were preparing for matches later in the day which they won the williams sisters were in midtown making the rounds of television programs and giving separate interviews to a small group of reporters in a 22nd floor hotel suite the williamses have talked little in public of late and there was much to talk about which meant that once again at this through the looking glass open the nonparticipants generated more buzz than the participants if it was not the retiring pete sampras on monday it was the recuperating williamses on wednesday and it was not lost on the sisters who have grown accustomed to complaints that their string of all in the family grand slam finals was hurting the game now that they are not playing at all they hear that it 's hurting the game too you ca n't win either way with us serena said i think obviously venus and i bring a huge aspect to tennis but i still think there 's a lot left in it as well without us but without us it is a little dry i would be dishonest if i said it was n't but at the same time it would be dishonest to say there is no fun watching the tennis not everyone loves me people like other people venus who withdrew from the open on friday is still recovering from a badly strained stomach muscle that first forced her to retire from the final of a tournament in warsaw in early may and then slowed her progress at the french open and at wimbledon maybe i should n't have played the french open and just taken more time to rest she said serena who has won five of the last six grand slam singles titles had left knee surgery in los angeles on aug 1 to repair a partial tear in the quadriceps tendon but she arrived in the lobby of the hotel in high heels and walking with only a slight limp asked if her doctor would approve of such footwear less than a month after surgery she said i do n't know if he 'd approve but i only walked a few blocks and they are not that high only three inches serena has been playing with occasional knee pain for several seasons but she said she reached a crisis point in july while preparing to leave home for a tournament in san diego it was a sudden action that made it go out she said it was not the sort of sudden movement that typically gets a tennis star in trouble instead of reaching for a wide forehand or an overhead she was reaching down for a pair of earrings i was bending down she said and i was like 'ok something is not right serena who said she had stopped practice earlier that day because of discomfort in the knee made every attempt to avoid surgery but she said that the six physicians she consulted all gave her the same answer there is less certainty about when she will return to the tour it might not be until next season and though she declined to give a specific date she also made it clear that her nontennis schedule is well booked with acting and other engagements this fall i love tennis she said it 's always my first love and i really really miss it but in a way it is kind of a relief to see that wow this actually gives me a chance to do some other stuff some acting especially serena might be the defending champion but for now venus a former champion sounds as if she misses the game and the united states open more i was coming in last night and i was passing by the stadium and i could see the big screen venus said it was just 'i want to be out there i want to play the night match sign me up i was hoping they would move the open back a few weeks so that way maybe i could be ready but nobody liked that idea venus said she had served only lightly in practice since wincing through her three set defeat to serena in the wimbledon final but though she is entered in the moscow tournament that begins sept 29 she does not plan to rush back this time serena who has also not competed since the wimbledon final proudly said she did not cry before or after surgery but she has been practicing her crying during her layoff preparing for a scene in an episode of the showtime series street time she will play a reformed gang member and the role has been expanded because she for now no longer needs to juggle tennis with acting she is also no longer no 1 in the computer ranking having been passed by clijsters earlier this month though clijsters has not won a grand slam singles title serena said she deserved the no 1 spot she 's playing every week serena said and she 's winning almost every week she plays it 's hard not to be no 1 when you play that much nonetheless serena who has played only 11 events in the past year would like to see reform of the ranking system which counts a player 's best 17 results over 52 weeks but even if the system remained untouched serena said she was confident that she would regain her former dominance and i 'm going to be a much better player because i 'm going to be mentally relaxed i 'm going to be stronger and i 'm going to be angry she said angry i 'm just going to take a different attitude take the mike tyson approach she said
 the enduring memory of this resurgent penn state season is not elation over four victories but wrath over the lone defeat upset about two calls made in an overtime loss at home to iowa joe paterno chased and grabbed referee dick honig first in a dyspeptic trot then in an incensed sprint his anger seeming to build with his speed i never realized people had a stopwatch every time i chased an official paterno said joking the other day some have found his reaction jarring even excessive for a man whose reputation remains sterling in an increasingly tarnished sport for a coach who leads major colleges in career victories and tops the big ten conference in the graduation rate of his players others have marveled at the swiftness of a guy two and a half months shy of his 76th birthday his players have taken this incensed gallop as affirmation of paterno 's enduring passion in his 37th season as head coach while he has come to represent the larger threatened virtues of dignity and character paterno remains behind his thick glasses and thin patience a coach with a voracious appetite for winning and a heartburn 's irritability over losing he 's into the game just as much as we are anthony adams a senior defensive tackle said some measure of vindication was granted paterno when two members of the officiating crew that worked the iowa game on sept 28 were later suspended by the big ten i was n't surprised he said nor is he astonished at the turnaround his team has made winning 9 of its last 12 games after starting 0 4 last season climbing from unaccustomed despair into the lower reaches of the top 25 if others stopped believing he never did while fans and pundits questioned whether paterno was over the hill resistant to change he remained confident resolved resourceful it shows he 's got resiliency and he knows the game it proves a lot of things that people have been saying about him were wrong jay paterno joe 's son and coach of penn state 's quarterbacks said i 'm sure he heard those things that the game had passed him by he took it as a challenge he thrives on that penn state which is no 11 in the new york times computer ranking can make another impressive stitch in its repaired glory with a victory at michigan on saturday it will not come easily the wolverines have won five straight games in this rivalry the nittany lions inventive offense has been imperiled by a sprained throwing shoulder of quarterback zack mills and a hamstring strain for tailback larry johnson and the defense has played erratically surrendering 66 points in two conference games this is the biggest game i 've played in and the biggest game for the program in a couple of years mills a redshirt sophomore said one or two games is not going to bring back penn state football and make everyone happy we have to continue to play well and win in order for that to happen the previous two years lapsed into the first consecutive losing seasons under paterno he admitted in august that he may have let some small things slip not objecting enough to things he did not like not scurrying often enough from drill to drill in practice not growing as certain as he should have been about a particular lineup if you 're the head coach you have to have your stamp he said his stamp is decidedly on this team when the starting cornerback richard gardner and punter dave royer were three minutes late for a team bus the night before a game against louisiana tech paterno benched them for the first half defensive linemen said he was again running over to them in practice furious over small mistakes that others had not seen he has even demonstrated the intricacies of the center snap in the shotgun formation he 's not letting anything slide adams said yet at 75 paterno remains flexible open to suggestion last saturday he let place kicker robbie gould talk him into a 51 yard field goal attempt that provided the thin margin in a 34 31 victory at wisconsin penn state 's offense once derided as antique for its predictable muscle has blossomed like some exotic flower with the shotgun the sprint option and multiple receivers who stretch a defense like taffy rather than let rust the plentiful skills of michael robinson a redshirt freshman quarterback paterno has used him as a split end and running back robinson scored 5 touchdowns the first 10 times he touched the ball and paterno has scrapped a committee approach at tailback settling on johnson last season penn state rushed for a meager 1317 yards the lowest in the paterno era this season the spread offense has facilitated the run and the nittany lions are averaging 100 yards more a game on the ground a reinvigorated johnson leads the big ten and is second in the nation with 1852 all purpose yards a game a coach who has been around that long been so successful you 'd think might be kind of stuck in his ways said mills who set a school record with 399 passing yards against iowa give him credit for opening up he is not reinventing himself only adapting to his personnel paterno insists as far back as 1959 when he coached the penn state quarterbacks the nittany lions played a run and gun offense with a double wing and the option he reminded reporters his 1994 team went undefeated with the productive throwing of kerry collins often scoring with the speed of microwave popcorn i got trapped in my own joke about being conservative he said in an interview asked if he felt redeemed this season or whether he was amused or angered that people questioned his ability a year ago paterno said he did not coach to gain approval from others the game is the thing he said i enjoy saturdays and preparing for saturdays what the fans think whether they think i 'm over the hill i do n't pay attention to the fact that some people think i 'm great and i do n't pay attention to the fact that some people think i 'm a bum you do that you go nuts penn state is winning again and paterno said he might sign a new five year contract his most delicate job is planning for succession without signaling that he is ready to leave what else would he do but coach he has often said he does not fish or play golf and the only way he knows to start the lawn mower is to scream for his wife sue he 's got 11 grandchildren all under the age of 8 jay paterno said with a laugh i think he 's scared to death being home with all of them at one time that 's what 's driving him that and an unsated desire to win on saturday afternoons at wisconsin the policeman who escorts the officials told me he was working on his sprints all week to defend against joe jay paterno said

 michael doleac 's signing by the knicks as a low priced free agent this summer hardly made a ripple next to the draft day deal that brought antonio mcdyess to new york doleac 's injury a strained hamstring sustained on the first day of camp brought far less interest than mcdyess 's season ending knee injury or latrell sprewell 's broken hand but while mcdyess is gone for the season and sprewell 's future is uncertain doleac participated in the knicks practice session today and said he would be ready to contribute when the knicks open their season wednesday in detroit that may not excite fans of a team of which little is expected but the 6 foot 11 doleac is not exactly cowering at the prospect of making his initial appearance as a knick i just come out and play he said everyone talks about the new york media and pressure and fans i do n't care i 'm here to play basketball play hard and have fun if doleac seems poised to make a quiet debut consider that he was unrecruited out of high school chose the university of utah after attending a basketball camp there and wound up as the 12th player selected in the 1998 national basketball association draft after enjoying success playing for rick majerus at utah doleac has drifted through his first four professional seasons three in orlando and then last season in cleveland he has averaged 62 points and 37 rebounds in 169 minutes a game you 're not going to win every game or lose every game doleac said but if you play hard you 're going to give yourself a good shot at being successful that 's just what i learned from majerus on down if you step on the court go hard and the other stuff takes care of itself after a preseason that seemed more useful to the career he aspires to as an orthopedic surgeon doleac was back banging in practice it was nice to hit some people today said doleac who will be counted on for defense and rebounding as a backup center you 've just got to roll with the punches and make the best of the situation i 'll be fine i just have to keep working i tried to pay attention best i could so i know the plays i know the concepts i know how it 's supposed to work the knicks who have 15 players on the roster have until 6 pm monday to cut down to 12 active ones sprewell 's status is uncertain latrell sprewell will accompany the knicks on their initial road trip to detroit and philadelphia but he is uncertain whether he will do so on the injured list or whether he will even wear a knicks uniform again despite statements by scott layden the team 's president and general manager that sprewell will play for the knicks sprewell is not convinced i do n't know sprewell said today that 's something at this point i ca n't control never have been able to control if it happens it happens if not i 'll be here trying to help the team just when that help will come is uncertain too on friday sprewell said that he would not rush back from his broken right hand a point he repeated today on thursday he said he would have his hand re examined and x rayed on tuesday but today sprewell did not have a date figured out for the exam sprewell said that allan houston and kurt thomas would have to carry the knicks until he returns but he also said that if the knicks plan to use the medical exception for salary granted by the league in the wake of antonio mcdyess 's injury a big body would be the way to go we 've got enough small guys he said especially if i can get back and lavor postell is healthy as well i know he 's anxious to get out there and prove something i think if we get everybody healthy it would be wise to get a big guy

 the 2000 giants could win their remaining games win the national football conference east earn a playoff bye and then defeat a team like the philadelphia eagles in the second round of the playoffs they would have won 13 of 17 games the third best record in the modern era of the franchise only the two super bowl teams won more games the giants would be preparing for the nfc championship game and if a team like the minnesota vikings stumbled along the way the giants could even play that game at giants stadium they would be a game away from the super bowl and what would people be saying about the giants that they have n't beaten anyone good yet it would be funny if it were n't so true without question the giants have not yet passed the essential crossroads of their season they could still bow out early from the playoffs or they might still collapse and not make the playoffs at all no one should be labeling them super bowl contenders but the skepticism about their achievements this season has gone too far people are confusing aesthetics with accomplishment at some point the giants deserve praise for making so much of a season that began with insignificant expectations they have played well and maybe it 's time to just say that and leave it at that the giants have an image problem and it has little to do with football yards first downs points the problem stems from the fact that the giants are rarely fun to watch when they are bad as they were against detroit two weeks ago they are revolting when they are good as they were against washington on sunday they are less revolting but do not miss the larger point the giants are winning the way they have to right now if it eventually catches up with them against a team like minnesota remember that super bowl teams are usually not built in a season it does not mean that the giants are not making progress they are it 's true there is no dynamic quality to the offense in fact the giants can be frustrating with the ball are they a run based team led by tiki barber and ron dayne or a medium range passing team directed by kerry collins why do n't they throw the ball deep more why do n't they stick to the run when dayne is going good why do n't they throw more to the tight end but the offense this season is still vastly improved it is without question the best giants offense since phil simms 's last season in 1993 statistically it is the team 's best since 1985 this year 's team is averaging 3372 yards gained per game the most since the 1985 team averaged 3678 the giants redesigned offensive line consistently opens holes for the running backs does not commit many penalties and protects collins dayne is getting better and barber if he can just stay healthy is the most dangerous player on offense collins is maturing showing leadership and grit in difficult situations late in the game sunday with the crowd at fedex field in washington on its feet after the redskins only touchdown you could feel the giants wobbling collins dropped back on third down needing 9 yards no one was open and the crowd screeched because collins was about to be hit in the pocket collins thought he saw amani toomer breaking over the middle but he did not know if he had time to fire the ball in there how many recent giants quarterbacks from dave brown to danny kanell to kent graham would have taken a sack there all three collins later said of the sequence sometimes you 've just got to throw it he did it sailed just past toomer but joe jurevicius who was running the wrong route jumped over two redskins for the football first down how many recent giants wide receivers from thomas lewis to kevin alexander to david patten would have found a way to go up and make that play none the giants offense is getting better the giants defense meanwhile is already capable of playing with virtually any team in the conference it can not be overstated how commanding it was on sunday against a team whose offense had toyed with the giants in recent games the giants have one or two holes defensively but defensive tackle keith hamilton is playing well enough to be in the pro bowl michael strahan is coming on and free safety shaun williams is all over the field knocking people silly the giants have a future star in defensive lineman cornelius griffin and if jason sehorn can stay healthy he still has the talent to win a game by himself if their defense continues to solidify the giants will be a tough opponent for anyone when the season is over people may still be saying that the giants did not beat anyone good do not believe it the giants are a work in progress but one of the things they are good at is making other teams look bad or as coach jim fassel said in a perfectly idiosyncratic moment we force the other people not to play good too at times like these with the playoffs a heartbeat away it 's worth appreciating the art in that too

 yankees manager joe torre yesterday sent his beleaguered and aching veteran david cone to the bullpen for the second time this season likely ensuring that the pitcher would stay there for the rest of his devastating 2000 season and for the second time torre took cone 's old friend and former mets teammate dwight gooden out of the bullpen and put him into the rotation gooden will start in cone 's place tomorrow torre said that cone 's left shoulder which he dislocated sept 5 while diving for a bunt was still not 100 percent and that prompted the move cone has a career low 4 13 record and 655 earned run average this season you know with coney it 's more guts than anything else torre said we 're talking about enduring the pain and at this time maybe being in the bullpen is not asking him to do too much we 'll just reverse things a bit at this juncture we 're just doing it a start at a time torre said the only way cone would make a post season roster would be in the bullpen but even that is not a sure thing right now perhaps by making a few relief appearances torre said cone could help himself cone arrived at yankee stadium at 9 45 am yesterday hoping to talk to torre but he did not speak with his manager until about 11 am he accepted the news with professionalism torre said but cone sighed in disappointment when he discussed the demotion at his locker i knew all along that the chances were remote that i would get a playoff start cone said i could read the writing on the wall any chance i would have would be in the bullpen at the end of the staff that 's just the way it is and i have to get ready for that i have to prove i can still get hitters out it 's been a hellacious year for me but it ai n't over yet if i can help the team in just one game i 've got to be ready to do that in his last outing wednesday at toronto cone was shelled for six hits and seven runs in three and two thirds innings it was his second start since returning from his shoulder injury following a shaky outing against cleveland gooden relieved cone in toronto and was impressive allowing one earned run while striking out five in four and a third shutout innings cone 37 said that while his shoulder still causes him pain and inhibits his range of motion i can pitch through these things then he added i 'm not 20 anymore the future is now for me meanwhile gooden keeps reinventing himself he has virtually locked up a postseason spot on the roster even he sounded surprised there 's no way i could imagine any of this said gooden who at 35 was released by two teams this season before coming to the yankees in july the yankees principal owner george steinbrenner pushed for gooden to return to new york and the yankees started him in place of cone who went to the bullpen for the first time in the first of the cross town day night doubleheader against the mets in july gooden thought it would be a one shot deal i left my clothes in tampa he said with a laugh and then added i 've been more appreciative now than even in my rookie year when torre told him about tomorrow 's start gooden immediately went to cone me personally i wish cone would be the guy gooden said our friendship is a lot deeper than teammates but gooden has been more reliable this season whether coming out of the bullpen for 11 relief appearances or starting four games with the yankees he has a 281 earned average and is 4 1 at this stage in his career gooden is thrilled with his role of utility pitcher with the yankees i do n't know if i want to start again for another team gooden said i 've come to the conclusion where i want to end my career in new york whether it be this year or next cone said he will reevaluate his future after this season preferably after he pitches in whatever role in the postseason i have been throwing the ball reasonably well he said obviously joe will factor in my track record and hopefully that is going to help me get on the roster
 the conundrum facing the giants defensive coaches as they prepare to play the philadelphia eagles is this do they believe what they have seen with their own eyes or do they believe what they have seen on videotape from the rest of the eagles season because the eagles that the giants saw first hand were n't competitive those eagles were n't even competent but in their 15 other games with rare exceptions the eagles played exceedingly well so which eagles do the giants coaches prepare their team for which set of videotapes will provide the more telling lessons in how to beat the eagles eagles versus giants or eagles against everyone else do you judge an opponent at his worst or his best or does it matter what a team has done against someone else if they can not do it against you and if you 're the giants defensive coordinator john fox and you 've designed a defensive game plan that worked perfectly how do you change it or should you because it 's hard to overstate just how dominant the giants defense was against philadelphia in two games against the giants the eagles have held the football for only 37 minutes 35 seconds that might be a good possession time for one game for two games it 's unimaginable for a team that was heading for the playoffs against the giants the eagles converted only 4 of 21 third down opportunities or 19 percent for the rest of the season the eagles converted 42 percent against the giants the eagles averaged 2145 yards per game against the rest of their opponents 3269 yards so if you 're fox you change nothing and let your veteran defense win another cold weather playoff game for you right but suppose fox changes nothing in his approach to philadelphia and the eagles who will certainly try to alter their attack move the ball successfully against the giants wo n't everyone say fox was a dunce for not adjusting that 's exactly what everyone will say and if fox changes too much and the giants get out of sync and play poorly there 's a chance he will be criticized for tinkering with something that was n't broken in the two previous games the giants front four particularly defensive tackles keith hamilton and cornelius griffin has been too quick for the eagles offensive line linebackers jessie armstead and mike barrow have stuffed the running lanes even containing philadelphia 's magical quarterback donovan mcnabb the secondary has smothered the eagles unheralded wide receiving corps in the first giants eagles meeting a 33 18 giants victory cornerback jason sehorn had a game high eight tackles the other giants cornerback dave thomas had four tackles how do you mess with that kind of success well here 's how you study the eight games the eagles have played since they last saw the giants in a 24 7 loss on oct 29 the eagles lost only one of those games on a last ditch field goal by tennessee if you are the giants defensive coaches you realize that mcnabb has only 25 career starts in the national football league that means more than 30 percent of his nfl experience has come since he last played the giants that 's plenty of time to grow and significantly change as a player the giants may dominate the eagles in the same ways on sunday but it would be suicide to prepare for the same eagles team the giants saw in the two previous games as giants general manager ernie accorsi said yesterday you take away our two games with them and they 've had a tremendous season so you do n't prepare for the team that lost two lopsided games to your team but for the 11 5 team whose three other losses were by a total of 8 points you prepare for a team that manhandled an adept seasoned tampa bay defense last week there may be some risk altering a game plan that succeeded it is riskier to assume that the third game in this series will happen precisely as the two previous ones did besides the giants defense that finished the 2000 regular season is different and better than the one that played the eagles previously the giants defense now is more confident more willing and eager to blitz and especially capable of masking its weaknesses with cohesive play as a unit expect the giants defensive coaches this week to prepare a diverse varied game plan for shutting down the eagles which means shutting down mcnabb as elusive as mcnabb is it 's most unlikely the giants will be timid about attacking him expect the giants to blitz plenty secure in the belief that armstead barrow and free safety shaun williams are quick enough and sure enough tacklers to at least disrupt mcnabb an absolute key as it was when the teams played in september will be sehorn 's coverage of philadelphia 's primary wide receiver charles johnson with each blitz sehorn could easily be left in single coverage johnson caught five passes in the first meeting between the teams but no reception was longer than 9 yards until a 20 yard catch late in the game after sehorn had been replaced by second stringers mcnabb as good as he is is still in his second season in the league what the giants will plan to do is to confuse him with blitzes and coverages from new formations and sets it 's not so much what the giants will do differently it 's how they will look different doing it in the end the giants solution to their conundrum may be forcing mcnabb to believe what he sees with his eyes rather than what he has seen on videotape whoever succeeds in creating the most confusion wins

 people used to say they were busy busy busy now they say they 're multitasking in the olympics the decathlon is a sport in the office trying to do 10 things at once is a trial multitasking is the only task jenny mckinney of san francisco knows on sept 3 she and her husband bruce working with a staff of six people spread across seven states and working out of their homes established a database web site of bibliographies historical and current book auction records and prominent book dealer catalogs mr mckinney 's concept was to help dealers of rare books become more efficient by giving them quick access to titles and prices and to help book collectors by making them aware of titles on the market and price history libraries that have rare book collections would also benefit my husband 's motivation to start this business was that this was an extremely smart and logical concept mrs mckinney writes everyone ought to embrace it after the launch not only did dealers not like it libraries were indifferent to it and collectors are nowhere in sight within a month three staff members quit mrs mckinney writes i am on the job with the following multitasks in charge of bookkeeping payroll coding articles published monthly on our web site updating database maintaining an e mailing list designing promotional material and making date entries when i have free time additionally our web site is going through many phases of software additions and modifications mrs mckinney is responsible for ensuring that results are logical functional and otherwise user friendly during her free time she manages an investment portfolio for her sister and herself and is the mother of a 16 year old daughter and a 17 year old son my office is in the corner of our kitchen she says who do you think is doing the cooking laundry grocery shopping etc can i tell anyone that i am only one person so far no one has lent me his or her ears i hope you do every day i find myself doing something like checking e mail while talking on my office phone while unjamming the fax machines while trying to pick up the ringing cellphone susan hay cramer writes from missoula mont where she is a consultant on management and governance for local and national nonprofit organizations for me the biggest challenge in terms of job performance is balancing the time i spend marketing myself and my services with the time i spend doing the actual work for which organizations hire me she says my biggest reality check was realizing that about 50 percent of my time is unbillable no one pays me to buy office supplies or execute a dynamite marketing presentation or update my web site or unjam the fax machine but she adds i may be someone who thrives on multitasking so how does she handle it all i write down others would use a palm pilot i 'm sure absolutely everywhere i have to be everything i have to do and everyone i need to call because i 've learned the hard way that if i do n't write it down it does n't get done i carry a calendar both on my laptop my constant companion and a hard copy version in my purse and i 've learned also the hard way to compose all e mail to clients and prospects offline and then send it to avoid erroneous or embarrassing transmissions ms cramer says i 'd write more but i have a conference call with a client during which time i will also be sorting laundry and packing for a trip out of town henry dubroff had a dream in 1999 he was a business journalist working as the editor of the denver business journal his dream was to own a newspaper company so he quit his job and moved to santa barbara calif with a start up kit a leased saab a checkbook and a business plan today he is the chairman chief executive principal owner president publisher and editor of pacific coast business times which he describes as a thriving business journal that serves santa barbara ventura and san luis obispo counties one of his first lessons he writes was that our company 's success depended very heavily on my ability to multitask i have negotiated leases in the morning and edited real estate stories in the afternoon mr dubroff says i have sold ads over breakfast and written columns in the dead of night i have delivered newspapers and met the payroll and when the ad crunch hit in 2001 we had to let 6 of our 16 people go in order to keep the company afloat that was hard things are better now and my multitasking has evolved these days my most important job is to keep our team of 10 people happy and motivated job no 2 is to operate the company more or less within our budget but i have learned to make it fun recently i took the company credit card to one of santa barbara 's many thrift stores and for less than 25 i brought back 28 corningware plates and a mixed collection of stainless steel dinnerware that more or less serves 12 the result was a triple win first we will never again use paper plates at our semiregular company 'festivals second the new dishwasher that the landlord installed in the kitchen see lease negotiations above is being put to good use third the long term quality of life around the office has been kicked up a couple of notches for thousands of small business owners like me multitasking is n't just about doing e mail and voice mail at the same time that 's the easy stuff the hard stuff is doing whatever needs to be done to make the business go years ago when robin a kroft was looking for her first job after college in toronto a friend 's mother looked her squarely in the eye and said whatever you do never admit you know how to type as a woman you will always have more earning power that encounter says dr kroft who now lives in baltimore and whose expertise is in philanthropic studies occurred before keyboarding at a computer made acceptable the notion that brains and typing could go hand in hand dr kroft writes recently after the economy claimed a major donor it became necessary to downsize the research foundation where i am a vice president faced with the challenge of running a grant program without secretarial support i was pushed to call upon my closely held typing skills she said she had managed to teach herself how to create a special type of computerized letter that only the most revered support staff members had mastered i wanted to celebrate by taking myself out to lunch on secretary 's day she said except i did n't have time

 pete sampras 's decision this week to withdraw from the french open and wimbledon may signal the end of the most remarkable tennis career in the last 30 years but sampras 31 the winner of a record 14 grand slam singles titles is still not ready to say he is retiring he has not competed since september when he captured his 14th major title by defeating andre agassi in the final of the united states open sure we 've talked about it paul annacone his coach said yesterday by telephone he feels like ok andre agassi finals of the us open two year drought 26000 screaming fans it does n't get a whole lot better than that in terms of a resurgence and maybe an overall completion of the picture it 's like michael jordan hitting that last shot years ago against utah in a romantic way everyone says 'walk away it sounds terrific but in reality it remains to be seen we 'll see what not being at wimbledon does to him sampras gave himself some wiggle room for a possible return when he was interviewed by abc television during the lakers spurs playoff game thursday night i am not ready to close the door quite yet on my career he said sampras announced in february that he planned to return to competition this year but he has withdrawn from several tournaments he said this week that it was unlikely he would return for this year 's united states open annacone said sampras had been much more of a part time player in the last six weeks when annacone has focused more on sampras 's business activities than on his game it went to a couple times a week and he probably went one spell where he did n't hit for two to three weeks annacone said since then it 's been once or twice a week a casual 40 minutes just to keep the groove but sampras said he was not burning to prove himself again on the circuit he dominated for much of the 1990 's when i started the process of trying to play wimbledon i found that my heart was n't 100 percent into it he told abc it takes a lot of work and if your heart 's not into it it 's time to move on sampras said he chose not to retire now because he did not want to run the risk of changing his mind i do n't think he 'll pull a jordan or a lemieux patrick mcenroe the united states davis cup captain said yesterday by telephone that 's not his personality he 's stubborn in a way very thoughtful about the decisions he makes he 's very attuned to his place in tennis history and he 's not going to play if he does n't feel he can win and he wants to make sure that when he says he 's stopping he is really done annacone said sampras was adamant that the birth of his first child in november was not influencing his thinking about continuing his career it 's not 'i need to be home i have to be with my child annacone said it 's about 'am i ready to do this seven days a week with that focus that discipline that sacrifice annacone thinks this layoff just may generate its own challenge in the modern game no established star has won major titles after a long break maybe that will be intriguing to him he said

 the xfl pro wrestling 's prodigal football hybrid is close to making giants stadium the home of its new york area franchise putting games on the stadium 's new experimental grass field during february and march people familiar with the lease negotiations have said the new jersey sports and exposition authority owners of giants stadium and the world wrestling federation which created the league with the help of a 30 million investment from nbc have been talking for several weeks with the consent of the giants and the jets representatives for the authority and the wwf declined to comment on the negotiations other officials involved with the talks said the wwf was eager to play at giants stadium because of the credibility and visibility it would bring the fledging league and was also willing to pay for some of the field maintenance costs the authority would receive revenue during a period when the stadium has traditionally been dormant as part of their lease agreements the giants and the jets would receive a small percentage of the parking and concession profits for any professional football games at giants stadium the xfl is scheduled to begin play in eight cities on feb 3 2001 keeping the grass healthy was my initial concern said john mara the giants executive vice president referring to the grass tray field installed in march but i was assured it was going to be ok we do n't have any problem with them coming in after playing 24 football seasons on artificial turf the authority with the urging of the giants agreed last year to change to a permanent grass surface the metrostars of the major soccer league have been playing on a similar field for several years but for the first time this fall the giants and the jets are scheduled to play their regular season home games on grass the xfl presents the sports authority with an opportunity to maximize its potential for revenue and it 's our obligation and desire to cooperate said steve gutman the jets president our concerns about the field surface and facilities were discussed and addressed and we 're comfortable the field is actually a patchwork of more than 6000 plastic grass trays with a revolutionary subterranean engineering system that can heat cool feed and moisturize the grass the design includes a network of implanted computer sensors that adjust to the differing needs of the playing surface more heat for the parts in the shade less heat for the parts in the sun scott clark whose clark companies installed the field said he thinks the xfl players might be more comfortable playing on the field during bad weather the grass surface can be heated to nearly 60 degrees if you 're standing on that field the heat is going to radiate up through it clark said clark also said he could help the sports authority melt the snow that gathered in the grandstand before games if they could push it down to the sidelines he said we could melt it clark conceded that the current field was not planned with year round use in mind but the project did call for thousands of the grass trays in the center of the field to be replaced every six weeks beginning in september if the giants or the jets make the playoffs the plan was to replace the center of the field in january anyway clark said his field could melt up to three inches of snow as it was falling if a bigger storm was coming we would put a tarp over the field then plow it off and melt the snow on the sideline said clark whose company recently studied the last 40 years of winter weather readings at newark airport we 've been tinkering with all the possibilities and all the components were already in place so we 're ready although i guess you could say we 're pretty sure the car will run but we have n't started it yet the metrostars would be the first team to use the field after the xfl a metrostars spokesman said that nick sakiewicz the team 's general manager was traveling in florida yesterday sakiewicz could not be reached for comment

 to the editor regarding been up so long it looks like down nov 19 about empty stores in downtown millburn it would be easy to assume that the presence of an upscale mall in short hills or the many discount stores along route 22 have caused commercial property to go unoccupied in millburn but a more thorough analysis would lead one to conclude that it is a lack of vision on the part of downtown landlords and merchants and of the municipal government that are the real problems millburn is now involved in an effort to reinvent itself the cries most often heard are why ca n't we be like maplewood village or madison or why ca n't we get a big box store in here to draw people to the downtown the only chance for progress is for the various parties to acknowledge the downtown infrastructure with all its limitations this certainly did not happen under the last downtown alliance study proposal that actually wanted the city government to condemn certain parcels to add more commercial space what millburn can do is build upon the assets it does have like brokerage operations and financial institutions perhaps we can not get college students from a nearby campus to stroll in without cars as madison and south orange have done or create the downtown ambience of maplewood village but if various parties would look to make buildings smart buildings then perhaps we can attract more of the type of businesses that would compliment what is already downtown this may regenerate downtown or at the least bring us a cybercafe as for the abandoned saks site it would be terrific if the use could be redirected to a residential one or perhaps a satellite campus for a higher learning institution but that may be hoping for too much abbott gorin millburn
 less than a minute before halftime last night patrick ewing stole a chicago bulls pass and casually flipped a no look pass toward a teammate as if he were magic johnson but the ball landed in the hands of elton brand thwarting a fast break opportunity and making coach jeff van gundy wince eight seconds later allan houston made another steal and basically did the same thing blindly tossing a pass intended for latrell sprewell over halfcourt and into the hands of matt maloney van gundy arms folded and face taut as he stood on the sideline was clearly bothered by the consecutive displays of carelessness if a more capable opponent had been at madison square garden such absent mindedness might have cost the knicks but the bulls 13 54 are exceptionally bad so the home team prevailed despite its slack handling of the basketball the knicks aggressive defense and chicago 's offensive ineptness meshed for a drab 78 67 victory that enabled the knicks to win after two straight defeats to the league 's conference leaders the los angeles lakers and the indiana pacers we played awful offensively but we played extremely hard defensively said van gundy whose team held chicago to just 26 second half points and 36 percent shooting over all we just could n't pass or catch tonight the ball was all over the place perhaps a subpar performance should have been expected given the knicks custom of struggling on the second night of back to back games the victory which began less than 24 hours after their tough 4 point loss at indiana improved their record in such contests to 4 11 highlight material or not though the victory meant plenty it improved the knicks record to 41 26 and left them two games ahead of toronto and philadelphia both 39 28 in the fight for third place in the eastern conference playoff race the knicks who play host to the atlanta hawks tomorrow need to create as much space as possible between them and their chasers before embarking on a brutal five game trek through the western conference that begins sunday in portland and includes contests against sacramento seattle vancouver and the los angeles lakers while the hawks are far from a juggernaut they have been too much for the knicks to handle defeating them in each of this season 's two previous meetings despite the knicks effectiveness on defense chris childs who finished with 2 points and 4 assists in 25 minutes said an effort like last night 's will not be enough in most ballgames we have to get back to enjoying each other and enjoying the game of basketball childs said we 're out there like mummies not acknowledging each other it 's the time of the season where it 's either now or never besides holding the bulls to an opponent low point total for the season the most pleasing aspect of the game for the knicks had to be the sight of marcus camby sprinting and leaping without hindrance camby who returned five games ago from a strained anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee banged the knee hard in the late moments against indiana and was limping afterward but last night on his 26th birthday there were no major signs of a problem he was not dominant but he was not bad recording 10 points and 9 rebounds in an active effort the knee is holding up said camby who flinched in pain once while on the court it is pretty fine we 'll rest it up tomorrow and get ready for friday the comfort level is not there and the stability is not there for me to stop on a dime but i felt fine tonight sprewell was perhaps the only knick playing near the top of his game he got the knicks started right with 8 first quarter points and put them ahead by 43 33 late in the second quarter by dropping consecutive midrange jumpers he made 7 of his first 8 shots and took 15 of his team high 21 points into the locker room at intermission where the knicks sat on a 47 41 lead that the advantage was not bigger was a testament to the magnitude of the knicks offensive slumber as they failed to capitalize on chicago 's horrendous start the bulls losers of 8 straight games and 16 of their last 17 outings missed their first 12 shots going without a made field goal for the opening 6 minutes 36 seconds once chicago got going though it rode the strength of brand the rookie power forward to competitiveness brand used a nice arsenal of post moves to score 17 of his game high 22 points and get three fouls apiece on kurt thomas and camby in the first half rebounds the queens native ron artest a rookie small forward for the bulls had a poor outing going scoreless in 32 minutes artest a st john 's product whom knicks coach jeff van gundy wanted to draft last summer entered the game with season averages of 119 points and 43 rebounds patrick ewing played with the flu scoring 12 points and grabbing 9 rebounds
 tim carter bounced up from the sideline certain he had made the catch that would turn around his fortunes in the giants offense it was the fourth quarter of monday night 's game against dallas just after the giants tied the score at 29 29 and seized the momentum quarterback kerry collins had thrown to carter deep on first down a ball he dived for and thought he had caught at the cowboys 26 it would have been a huge play and far more significant than the 34 yards it would have gained when the officials signaled no catch carter threw up his arms and argued giants coach jim fassel challenged the call to no avail though carter had his feet inbounds he was juggling the ball as he fell maybe if there were a few more inches or the rules were a little bit different the play would have gone a different way and everything would be in a different light carter said but in the harsh light of a big moment it wound up like many plays for carter this season agonizingly close to being wonderful he seems just a few inches from becoming the dangerous and dependable third receiver the giants need with ron dixon out with a knee injury carter sees the opportunity before him the giants like to run three receiver sets it was their most effective formation against dallas partly because teams like to blanket receivers amani toomer and ike hilliard the third wide receiver is going to draw their third best corner and if your third guy is better than their third guy it 's going to be to your advantage collins said he can be that guy for us and i think he will be carter is blessed with great speed good size 6 feet 200 pounds and talent that the giants coaches can not wait to mold into an offensive weapon he was a second round draft choice out of auburn in 2002 but his rookie season was a frustrating injury plagued one he finally seemed ready to break out taking the place of the injured hilliard in two games but he tore his right achilles tendon in the ninth game and was lost for the rest of the season he made an impressively quick comeback and worked so hard in the off season that the receivers coach jimmy robinson was stunned at how much he had learned without playing the big hurdle was doing what he had learned in games carter made a few of those infuriatingly close plays in the preseason letting passes slip off his fingertips or not keeping his feet inbounds but fassel remained determined to keep trying to get him the ball collins threw to him nine times against the cowboys he caught 3 passes for 28 yards not all the incompletions were his fault collins said he could have thrown a better ball on that fourth quarter pass but it was still catchable we 've got to have him make those plays for us fassel said he 's a talent i like him fassel 's and collins 's eyes light up when talking about carter his misses have not yet swayed their opinion his potential still outshines the mistakes the biggest mistake we can make is not throw to him or not play him robinson said he 's just got to get out there and play i have n't lost any confidence in him carter says he has not lost confidence in himself either he is happy for the chance to work with and learn from toomer and hilliard he says he is thrilled the giants want to use a three receiver set more than they did last season he just wants to get his hands on the ball to earn the trust of collins in key situations carter said i can see ike and kerry ike is given the option to freelance sometimes to do his own thing but their timing is so impressive it 's amazing how they 're on the same page they 're thinking the same thing kerry anticipates well anyway his ball placement he does that naturally but some plays you think how did they do that carter is learning sometimes the hard way extra points defensive end keith hamilton is still questionable with a hamstring injury all the other regulars practiced friday including left tackle luke petitgout and are expected to play
 the heating system is an important factor to consider when buying or building a new home the system is in two parts the heat producing unit and the machinery that distributes the heat throughout the house while it is important to consider both components when evaluating a heating system the distribution system is a little more important and it should be considered first the most common system in north america is forced air heating a furnace first heats air then a fan pumps the hot air through metal ducts to floor registers in various rooms in the house the incoming air creates a pressure differential that forces cooler air into return registers and ducts channel it back to the furnace for reheating and recirculation forced air systems deliver heat quickly and are easy to integrate with other climate control systems like air conditioners humidifiers dehumidifiers and air filters the drawback of a forced air system is that heat can be lost through the duct walls if they are not wrapped with insulation in addition the duct seals may deteriorate over time and allow air to leak out also it is difficult to set up zones for heating different parts of the house separately sometimes this can be accomplished by selectively closing dampers in the ducts but it takes time to do this properly another disadvantage to the forced air system is that the air handler and blower unit can be noisy especially with older units a good forced air system should be designed to fit the house so the air flow is not obvious this can be accomplished only if the air handler is the correct size and the registers are positioned where they will be the most effective another popular heating system is baseboard hydronic heating in this system water is heated in a boiler and then pumped through pipes to baseboard radiators throughout the house this type of heating offers quiet operation and relatively little heat loss through the distribution system leaks are rare but if they do occur the hot water can cause major damage to floors and walls air pressure imbalances are not a problem and it is relatively easy to configure this type of system for zoned heating the main disadvantages to hydronic heating systems are they can not be adapted to accommodate other climate control systems and the installation costs can be high also the heaters along the baseboards can interfere with furniture placement radiant floor heating is another type of hot water heating system the heating element consists of specialized rubber or plastic tubing embedded in a concrete slab under the floor and the water or a water antifreeze mix heated by a boiler turns the entire floor into a radiator a radiant floor system can provide a high level of comfort because it gives uniform heat across the entire floor surface but it takes time to heat a cold room with radiant floor heating because the heating elements must warm up a large slab of concrete before the heat can rise to the room above it is also expensive to put in and requires the skills of trained designers and installers since the heating element is embedded in the floor slab radiant floor heating is only practical for single level houses another type of heating is called direct space heating this is not a distribution system because it consists of individual heating units positioned throughout the house the heat is generated where it is used typical space heaters include kerosene heaters portable electric heaters and wood  or gas fired fireplaces in a modern home these are auxiliary heating systems at best and are used by most homeowners to supplement another heating system the main disadvantage to space heaters is that they use combustible fuels with the exception of electric heaters and unless they are vented properly they can introduce noxious gases into the home there is one type of space heater however that qualifies as a heating system it is electric baseboard heating each unit generates the heat at the point of use so it can be considered to be a space heater but because the heaters extend throughout the house they can also be considered to be a whole house heating system installation costs for this system are low but depending on electric rates operation costs can be higher than for other systems
 most of the sites where the federal government built nuclear bombs will never be cleaned up enough to allow public access to the land and the plan for guarding sites that are permanently contaminated is inadequate the national academy of sciences said today in a report at many sites radiological and nonradiological hazardous wastes will remain posing risks to humans and the environment for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years the report said complete elimination of unacceptable risks to humans and the environment will not be achieved now or in the foreseeable future the idea that the production of nuclear weapons has produced national sacrifice zones land that the public can never use again is not new the term became common in environmental circles in the late 1980 's when the united states began recognizing the environmental legacy of the manhattan project the effort during world war ii to develop atomic weapons and the cold war but the report commissioned by the department of energy goes a step further it says that the government can try to declare certain areas permanently off limits but that it lacks the technology money and management techniques to prevent the contamination from spreading in addition some of the contaminants have already migrated outside plant boundaries and others will follow the report said thomas m leschine the chairman of the committee that wrote the report said managers could use barbed wire and guards at the sites but dr leschine an associate professor in the school of marine affairs at the university of washington added there 's no assurance that we can maintain any of that control it 's one thing to put a fence up around something but it 's really something else to maintain it in perpetuity controls on the use of some of the land are already breaking down the report said for example in the early 1990 's the department of energy sold land near its oak ridge reservation in tennessee for use as a golf course stipulating that the groundwater was contaminated and was not to be used within a few years however doe discovered that a well was being drilled to irrigate the golf course the report said dr leschine said the committee had found another case in which the department of energy had posted no fishing signs at a creek near oak ridge because of radiation contamination in the water the signs all got stolen because the local high school kids thought they were nice things to have he said then there were months of protracted battles between the local authorities and the department of energy over whose responsibility it was to replace the signs at the department of energy gerald g boyd the deputy assistant secretary for science and technology said his agency established a long term stewardship office a year ago to cope with the problem with about a dozen people working with engineers and planners at the various sites the office was established soon after the department requested the study from the national academy of sciences mr boyd said the department has accelerated its clean up efforts reduce the costs involved and minimize risks to surrounding communities but a perfect cleanup is not possible he said as an example of the breakdown of control dr leschine cited the fire that endangered the los alamos national laboratory in new mexico in may the fire set the stage for mud slides in the coming rainy season that could contaminate the rio grande with radioactive and chemical toxins from the laboratory but the cause of the blaze was not natural or malicious the fire was set by another government agency as part of its land management efforts the report said that no plan written now to minimize the spread of uncontained wastes would suffice over the tens hundreds or even thousands of years that some of the contaminants would remain dangerous it urged the department to assume that engineered barriers like concrete and steel would eventually fail and that most of what was known about the behavior of contaminants in air soil or water might eventually be proven wrong the department needs a long term program that actively seeks out and applies new knowledge the report said the report identified 144 sites where the department and its predecessors notably the atomic energy commission processed nuclear materials and it said that 109 would not be cleaned up enough for unrestricted release because of insufficient money technical skill or political will to do the job
 joseph coors sr who helped make his family 's beer a nationwide brand and who used his fortune to support conservative causes notably the heritage foundation and ronald reagan 's climb to the presidency died on saturday at his home in rancho mirage calif where he had moved in retirement he was 85 and formerly lived in golden colo the cause was lymphatic cancer his company said a grandson of the company 's founder adolph coors joe coors was a former president chief operating officer and vice chairman of the adolph coors company based in golden he retired from management in 1987 and from the company board in 2000 with his elder brother william mr coors challenged the industry giants anheuser busch and miller brewing for their national position until the 1970 's coors beer was a regional western beer selling around 300000 barrels a year going national the coors brothers produced more than 20 million barrels annually by the time joe coors retired from the business the growth which made coors the country 's third largest beer producer did not come without its detractors coors 's nonunion policies drew the ire of organized labor and a long and bitter boycott that was eventually ended in the late 1980 's and coors money aroused controversy when it spilled into the political arena in the 1970 's joseph coors lent his influence and financial power to start the heritage foundation a conservative research institute in washington with an initial gift of 250000 within 10 years with the help of much larger contributions from other conservative businessmen notably richard mellon scaife the foundation had an annual budget of more than 10 million and was supporting influential studies by more than 100 scholars and researchers without joe coors the heritage foundation would n't exist its president edwin feulner said and the conservative movement it nurtures would be immeasurably poorer he also became a mainstay of an array of other conservative bodies like the free congress foundation the mountain states legal foundation and the leadership institute training grounds for politically ambitious young conservatives with its headquarters in arlington va mr coors met mr reagan in palm springs calif in 1967 and promptly enlisted in the campaign to propel mr reagan then the new california governor into the white house by 1980 he was a key member of mr reagan 's inner circle that guided his transition team and helped determine the makeup of his administration mr coors was a strong supporter of several coloradans who won reagan appointments including james g watt the president of the mountain states legal foundation who became secretary of the interior and anne m gorsuch a denver lawyer who became head of the environmental protection agency joseph coors was born in golden and raised in the shadow of the family brewery where he did odd jobs during summer breaks he attended public schools and graduated with a degree in chemistry from cornell university in 1940 he also received a master 's degree in chemical engineering at cornell in 1942 the year he was named to the board of adolph coors in 1946 he took charge of the company 's porcelain division which had helped it survive prohibition he worked in the clay pits outside golden and was credited with innovations in producing ceramics the company which now makes ceramic components for technical uses like electrical systems was spun off and is now called coorstek his chemical engineering background also came in handy when he and his brother refined the company 's cold filtered brewing technology the brothers also had a role in the introduction of aluminum beer cans and later in recycling them when coors began to offer a penny for each can 's return in 1959 long before recycling became a nationwide priority besides his brother mr coors is survived by his wife anne and the five sons from his first marriage to holly coors of golden jeffrey h peter h now the chairman of coors joseph jr grover and john all of golden 27 grandchildren and 8 great grandchildren
 even though the season 's opener between the jets and the washington redskins is almost six months away the game is starting to look like a sequel to an off season slugging match between the teams in the latest round the jets complained to the national football league that the redskins made an illegal offer to their top wide receiver laveranues coles the redskins have already plucked right guard randy thomas and place kicker john hall from the jets as free agents they also tried to acquire kick returner chad morton but the jets matched the redskins offer on thursday allowing them to keep morton now they are asking the league to look into the redskins seven year 35 million offer to coles as first reported on cbssportslinecom yesterday the redskins are accused of having offered coles the contract last sunday but not reporting it to the league until wednesday league rules require that a team report an agreement immediately by not doing so a team could tie up a player without a contract the redskins apparently needed the extra time to free salary cap space before coles signed the offer sheet which included a 13 million signing bonus a league spokesman greg aiello declined to comment but generally if a news report is significantly in error the league rebuts it the jets general manager terry bradway said of coles 's offer sheet we have until wednesday to make a decision if we want to match it coles 's agent roosevelt barnes jr could not be reached yesterday according to cbssportslinecom the redskins did not have enough cap money available to sign coles to the offer sheet on sunday night the team waited until wednesday before sending the signed agreement to the league and then faxed it that night to the jets if the nfl determines that the redskins violated the rules it is not certain that the redskins would lose coles the jets could also make the whole issue moot by matching the offer but if the offer is upheld and the jets do not match it they would receive the redskins first round draft pick the 13th over all the jets and the redskins open the season on sept 4

things here andre agassi you see him on tv he 's hot russia it is colder reaction americans like hot things we do n't have 100 programs in russia it 's only in the united states you have 100 channels of course in the hotel there are 20 channels but also pay tv here it 's tv tv tv here ratings are used to measure a sport 's worth for years agassi and pete sampras have been the pontoons for the popularity of men 's tennis today the united states open begins with the tantalizing possibility of a sampras agassi semifinal next week but the life span of this rivalry is nearing its end no one seems inspired to fill the void there have been six no 1 's in this year 's atp champions race a system that was designed to create fan interest by counting results from jan 1 that has actually left fans more confused than ever still the system aside no player has performed consistently enough to be a favorite to reach the open final much less capture the public 's imagination if the tiger woods phenomenon has reinforced anything it is that people are mesmerized by domination as if to manufacture a star on the tour and do it before an american audience over the next two weeks the atp has begun a campaign new balls please to promote the next generation yesterday spain 's juan carlos ferrero ecuador 's nicolas lapentti germany 's tommy haas and brazil 's gustavo kuerten were escorted into an interview room and lined up as tightly as piano keys for pictures and questions pete and andre are the guys that make things happen haas said we are like they say the next generation we 're young guys we still have a lot to learn with time hopefully we 're going to be the next people to talk about the colorful kuerten with his bandanna blond curls and barbed wire physique is the one voted most likely to succeed but if kuerten a two time french open winner is to advance his popularity in america he will have to perform on a hard court and get through a tricky draw in his quarter patrick rafter a two time winner at this event and mark philippoussis are looming kuerten has personality and he 's well liked the television analyst john mcenroe said he 's got a lot of drive you do n't see the other guys are unpredictable pete and andre are still going to be there for a couple of years but there are not a lot of other guys right now safin is one of the unknown variables after a forgettable 5 11 start to the season and through 48 rackets broken during fits of frustration the 6 foot 4 inch safin has won 40 of his last 50 matches to usher him toward a coming out party at the open he has a favorable path in his quarter of the draw with third seeded magnus norman posing the major threat safin of course does not want to discuss his fortuitous draw you know how many guys think this is their moment he said all 128 want to win and become a star although he is resistant to the characterization safin has star qualities he has a sense of humor that squeezes through the cracks in his unpolished english and a powerful game that at times falls short on control he is talented and tanned but sometimes appears to be teetering on a philippoussis like line for several years the australian 's performance was diluted by his fast paced bachelor 's life safin believes his night life is within the norm usually at night i like to have a drink or have a beer safin said but right now when i 'm at tournaments i have to stay in my room and try to do things in the right way and i have to be nice to myself get rest on most days he likes to sleep until noon on friday a prank call awoke safin at 9 am and it was hard to recover but even in a weary state safin was eager to discuss any subject from politics to poverty and when asked about his budding popularity he did not seem moved by the hype if anything he knows humility safin grew up in moscow during political upheaval when tennis balls were considered a luxury item it was a difficult time he said there was nothing in the shops it was difficult to find even good cheese and to get sugar was a big problem if you do n't have shops that have food how are you going to have tennis balls and rackets how could he develop at all when safin was 14 his parents made the difficult decision to pack their son 's belongings and send him to spain although he lived with a sponsor and trained with a coach safin was lonely and too poor to join his friends at restaurants of course at the beginning you say 'where 's my family where 's my mother where 's my father and my sister safin said but after a few weeks you start to become a normal person you realize this is it this is how the career started for safin this was the beginning for one member of tennis 's generation next just how familiar the public becomes with his story will unfold this week if grand slam fame strikes safin will not give stardom a second thought why should you have to prepare for it he said you move to another level raise your ranking but you are still living in the same world you walk on the street with everyone with the people maybe there is a lot of media a lot of attention but so what nothing should change

 when bubba carpenter was announced as a pinch hitter in the 11th inning last night the mere mention of his name caused some fans at shea stadium to giggle bubba what kind of name is bubba who is bubba they yelled to bubba they chanted his name and they teased the rookie well the fans teased carpenter for one pitch because bubba hammered turk wendell 's second pitch over the right field fence to propel the rockies to a 4 3 victory over the mets in 11 draining innings at shea stadium it was carpenter 's first major league homer it came at an opportune time for colorado and it came at an even more opportune time for a player who had spent nine depressing years in the minor leagues i did n't hear any of what they said but it does n't surprise me he said i do n't think there are too many bubbas running around the streets of new york city if fans were asked if they thought mike piazza or carpenter would get the game winning hit last night 99 percent would have guessed piazza piazza is a perennial all star and a future hall of famer while carpenter is a career minor leaguer but piazza had a chance to end the game in the 10th inning when the mets had runners on first and second and he smacked a hard grounder off julian tavarez to squander that opportunity that handed a first in a lifetime chance to the 31 year old carpenter who had spent his entire career in the yankees organization before signing with the rockies this season carpenter smacked wendell 's 1 0 fastball toward the mets bullpen and sprinted around the bases as if he were trying to score a touchdown spending the last five full years at class aaa columbus will do that finally after 922 minor league games and 3035 minor league at bats the affable guy named bubba had homered in the majors carpenter called shea one of the most beautiful ballparks he had ever seen which would be true since he had only seen two and he could not stop smiling as he discussed last night 's homer it was such a high feeling said carpenter who was even a replacement player with the yankees in 1995 you 're not thinking about anything you 're so high as soon as i hit i just said 'get out of the yard please it 's actually easy to hit in that situation because of the adrenaline if you ca n't hit in that situation you 're dead you need to be six feet under it is only may so the mets 20 20 are not six feet under but they lost for the 13th time in 19 games and wasted a solid performance by rick reed reed allowed two earned runs and struck out 10 in seven innings but his throwing error also led to colorado 's third run the mets rallied from a 3 1 deficit against masato yoshii on piazza 's run scoring groundout in the fourth and todd zeile 's homer in the seventh but there were numerous opportunities that the mets fumbled while going 0 for 6 with men in scoring position against their former teammate yoshii pitched seven innings and gave up three earned runs we misfired a little mets manager bobby valentine said we had chances and they always seemed to be with two outs after robin ventura 's homer tied the score 1 1 in the second jeffrey hammonds had a one out single in the fourth reed focused too much on the runner and his throw to first slithered under zeile 's glove for a two base error with the infield in reed wound up talking to himself after darren bragg hit a 200 foot blooper into center bragg stole second and scored on brent mayne 's single to left giving colorado a 3 1 lead the mets tied the score in the seventh but piazza could not end the game in the 10th and carpenter could an inning later the outfielder who was recalled from class aaa colorado springs when larry walker the 1997 most valuable player went on the disabled list had a chance he held the ball after the game not sure if he would send it to his father bill or keep it it had been a long wait for bubba i 'm playing ball carpenter said describing his perseverance it 's a game it 's fun i still love coming to the ballpark every day if i had to play another nine years to get to the big leagues i 'd do it inside pitch darryl hamilton who had surgery eight days ago to shave down both bone spurs and a joint in his left big toe was in a much happier mood than he had been before the 45 minute procedure it was good to have that done he said it gave me a little peace of mind to know i 'm going to be ok that was something i did n't know a couple of weeks ago i thought if i had surgery i might be out the whole season the 35 year old center fielder hopes to start running in two weeks and rejoin the mets in five weeks even though the braves enjoy a seven game bulge over the mets fred wilpon said his team should not gaze at the wild card standing i think we have to try to overtake the braves he said after not starting for four straight games because of an inflamed right shoulder shortstop rey ordonez returned and made several strong throws bobby j jones who has disabled with a strained right calf muscle will return to the rotation and start tomorrow

 it has become as familiar to knicks fans as latrell sprewell 's cornrows you see it every week if not every game it is the sight of kurt thomas the knicks growling power forward complaining to a referee about a foul call before stomping angrily toward the bench usually midway through the first quarter thomas has a new theory why he is always being whistled for infractions the referees he says are out to get him i think it 's obvious thomas said today before the knicks flew to cleveland for friday 's game against the cavaliers i think if you just look at the tape you see some bad calls called on me but i do n't worry about it i just give them an ugly look say a few words and then go the other way perhaps thomas should start worrying about it because the foul problems that have plagued him throughout his seven year career are worse than ever thomas averaged 33 minutes a game through the first 20 games this season but his reckless fouling has dropped his playing time to an average of 247 minutes over the last eight games he has averaged just 78 points and 65 rebounds during that stretch after fouling out twice in the first 20 games thomas has fouled out twice in the last four the knicks 13 15 were fortunate to overcome thomas 's foul woes in tuesday 's 102 94 victory over toronto in which he fouled out in just 20 minutes but with clarence weatherspoon about two weeks away from returning from a partially torn tendon in his right foot and center marcus camby battling foot problems the knicks will have trouble winning if thomas spends too much time on the bench camby who missed tuesday 's game with a sore left foot said today that he would play against cleveland he did not practice today and is still experiencing soreness but with the help of some anti inflammatory pills he said he hoped to fight through the pain i just try not to think about it just go out there and play said camby who has two swollen bones on the bottom of his foot when i feel right i 'm going to play and play well so i 'm looking forward tomorrow to playing well the knicks will need both camby and thomas near the tops of their games against cleveland the cavaliers are only 11 17 but they are not nearly as bad as their record when their 7 foot 3 inch center zydrunas ilgauskas is healthy ilgauskas who has been hampered by foot problems his whole career has played the last 11 games averaging 13 points 49 rebounds and 19 minutes a game he made his first start in wednesday 's 91 89 loss to the nets and had 15 points and 12 rebounds in a season high 25 minutes the 7 footer chris mihm started beside ilgauskas coach don chaney is thinking of starting thomas on ilgauskas so camby can give help and block shots while coming over from the weak side of course that plan will go nowhere if thomas can not stay out of foul trouble chaney said thomas was not exaggerating about the officials chaney said he believed the officials probably do n't like thomas in large part because of thomas 's frowning and complaining after calls if you 're a good defender you 've got to be able to have a relationship with the referees where if you think they did n't make a call you can walk over to them in a polite manner and say that was a bad call or whatever chaney said then you may get some sympathy the next time but you ca n't just go and jump down a guy 's throat because that angers him and then you 're not going to get any benefits from that point on but thomas said he was not about to start smiling at the officials that 's kind of hard for me because i do n't really smile that much thomas said partly in jest the only time i might smile is when i 'm with my family when i 'm with my kids i ca n't change the way i play i 'm going to always play aggressive and i 'm going to always play hard and if i pick up tick tack fouls i pick up tick tack fouls after replacing the retired larry johnson in the starting lineup thomas was expected to have a big season but he is averaging only 101 points 84 rebounds and shooting a paltry 432 percent i have n't had a good game all year said thomas who has season highs of 17 points and 13 rebounds as soon as i get like a 20 point and 14  or 15 rebound game then i 'll think i 'm having a good game but until then i 'm not playing well i 'm struggling it 's been a tough year for me pro basketball

 for the nets to visit the compaq center and have their victory plans foiled by a houston rockets big man is nothing new hakeem olajuwon one of the greatest centers in the history of the game has been doing that for years but for the final 20 minutes of today 's tight and tense contest the 37 year old olajuwon was on the bench with asthma like symptoms even so the rockets inside dominance continued as olajuwon 's understudy kelvin cato turned a game that seemed to be evolving into a nets victory into a costly defeat cato a 6 foot 11 inch center who averages 88 points and 61 rebounds a game eclipsed his scoring average in the last 6 minutes 25 seconds scoring 9 of his 11 points grabbing 4 of his 7 rebounds and recording 3 of his 5 blocks in that span cato led the rockets to a 99 92 overtime victory over the nets his biggest basket came on a ferocious two handed dunk with the nets rookie evan eschmeyer draped over his shoulders with 1 03 left in overtime just a 61 percent foul shooter cato sank the ensuing free throw to give the rockets a 95 92 lead that the nets would never cut into kelvin cato came up with some big dunks nets forward kendall gill said i think he was the key toward the end that was it right there those two words his name cato 's performance stalled the ascent of the nets who were led by stephon marbury 's 35 points and 6 assists in the eastern conference playoff race with 2 42 left in the fourth quarter the nets 24 35 led by 5 points and looked to be headed back to new jersey with at least three road victories now they must upset the defending champion san antonio spurs on monday to finish the five game trip above 500 while cato took advantage of eschmeyer at the end the nets rookie played admirably grabbing a career best nine rebounds and blocking two shots in 28 minutes his large amount of playing time was the result of a lower back bruise that limited jim mcilvaine to 12 minutes though coach don casey and the nets praised eschmeyer 's overall performance eschmeyer was disappointed after kerry kittles 17 points failed to answer cato 's 3 point play by missing a 13 footer with 463 seconds left eschmeyer fouled cuttino mobley near halfcourt it was eschmeyer 's sixth foul and sent casey into a rage because casey did not want the nets to foul in that situation mobley one of six rockets in double figures with 14 points made both free throws to make it 97 92 we 're not going to foul then casey said i do n't know where he got it in his mind he 's not a designated fouler anyway he just brain locked when you 've got five you do n't foul but he was confused and he 's a rookie but for a rookie he did a pretty good job eschmeyer said we had every chance to win and obviously i was involved in a big play down the stretch i messed up i cost us big down the stretch i 've been playing the game my whole life and i should know better than that the nets should have put houston 24 35 away in regulation they struggled early but marbury who shot 14 of 26 from the field on the strength of 10 layups kept them in it with 27 points through three quarters keith van horn 24 points 12 rebounds and kittles provided help in the fourth quarter with 6 points apiece and the nets held two 6 point leads in the final eight minutes but after hitting their first 16 free throws they missed 3 of their last 6 in the fourth quarter marbury made 1 of 2 foul shots to put the nets ahead 82 77 with 2 42 left but confusion in their defensive rotations left shandon anderson open for a 3 pointer then gill missed a jumper and the rockets tied the game on two free throws by kenny thomas behind cato houston took an 86 84 lead when marbury missed a 3 pointer on the next possession the nets seemed through but eschmeyer grabbed the rebound and fed marbury who drove to hit a 6 foot running jumper with 15 seconds left to send the game into overtime the nets led by 90 88 early in the extra session but cato who was 3 of 3 from the foul line had 5 points as the rockets finished with an 11 2 run rebounds coach rudy tomjanovich who led the rockets to national basketball association titles in 1994 and 1995 had a four year contract extension made official before the game the extension will begin in the 2001 2002 season the nets were outrebounded by 53 37 but jamie feick the team 's leading rebounder played only 13 minutes and had one rebound
 when rod thorn the president of the nets emerged from the team 's draft strategy room wednesday night his face was resolute but he seemed drained from the moves he had made as it turned out that was only a preview for yesterday 's blockbuster deal that sent stephon marbury to phoenix for jason kidd they may not have ended up with shooting guard jason richardson who was drafted fifth over all by golden state or kept forward eddie griffin but in the end the nets received something better three versatile talents to fit their needs we went into the draft last night trying to get accomplished exactly what we accomplished and those were the guys we were trying to get thorn said yesterday when thorn traded griffin the nets pick at no 7 to houston for the rights to the rockets three first round picks he then directed houston to select arizona swingman richard jefferson stanford center jason collins and pepperdine guard brandon armstrong the nets lacked a cohesive identity during a dismal injury ravaged 26 56 season the sixth time in seven years they missed the playoffs after selecting brian scalabrine a power forward out of southern california with the 35th pick the nets were left wondering whether they wagered quality for quantity i feel we got more potential quality at a number of positions thorn said i feel good about that we accomplished what we wanted to do everybody was happy with the way things worked out the three for one deal was contingent on the surprise of griffin dropping to no 7 but one eastern conference league executive said that the nets were inclined to make a trade to receive jefferson collins and armstrong anyway we had him going in the top three houston general manager carroll dawson said on their wish list the rockets had griffin ranked first or second but dawson said he never even brought up griffin 's name in predraft discussions with thorn to trade the three picks thinking it was a moot point so did thorn i was a bit surprised yes i thought he would go to golden state thorn said of griffin the warriors instead drafted richardson spoiling the nets hopes and fueling houston 's we had known that they wanted a certain person but if they could not get that person they might be better off with three picks dawson said unable to take richardson and knowing that the grizzlies would select shane battier thorn gambled that houston would be interested working without a deal but knowing from discussions he had leading up to the draft that the rockets were willing to unload their first round picks thorn made his selection in houston dawson picked up the phone do we have something to talk about dawson recalled thorn asking we sure do dawson responded within 10 minutes the rockets had agreed to the trade the teams kept a phone line open so thorn could tell the rockets which players to draft the rockets were not scared off by griffin 's history of fights with teammates stretching from his senior year at roman catholic high school in philadelphia to seton hall in january when griffin was suspended for a game after punching ty shine it did n't bother us i ca n't speak for the other teams dawson said you do your background checks and we got nothing but good reports jefferson 's stock had been rising among league executives based on his strong workouts and his late season performance in the ncaa tournament jefferson a junior led the wildcats to the ncaa championship game shooting 50 percent and averaging 135 points and 67 rebounds he held richardson and illinois point guard frankie williams to a combined 15 points and 5 of 26 shooting there are n't a whole lot of better athletes than richard and this year he became our defensive stopper arizona coach lute olsen said of jefferson on wednesday night thorn said he could see jefferson making an immediate impact playing small forward and shooting guard providing insurance if shooting guard kerry kittles can not fully recover from knee surgery i think he was one of the best athletes in the draft thorn said collins at 7 feet 260 pounds will vie for a starting position at center the nets started the second year player evan eschmeyer in 51 games with jim mcilvaine out for most of the season because of a calf injury the nets did not bring in collins for a workout figuring he would go in the second round although they did bring in his twin jarron jarron collins was selected by the utah jazz with the 53rd pick jason is considered the more polished of the two thorn saw jason at the chicago combine and was impressed with his toughness and his touch he can shoot the ball and he 's a big strong kid who plays very hard thorn said because of two years of medical redshirts jason collins still had two years of eligibility but he graduated from stanford 11 days ago with a degree in economics he had a frayed meniscus cartilage in his freshman year and dislocated his right wrist his sophomore year but he did not miss a game in his last two seasons during this process i did eight workouts in eight straight days flying from city to city never once taking a day off collins said my knee was fine it has n't bothered me all season for the past three seasons in armstrong thorn sees a reserve shooting guard who can eventually learn to play backup point guard as it turns out he will be backing up kidd

 philip f berrigan the former roman catholic priest who led the draft board raids that galvanized opposition to the vietnam war in the late 1960 's died last night in baltimore after a lifetime of battling the american empire as he called it over the morality of its military and social policies he was 79 his family said the cause was liver and kidney cancer the associated press reported an army combat veteran sickened by the killing in world war ii mr berrigan came to be one of the most radical pacifists of the 20th century and for a time in the vietnam period a larger than life figure in the convulsive struggle over the country 's direction in the late 60 's he was a catholic priest serving a poor black parish in baltimore and seeing nothing that would change his conviction that war racism and poverty were inseparable strands of a corrupt economic system his josephite superiors had previously hustled him out of newburgh ny for aggressive civil rights and antiwar activity there the fatal blow he said had been a talk to a community affairs council in which he asked is it possible for us to be vicious brutal immoral and violent at home and be fair judicious beneficent and idealistic abroad he hardly missed a beat after his transfer to baltimore founding an antiwar group peace mission whose operations included picketing the homes of defense secretary robert s mcnamara and secretary of state dean rusk in december 1966 by the fall of 1967 mr berrigan and three friends were ready to try a new tactic on oct 17 they walked into the baltimore customs house distracted the draft board clerks and methodically spattered selective service records with a red liquid made partly from their own blood three decades later mr berrigan remembered feeling exalted as the judge sentenced him to six years in prison from then on he would be in and out of jail for repeated efforts to interfere with government operations and deface military hardware even before his sentencing for the customs house raid father berrigan instigated a second invasion against the local draft board office in catonsville md among those persuaded to join was his older brother the rev daniel j berrigan a jesuit priest and poet who had been one of the first prominent clergymen to preach and organize against the war the catonsville nine struck on may 17 1968 taking hundreds of files relating to potential draftees from the second floor of the knights of columbus building where the draft board rented space they piled the documents in the parking lot and set them burning with a mixture of gasoline and soap chips homemade napalm reporters were on hand having been told in advance and they were given a statement that read we destroy these draft records not only because they exploit our young men but also because they represent misplaced power concentrated in the ruling class of america when the police arrived the trespassers were praying in the parking lot the cameras loved the berrigans in the definitive photograph of the event seven of the catonsville nine are nowhere to be seen the photo includes only the striking image of two priests in clerical dress one big and craggy the other slight and puckish serenely accepting their imminent incarceration with so many marches and campus protests going on across the country it would have been impossible to quantify the effect of a single event on public opinion what can be said about the catonsville raid is that it inspired others in new york city milwaukee boston chicago and other cities the tactic becoming a sort of calling card of the ultra resistance it also elevated the berrigan brothers to the status of superstars father phil and father dan were on the cover of time magazine and illuminated in profiles by the smartest writers but many americans saw them as communists and traitors or at best naive dupes of the vietcong philip francis berrigan was born oct 5 1923 in two harbors minn the youngest of six sons of thomas w berrigan and frida fromhart berrigan a german immigrant thomas berrigan was a frustrated poet and a bullying tyrannical husband and father he was also a political radical whose labor organizing activities led to his dismissal as a railroad engineer after which he moved to syracuse to be with his family and bought a farm after high school philip was a first baseman in semiprofessional baseball before enrolling in st michael 's college in toronto in january 1943 after one semester he was drafted into the army the life of black sharecroppers in georgia where he had basic training and the treatment of black soldiers on his troop ship to europe made an indelible impression on his conscience in retrospect once the war was over so did his own role in infantry and artillery battles that earned him a battlefield commission as second lieutenant in so many words he came to consider himself as guilty of murder as the germans and japanese along with this came the conviction that he had grown up on a diet of nationalistic propaganda in which the good white europeans always triumphed over evil anyone else as an assistant pastor in washington in 1955 and 1956 and a counselor and teacher at st augustine high school in new orleans from 1956 to 1963 the young priest became passionately involved in civil rights and antiwar activities especially after the cuban missile crisis in 1962

 both of his goals were nice each in its own way but neither was the best play of jaromir jagr 's performance his singular moment came on his assist what an assist against the philadelphia flyers tuesday night in game 3 of the pittsburgh penguins second round series of the stanley cup playoffs skating with the puck on his stick jagr turned away from the flyers net and took off in the opposite direction by the time he neared the blue line jagr had drawn three of the five flyers skaters into a merry chase of course i know that jagr said when asked about the people behind him i was waiting for our defenseman to jump in the hole you know where guys are when the penguins defenseman bob boughner moved into the vacated space jagr turned and flipped a pass over a stick to him boughner redirected the puck diagonally across the zone to martin straka who cut to the suddenly vulnerable net and knocked it past the goalie brian boucher it was no surprise that jagr had created all three pittsburgh goals he is the league 's reigning scoring champion and most valuable player going into games tonight jagr led the tournament in goals with 8 and in points with 16 although his performance tuesday was brilliant it was not enough to avoid a 4 3 defeat in overtime which left the penguins leading the four of seven game series by 2 games to 1 game 4 is here on thursday night and jagr is confident he said his team can play better and so can he oh of course jagr said we lost one game in overtime all of a sudden we 're going to say 'they 're better we 're good enough to beat anybody jagr said he had not fully recovered from the leg and back injuries that limited him to 63 appearances in the 82 game regular season today i feel a little bit better he said it 's going to be better and better hopefully my confidence is not here yet my skating is not there he said his current play is 60 percent or 70 percent of his capability hopefully it 's going to come jagr said referring to his peak level i need it the team needs it the national hockey league needs it too with wayne gretzky retired and eric lindros injured again the sport needs a star hook on which to hang its hype helmet a charismatic attacker to improve the entertainment level from the defensive deadened depths of recent seasons jagr who apprenticed under mario lemieux in the 1990 's might be that man in his 10th season jagr 28 is the team 's captain and the symbol of its composition he is from the czech republic and so are five of his teammates six more penguins are from other european nations the coach in waiting is ivan hlinka the associate head coach who is expected to replace herb brooks in the top job next season hlinka coached the czech republic to the olympic gold medal in 1998 during practice today while hlinka spoke and gestured with his hands jagr rested on one knee in front of him head raised eyes fixed the penguins are owned now by lemieux who rescued them and the money owed to him from bankruptcy court the general manager is craig patrick both men are among the progressives in their business they are matched in this round against the flyers whose chairman ed snider and general manager bob clarke are among the league 's traditionalists in terms of roster makeup for the game on tuesday all but one of the flyer players were from north america in game 2 frustrated by pittsburgh 's surprising two victories in philadelphia the flyers started a 10 man brawl darius kasparaitis the pittsburgh defenseman from lithuania was attacked by keith jones this is the year 2000 kasparaitis said not the year 1960 i do n't know what they 're trying to prove but they do n't scare us in terms of playing style the penguins are what is called an east west team that attacks by skating and passing from side to side while waiting for the perfect shooting moment the flyers are a north south team that rushes down lanes and fires lots of shots in game 3 the flyers outshot the penguins by 44 18 they have many good players suited to this style among them is john leclair the big left wing who scored once and knocked two pittsburgh defensemen out of the game at least temporarily after heavy unpenalized collisions no doubt the flyers would love to do the same to jagr but he is both strong and slippery difficult to hit commit too soon and he will embarrass you the way he did several times tuesday against philadelphia defenseman eric desjardins the flyers captain and one of the best at his craft what are they going to do jagr asked rhetorically i 've played the game long enough to control it the way i want to like lemieux before him jagr complains frequently about the holding hooking tripping and interference that often goes without penalty and allows mediocre players to bring good players down to their level for relaxation jagr said he has an interesting choice of sports on television i do n't watch hockey i watch basketball playoffs jagr said look at allen iverson if you are good enough and fast enough no way they are going to stop you in hockey they play physical with body checks and they put the stick on you in basketball they ca n't even put a hand on you that 's what i like about that game in hockey it 's not that easy certainly he was exaggerating for effect but his analogies and observations suggest a larger issue in the immediate sense the penguins and flyers are playing only for the right to meet the devils or toronto in the eastern conference finals in the larger sense it sometimes seems as if these two teams are struggling for the soul of their sport

 if only we could be a little more like the six stars of friends the nbc hit comedy it 's not their fame that is so appealing but rather their all for one one for all approach to negotiating when renewing their contracts early this year their strategy was that if they did n't make a certain amount per episode the same for each star they 'd all walk ultimately that amount would be 750000 most of us do n't have a posse of pals who can put their careers on hold for us nor do most people believe that they are worth that much simply to show up rehearse lines block movements and roll tape since most of us do n't have agents and lawyers negotiating our every move it is up to us to conduct our own business deals and most of us myself included fail miserably for starters there is the ego issue creative types and those just starting out often feel privileged to get paid to express themselves and they forget that they 're providing a service said david wallis a freelance writer and chief executive of featurewellcom a manhattan based syndicate for established journalists i know just what he means the first time i published an article at the age of 21 i was so thrilled that someone was willing to pay me to write i would have paid them the 25 it did n't occur to me that i could have asked for 30 after all why be contentious when a million other eager young writers are out there all waiting to take your place when you 're younger you do n't realize that you 're supposed to play the business game and you have no experience at it anyway said david seigerman 34 a producer at cnn sports illustrated i always folded too quickly and i probably lost a lot of money because of it he said of some earlier jobs as a writer then there are the transactions themselves do you wait for the potential employer to mention money or do you bring it up yourself should you ask if there is room to go higher or should you say something like oh 500 is fine but my dog needs a liver transplant and my roof is caving in so do you think you could up it a few grand and let me start my workday at noon never ask to negotiate said brian d krueger author of college grad job hunter adams media and a webmaster and content provider at collegegradcom a career web site for recent college graduates you should go into every situation assuming that everything is open to negotiation he said without that assumption you would give up a negotiating chip without getting anything in return a fatal error in negotiating and may never even get to the table since they could slam the door in your face to bring up external and or personal circumstances is also not a valid approach since there 's no ownership of these issues on the other side the best approach he said is to be straightforward and never give away anything without gaining something in return easy for him to say i 've orchestrated deals that i naively thought were clear to both parties only to find that our definitions of say flexible hours and nontraditional workplace were radically different the solution mr wallis said is to get it in writing assume that you could always be misunderstood he said so do n't be afraid to ask for a three line clarification even a 'what if scenario to that end be sure to get a second opinion from a trusted professional a friend who has been in the same situation or an industry expert before signing on the dotted line that advice applies even if that line was put there by your agent or lawyer the process is less awkward than it used to be because more people of all ages are conducting their job negotiations through e mail which leaves a record of the discussions you can carefully choose your wording to present the information in the most effective manner perhaps even including additional back up information which might not normally be included in an oral exchange mr krueger said in this way the negotiating becomes much more controlled and systematic of course you may still have to accept that a final offer means just that if the job is beneficial to your career your first writing gig for example be practical mr wallis advised at the same time you must be prepared to walk away from what you really want he said clients respect you more if you stand up for yourself be a little cocky do n't be too overeager let them think you do n't need them as much as you do and what if they say they can not match your price and let you wander into the sunset find five buddies to stand up on your behalf it might not get you 750000 an assignment but at least you 'll know who your friends are preludes abby ellin is a manhattan writer her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third sunday of each month e mail preludes nytimescom
 neuroscientists have found an evocative solution to a classic problem which is more important in shaping the human brain nature or nurture their answer is complex the brain is not primarily the product of genes they say but neither is it simply the sum of one 's experiences rather they say each human brain is constructed of complex neural circuits that start taking shape before birth and continue to grow and change throughout life as genes and cells are influenced by environment experience and culture there is widespread agreement that genes and environment interact in brain development said dr terrence j sejnowski a neuroscientist at the salk institute in san diego and a leading proponent of the new synthesis the new idea he said is that human cultures which teach children what to believe and what to expect in life interact with cell biology and molecular genetics to assemble the highly social human brain though everyone 's brain begins with a basic scaffold of connectivity that is formed according to genetic blueprints said dr carla shatz a developmental neurobiologist at harvard medical school a baby 's brain is not a miniature of the adult 's but rather is a dynamically changing structure experience alters brain structure chemistry and gene expression to sculpture immature neural circuits into adult circuitry she said in short the theory 's advocates say while the brain directs people 's activities in everyday life the activities themselves shape the brain throughout life the attempt to separate genes and environment is a mistake said dr steven r quartz a scientist at the california institute of technology what makes us who we are is a complex interplay of early experiences parenting birth order friends genes and how these forces interact he and dr sejnowski wrote liars lovers and heroes published last month which outlines details of what they call cultural biology another book making similar arguments the origin of minds is to be published this month its authors are dr peggy la cerra a neuroscientist and president of a consulting firm in ojai calif and roger bingham of the center for brain and cognition at the university of california at san diego scientists and philosophers have argued about the role of culture in shaping the brain for millenniums plato and artistotle argued over whether human traits like virtue were inborn or learned darwin 's ideas led many scholars to declare that human traits were inborn with each racial group at a different level of evolution a view that culminated in the unbridled eugenics of the holocaust the backlash was an era of cultural relativism which saw the newborn brain as a blank slate that evolution had no part in a new battle over human nature began in the 1970 's when dr edward o wilson argued that human behavior like that of other animals was a product of the evolutionary pressures of natural selection evolutionary psychologists adopted this argument using it to explain everything from sexual differences in dating behavior to the appeal of potato chips the advocates of the new neurobiological view say it is time to look more closely at the evidence for evolutionary psychology 's position it 's true you ca n't separate the question of who we are from the world our ancestors passed through on their way to becoming us dr sejnowski said but that evolution did not occur in the relatively stable savanna described by evolutionary psychologists he said but rather during a period of unusual extreme and rapid oscillations in climate if the brain evolved any trait during the pleistocene he declared it was flexibility while it is true that different brain regions tend to specialize in different functions like language or face recognition dr sejnowski said these areas are very changeable and not hard wired modules humans are born with temperaments arising from genetic variations in brain chemicals called neuromodulators dr quartz said these differences may lead one baby to avoid novelty and another to seek it but the experiences that result help construct the growing brain humans are also born with a very large prefrontal cortex a higher brain region involved in planning that taps into an ancient system for predicting what is rewarding and making decisions to maximize rewards and avoid punishments neuroscientists are finding that this circuit which fully matures in late adolescence is an internal guidance system that fills each person 's world with values meaning and emotional tone taking shape according to a person 's culture in other words culture contributes not just to the brain 's contents but to its wiring as well dr quartz said

 the nation 's population increased by more people in the 1990 's than any other 10 year period in united states history surpassing the growth between 1950 and 1960 at the peak of the baby boom the census bureau reported today even as many other industrial countries are suffering declining populations because of shrinking birth rates the united states swelled by 327 million people in the last decade to 2814 million the result of waves of young immigrants with families and a steady birth rate that outpaced deaths the increase which was greater than the country 's population total during the civil war easily surpassed the previous record growth of 28 million in the 1950 's the growth in the 1990 's was notable for not only its size but also its breadth for the first time in the 20th century the population of all 50 states increased ranging from a half percent rise in north dakota to 66 percent in nevada eighty percent of the nation 's 3141 counties and equivalent areas grew compared with 55 percent in the 1980 's among the intriguing trends emerging from the 2000 head count was the convergence of two major demographic patterns sprawl from metropolitan areas accelerated through the 1990 's to where it spilled into once rural areas stemming decades long population declines in many nonmetropolitan counties the two fastest growing nonmetropolitan counties in the 1990 's were both in colorado elbert county a farming area in the plains near denver and park county a cattle grazing region nestled in the rockies both counties more than doubled in size between 1990 and 2000 a lot of growth in nonmetropolitan areas in the last decade has come in counties that adjoin metropolitan areas and is changing the character of those counties said calvin l beale a senior demographer at the agriculture department who has analyzed population shifts in nonmetropolitan counties the nation grew faster and in more corners of the country than the census bureau projected the number of people in metropolitan areas grew by 14 percent in the last decade narrowly exceeding nonmetropolitan counties which grew by 10 percent four of five americans still live in cities or suburbs eight of the 10 largest cities gained population in the 1990 's with only philadelphia and detroit shrinking new york los angeles and chicago remained the top three metropolises but in a sign of the sunbelt 's pull on americans and immigrants houston phoenix and san diego were three of the next four largest cities despite its population loss philadelphia still ranks fifth behind houston and ahead of phoenix as a result the population center of the country as calculated by the census bureau moved to edgar springs mo nearly 40 miles southwest of desoto mo the population midpoint 10 years ago the population center is determined as the place where an imaginary flat weightless map of the country would balance perfectly if all 2814 million americans were of identical weight the west grew by 197 percent and the south by 173 percent compared with only 79 percent in the midwest and 55 percent in the northeast these patterns revived states like wyoming and colorado that lost people in the 1980 's with the downturn in the mining and energy industries large swaths of the rural heartland continued to hollow out from the dakotas to western texas but the number of counties that dropped by 10 percent or more in some cases was far fewer than in the 1980 's moreover several other midwestern states experienced their fastest growth in decades missouri 's 9 percent increase was the state 's largest decade to decade lift since the period from 1890 to 1900 the ozarks have attracted retirees and families moving out of cities who seek a better quality of life mr beale said the nation 's middle sized cities ranging from 250000 to slightly fewer than 2 million people outpaced growth for the smallest and very largest cities again much of this growth centered in the west with californians in particular heading not just to phoenix and denver but also coeur d'alene idaho and western colorado said marc j perry a census bureau demographer john long chief of the census bureau 's population division said today that early data showed younger non hispanic whites moving to urban areas many seeking jobs and homes in the cities one prominent expert hugh b price president of the urban league said that the reduction in city crime coupled with quality housing and cultural diversity had drawn many young white professionals back to urban settings that reminded them of their college years
 continued high prices for natural gas will drive some industries offshore and increase gas imports by tanker according to participants at a meeting the energy department convened here today to confront gas shortages energy secretary spencer abraham said prices were so high that some companies using natural gas in manufacturing would find it more profitable to shut down and then sell their gas reserves he and others predicted higher costs for summer electricity and winter heating the country is running out of gas and balancing the demand by destroying jobs said william s stavropoulos chairman and chief executive of dow chemical which burns natural gas for heat and uses it as an ingredient in chemical products on the other hand john f nunley iii director of the energy office of the state of wyoming an oil and gas producer said it was hard to say now what the supply and demand picture would be next winter we must keep in mind that things may work out just fine without action by government said mr nunley who is chairman of the national association of state energy officials experts trace the current high prices and low inventories to a small dip in production and increased demand over an unusually cold winter higher gas prices are lifting electricity prices and thus revenue for companies that make electricity from coal or nuclear power they are also stimulating interest in imports patrick henry wood iii chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission said that the nation 's import capacity is about three billion cubic feet a day but that companies had filed for permits to increase that to nine billion cubic feet a day by 2007 fifteen projects under study around the country could increase import capacity to more than 13 billion cubic feet a day by 2009 he said the united states is on its way to becoming part of a global gas market said daniel yergin an energy expert and adviser to the energy secretary he painted a picture for natural gas in this decade much like that of oil in the 1970 's when prices rose and stimulated drilling but domestic supplies were still inadequate and imports had to make up the difference natural gas imports could make up 5 percent of american energy demand by 2020 up from well under 1 percent now mr yergin said and would come from a broader range of countries than those that supply oil also he noted there is no export cartel for natural gas as there is for oil the technology used to turn natural gas into a liquid has improved and experts say that the price per million british thermal units needed to justify new investment is in the range of 3 to 450 lately the price has hovered around 6 although few expect it to stay that high a million btu 's is the energy equivalent of about 72 gallons of diesel fuel the most modern gas fired electric plants can make about 140 kilowatt hours from that amount of gas which is enough electricity to power a single family house for three or four days depending on the climate but older plants can produce only about half as much electricity from that amount of gas if power companies expect high prices to become permanent they are likely to modernize such plants which would stretch gas supplies experts say several participants in the meeting said prices were likely to stay high by historical standards because the current price squeeze was different from the last crisis that was in the mid 1970 's when price controls discouraged exploration when they were lifted new drilling swelled inventories this time high prices have spurred drilling there are 915 drilling rigs at work up about 50 percent over last year but increases in supplies when they come are expected to be modest because the gas fields on shore in the lower 48 states in canada and in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico are past their prime experts say some experts said domestic production could be pushed up sharply if the industry were allowed into the eastern gulf of mexico and the atlantic and pacific coasts where drilling has been barred by successive republican and democratic administrations and on public lands some power producers have raised the idea that because natural gas prices are high the federal government should temporarily relax air pollution rules allowing more coal and oil to be burned coal is burned in specialized plants but some turbines designed for natural gas can burn oil as well but e linn draper jr chairman and chief executive of american electric power the nation 's biggest coal customer said today that that idea was premature robert card an under secretary of energy said in an interview that his department would not propose measures that would make air pollution worse but might endorse them if states raised the issue as california did during its electricity crisis daniel a lashof of the natural resources defense council told the group that the country should ride out this boom part of the boom and bust gas business high gas prices inflict harm on people and our economy but so does pollution he said outside the meeting at the mayflower hotel about two dozen protesters from the us public interest research group carried signs with slogans like windmills not oil wells the energy department announced today that last week for the fourth consecutive week the amount of gas put into storage for winter set a record the total though is still about 19 percent below the five year average for this time of year

 during the bleakest of football seasons in new york the echoes of two teams gone awry bounce off each other jets coach herman edwards observes giants coach jim fassel 's excruciating season and empathizes it is a small fraternity of coaches who work in the national football league and an even more rarefied group that walks the tightrope in new york so with both teams at 4 7 perhaps only edwards can truly feel fassel 's pain even if edwards 's job is not in jeopardy jim handles it the best way he knows how edwards said you hate to see good coaches go through this but we all do they 're going to do it to me they did it to tom landry when times get bad they forget all the good things you have ever done he 's a good football coach and he will coach again whether it 's with the giants or whoever it may be he took that team to the super bowl he has been in the playoffs and they still have an opportunity to go to the playoffs although edwards is safe after making the playoffs his first two years as the jets coach this season has taken a toll on him his hair has more gray and he has looked haggard particularly during the team 's 0 4 start edwards was angered when after the team began 0 3 the jets owner woody johnson said that he thought the team had as much talent or more than any other team in the league on friday when asked to reflect on the loss of four free agent players to the washington redskins in the off season edwards again lamented the jets inability to keep their players noting that the team lost chemistry as well as personnel edwards is in danger of not going to the playoffs for only the third time since he became a coach in 1992 if the jets win their last five games a tall order considering they play tennessee 9 2 on monday night and still have new england and miami on the schedule they will finish 9 7 the same record they had last season that would seem a remarkable accomplishment considering the jets lost chad pennington for six games and started the season 2 6 but it will not be enough for edwards to consider this a successful season the only season that can be considered a success he says is one that ends with a super bowl victory you do n't just play these games to say we had a winning year he said if you do n't win it all that 's what i look at i 've only played in one i have never won one to me that 's a successful season you are not playing for anything else edwards has never heard fans chanting for his firing as fassel has but he sometimes describes the call to coaching as something that sounds like an affliction earlier this season when edwards was asked about 62 year old bill parcells 's return to coaching edwards 49 said he could not imagine himself coaching at 60 we are a weird lot edwards said something is wrong with all of us when you win a game you 're satisfied from the time you walk off the field into the tunnel you see your players eyes you see the elation everyone has they are all excited because you just accomplished something you feel great you talk to the press nicely because you won and you leave the locker room and when you sit on that bus then you start thinking about next week that 's how long it is and i always ask myself 'why do you do this what is wrong with you son you are smarter than this your gut always hurts on that bus ride from that stadium back here my mind is already on 'what 's my speech monday edwards said it was very hard when you 're not going through a winning year he added you think 'that cloud is not coming over my door but it does and then you find out how you handle it i am learning how to handle it if we do n't go to the playoffs we are going to get something good out of it you ca n't think you go unscathed and think it 's not going to happen to you because it happens to everybody he only has to look to fassel for proof extra points defensive end john abraham who is doubtful for monday 's game with an aggravation of the groin strain that caused him to miss three games said he was not sure if he would be able to play again this season i would like to play abraham said i 'm not going to try to rush back before i was worried about getting back on the field now i 'm worried about getting healthy titans quarterback steve mcnair who has an injured right calf will be evaluated a few hours before kickoff monday to determine whether he will be able to play if he ca n't bill volek will make his first career start

 when the ncaa division i men 's lacrosse final was not quite 27 minutes old today second seeded virginia had a 5 0 lead on first seeded johns hopkins but no one from virginia was celebrating yet those things scare you a little bit dom starsia the virginia coach said later because you get a false sense of security his players knew there were problems ahead we were just getting good shots said chris rotelli virginia 's all american midfielder tillman johnson the cavaliers all american goalie said we knew they would have a run johns hopkins made its run but it never got closer than 6 5 virginia made the early lead stand up and won 9 7 giving the cavaliers their second national title in five years under starsia and third over all patiently and carefully virginia nursed its early lead taking its shots from close up meanwhile johnson who played sensationally in saturday 's semifinal rout of maryland was merely spectacular this time with 13 saves johnson a junior from annapolis md was at his best in the fourth quarter after his midfield teammate billy glading drew a 30 second penalty for pushing this is how johnson protected virginia 's 8 5 lead with 13 minutes remaining kyle barrie of johns hopkins raced in and fired a shot point blank johnson saved it but he made a bad clearing pass with 12 minutes 49 seconds remaining bobby benson fired a shot point blank johnson saved it with 12 43 remaining kevin boland fired a shot point blank johnson saved it seventeen seconds three point blank shots three saves those last two were on the doorstep johnson said but this is the time when you have to step up if you 're the hot goalie you 're an asset to your team i had fun i was n't stressed out i did n't tell myself i have to win this thing adam doneger the all american midfielder for johns hopkins took nine shots four on goal and scored twice he had kind words for johnson saying he got the better of me today had there been a betting line johns hopkins 14 2 might have been a three goal favorite over virginia 15 2 but many observers believed that virginia could win if johnson played his best johnson took the bit do i enjoy being the focus he said of course it 's the dream of my life winning the national championship and being voted the player of the game like everyone else connected with the game johnson was excited by the large crowd at mt bank stadium formerly ravens stadium the crowd of 37944 was the largest for an ncaa final breaking the record of 26229 for the 1995 final at the university of maryland 's byrd stadium there was one huge problem the muddy field four days of rain had ended before the game but two games saturday two sunday and one today damaged the grass field players often slipped and tripped without contact once matt ward of virginia diving for a loose ball skidded 7 yards on his back it was probably the worst field i 've ever been on starsia said in a sport in which stopping on a dime and spinning away are routine the mud made a difference starsia dealt with it by having his defenders stick to a man to man defense and not switch off ball control was a factor too virginia held possession for the last shot of the first quarter scoring with two seconds left and did the same with five seconds left in the third quarter aj shannon scored four goals for the cavaliers in 1987 when johns hopkins won its seventh national title dave pietramala was its star defenseman now he is the john hopkins coach and he had praise for virginia if you told me we were going to hold them to nine goals he said i would have told you we were going to win their players played terrific they did a great job attacking the goal we made too many mistakes they deserved to win today and what did starsia the winning coach feel relief he said with a tired smile

 the mets responded yesterday to the counteroffer made by tom glavine 's agent with one of their own but they were behind before they even picked up the phone after glavine 's agent gregg clifton delivered his first proposal to the mets the phillies and the braves on tuesday requesting a four year deal for 45 million the phillies responded that night by calling clifton to increase their offer in both value and length the phillies proposal initially for three years and 27 million is now at three years and 30 million plus a 10 million option based on innings pitched a person familiar with the negotiations said that makes the phillies the front runners for glavine a 36 year old free agent left hander as far as guaranteed money is concerned and continues their willingness to set the market for free agents the mets revised offer delivered yesterday by their assistant general manager jim duquette was for three years and 285 million the same as their original proposal plus an option for 95 million in the fourth year also based on innings pitched the braves have not budged from their last offer a two year contract for about the same annual value as the mets and the phillies initial offers plus an option for a third year as of yesterday afternoon clifton had not heard from braves general manager john schuerholz since monday tom is excited because both teams have four year proposals clifton said of the phillies and the mets terming the options involving a fourth year a major step forward the mets were wondering what the phillies would do next having signed the free agent third baseman david bell to join a cadre of young players and with a new stadium opening in 2004 the phillies do not appear to have a limit to their budget essentially spending the money they would have committed to third baseman scott rolen before he was traded to st louis in july the phillies have offered a six year deal to the free agent first baseman jim thome in the range of 80 million to 85 million thome was deciding between that and the indians offer which was said to be for five years and 60 million thome has played his entire career with the indians and he may wait until next week to make a decision the mets afraid the phillies are driving up the market even though prices for free agents seem to be declining are unsure how long they can stay in the glavine hunt the mets owner fred wilpon who declined to comment on glavine yesterday has made signing him his priority this off season but clifton has made it clear he wants a fourth year for glavine who will be 40 at the start of that season if the phillies were to change the option into a guaranteed fourth season it is doubtful the mets would follow one person familiar with the mets plans said last night the mets and the phillies had both feared that glavine 's desire was to remain in atlanta and that he was negotiating to bring the braves offer in line with those of the mets and the phillies clifton has stressed that glavine will not take less money to remain with the braves the only team he has pitched for in his 16 year career meaning the braves are not even the mets greatest worry at least for now he 's told me from the beginning there 's no discount to the atlanta braves clifton said can i swear if there was a gun to my head what he would do if it comes right down to it who knows in a statement acknowledging a counteroffer from glavine the mets said we expect to hear back from them sometime after the holidays mets general manager steve phillips is due back from a cruise tonight and clifton said he would probably contact the mets and the phillies tomorrow clifton said neither team termed its proposal a final offer and he said that glavine could make his decision next week the mets option would kick in if glavine reached a certain number of innings in the third year of the contract or a combined number over the three years philadelphia 's option could be reached in either the final year or over the final two years inside pitch while waiting to learn if they will sign tom glavine and to see what offers the free agent third baseman edgardo alfonzo receives from other teams steve phillips met recently at shea stadium with the agent for the free agent third baseman norihiro nakamura of the kintetsu buffaloes of japan nakamura turned down an offer yesterday from the yomiuri giants after the team shifted its attention to signing first baseman roberto petagine to replace the free agent hideki matsui the kyodo news service reported nakamura has expressed interest in playing in america but kintetsu and the hanshin tigers are both interested in him and he is likely to command more money in japan than in the major leagues
 dennis o'sullivan was an impressionable rookie last year the first thing he heard in the jets training camp was make sure the holder does n't have to twirl the laces for o'sullivan the idea of snapping a football while an opponent was trying to knock his helmet off was hard enough but to hike the ball with the laces facing up so that it could be spotted perfectly for the place kicker i said 'what are you nuts o'sullivan recalled today obviously not that 's what it takes to be a long snapper in the national football league during the off season o'sullivan displaced the team incumbent john hudson who the jets said never made a bad snap in four seasons about 600 attempts for punts extra points and field goals but o'sullivan comes cheaper he will earn 193000 the minimum for a first year player he was on the practice squad last year hudson would have earned the veteran minimum of 440000 that does not sound like much when millions are spent fielding a team but that much money is almost as much as your entire practice squad will earn said bill parcells the jets director of football operations the entire five man squad will cost about 300000 you take 250000 from here 250000 from there wherever you can get it because of the salary cap strictures hudson is back home on the farm in paris tenn snapping the ball every day and waiting for a phone call in case o'sullivan is injured or the youngster performs horribly saturday night in the third preseason game at baltimore o'sullivan expects to do the job though which will earn him more than 1000 a snap about 12000 a game i was just thinking today 'is there anything in sports similar to what i do o'sullivan said people ask me what i do and i tell them i 'm a football player but that i 'm also a long snapper and sometimes they do n't know what that means so i tell them i 'm the guy who throws the ball between his legs to the punter there is more to him than that though a graduate of tulane he was an intern for one summer for gov george pataki his mother ann a former councilwoman from stony point ny is a special assistant to the governor and recently took on the added duties of working closely with libby pataki the state 's first lady o'sullivan 's father jim is a retired new york city police officer i think working in the governor 's office has given me a sense that i like helping people said o'sullivan a graduate of north rockland high school in rockland county ny i 've been around politics a long time i worked on the governor 's campaign and i 've been intrigued with it at tulane he was a defensive lineman and a snapper the jets converted him to the offensive line he is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 285 pounds and he may actually see duties other than snapping the special teams coach mike sweatman said today that he is using o'sullivan on the wedge on kick returns hudson never played when he was not snapping indeed while all around him was chaos hudson calmly spread his legs on the sidelines and made make believe snaps it is unlikely o'sullivan will see any action as an offensive lineman though the jets have a very able first string unit and they have some depth there as well still in today 's two a day workouts in high heat and humidity o'sullivan worked with the offensive linemen as well as handled the snaps center kevin mawae is listed as the backup snapper but mawae has told the coaches that he does not want to snap the ball o'sullivan does most of the work explode sully do n't extend so much the line coach bill muir cautioned during the drills muir watches o'sullivan more closely than most in trying to create an nfl lineman i think he does a good job coach al groh said he 's a football player that 's the first thing to know about him o'sullivan has had one bad snap this summer a high ball to punter tom tupa in the opening preseason game against the saints tupa 's punt was returned for a touchdown o'sullivan claimed he has forgotten about the snap perhaps he has he 's not content to be just a snapper groh said football is still a game of toughness extra points left cornerback aaron glenn sprained his left ankle in the morning workout the jets did not indicate whether it would keep him out of saturday 's game if it does the rookie tony scott a sixth round pick might fill in he has moved up to starting nickel back the jets will travel to baltimore by train leaving friday the first time since at least 1963 the team will have taken a train according to a club spokesman linebacker courtney ledyard broke up a pass intended for mike stack actually it bounced off ledyard 's helmet way to use your head courtney coach al groh shouted meanwhile the top draft pick shaun ellis continues to get scolded at every opportunity by the defensive line coach ray hamilton

 the rangers would have felt good about themselves had they simply tied the philadelphia flyers at madison square garden last night instead the rangers wound up feeling ecstatic with new york trailing by a goal little theo fleury sent the game into overtime at 17 minutes 8 seconds of the third period fleury then won it 2 46 into the extra session while being tackled by mark recchi fleury scored while bowling over philadelphia goalie roman cechmanek fleury 's second goal of the evening and 26th of the season gave the rangers a 4 3 triumph over the flyers marking the first time in the 16 games this season that the rangers have rallied to win after trailing going into the final period fleury 's heroics saved mike richter who was fairly solid for most of the evening but who allowed a particularly soft goal to eric desjardins that gave the flyers a 3 2 lead with less than six minutes left in regulation the victory was the 266th of richter 's career tying him with ed giacomin for the most in franchise history he has now won consecutive games for the first time since dec 6 and 8 maybe this will snap him out of it coach ron low said of the struggling richter who made 31 saves we have to bail him out once in a while he 's going to bail us out too fleury who will represent the rangers at next month 's all star game with brian leetch did much of the bailing out last night that was probably my best game as a ranger said fleury who had 4 points on the evening finally a big goal that was the thing that had bothered me most when i 've scored they have n't been real real big goals that has been the one thing that has been lacking in my game the timing of my goals i 've got 26 and only 2 are game winners that 's what you want to do go out and score the big goals the rangers had plenty of reasons to feel good about their performance they scored a power play goal for one thing they were also able to shake off a power play goal they scored on themselves they fought back from a two goal second period deficit then from desjardins 's seemingly crushing goal right now any point is a good point for us said mark messier who turns 40 tomorrow and who celebrated last night with a pair of assists messier was speaking about the standing not snapping a nine game pointless drought that was the longest of his 22 year national hockey league career richter found himself trailing by 2 0 just 5 01 into the second period when the flyers scored on consecutive shots the first was actually taken by leetch who pushed a rebound back toward richter hoping that his goalie would smother it instead the puck slid beneath richter hit rick tocchet 's skate and went in at 4 44 just 17 seconds later paul ranheim fired a one timer past richter a shot from above the right wing circle that may have deflected off messier it remained 2 0 until late in the period when the rangers finally received a break of their own it came when a messier centering pass was blocked the puck caromed out to tomas kloucek above the left wing circle and he threw it on net with a seemingly harmless shot and was rewarded with his first nhl goal at 18 09 of the second period the rangers tied the score at 2 2 midway through the third period from an unlikely source their moribund power play which had not scored at the garden in nearly a month the rangers had not scored anywhere on their power play in their last 30 chances but with just seconds left before it was about to turn 31 fleury made a nice play to keep the puck in the zone at the blue line he passed to leetch who skated down the left wing boards before reversing the puck back to fleury with a no look pass fleury 's shot from the left circle struck cechmanek on his right shoulder the rebound plopped down in the low slot giving radek dvorak just enough time to bat it in off cechmanek 's skate at 9 51 but desjardins somehow beat richter from the right wing boards above the right circle richter had seen the shot all the way but he tried like a matador to flick the shot away with his stick richter missed the puck went through his legs all the life was sucked out of the garden and at 13 04 the flyers had retaken the lead but then fleury saved the day

 for the first two innings yesterday at shea stadium arizona 's randy johnson and chad moeller essentially played an uninterrupted game of catch with johnson 's fastball reaching 96 miles an hour and his sliders and splitters hitting 90 the mets flailed away fruitlessly they eventually began to make inconsequential contact which did not stop them from serving as pawns in the latest masterpiece by johnson an imposing left hander going a full nine innings for the fourth time this season johnson struck out 11 batters including the first six he faced and matched his season low by allowing only two base hits his brilliance produced a 2 0 arizona diamondbacks victory and the first four game series sweep of the mets at shea since philadelphia stopped them in june 1995 he 's a power pitcher who knows how to pitch said mo vaughn the only met to make solid contact all afternoon he uses both sides of the plate and he can reach back when he needs to if he does n't make a mistake in an at bat he 's going to get you out the loss went a long way toward squashing the mets postseason hopes losers of their last five games the mets caught a break when philadelphia beat los angeles yesterday 7 5 that kept the mets six and a half game deficit in the national league wild card race from growing now set to begin a six game trip tonight in milwaukee the mets 55 56 are trying to remain optimistic despite falling below 500 for the first time since july 14 it was a tough four game turnaround no doubt about that mets manager bobby valentine said but things can turn around in a favorable way just like that and we can be right where we want to be and making a move again before yesterday 's game the mets believed they could beat johnson they had done so twice in four games against him and his earned run average in two games at shea was 476 he was also coming off a start last wednesday in which he threw 149 pitches to beat montreal but johnson 16 4 made it clear immediately that he was neither weary nor vulnerable the mets put the ball in play in the third inning but no one reached base until johnson walked john valentin in the fifth inning roger cedeno recorded the mets first hit in the sixth on a chopping grounder to third base that he beat out with a headfirst dive into first the next inning vaughn who struck out three times hit a line drive to right concluding the mets offensive output he had a very very good slider today and he was throwing 95 valentine said of johnson but shawn estes was matching him pitch for pitch there and it was whoever scored first estes 4 9 was the one bright spot for the mets throwing well for the fourth straight start he allowed four hits in seven innings he ran into trouble in the sixth when quinton mccracken lined a triple into the gap in left center field craig counsell drove mccracken home for the game 's first run with a hard shot down the first base line that barely eluded vaughn 's grasp matt williams opened the seventh inning by launching an 81 mph changeup over the wall in left center it was williams 's fourth home run in 22 at bats against estes nonetheless estes 's continued improvement was an encouraging sign for the mets in each of his last four starts estes has gone six or more innings and allowed no more than two runs he 's been throwing great mike piazza said he was a little dejected when he came out of the game but i told him that a questionable call over the first base bag and one mistake to matt williams i 'll take that every outing he only gave up two runs you figure that sooner or late we 're going to give him some run support piazza was referring to counsell 's double that scored mccracken but the ball was clearly fair despite johnson 's dominance the mets had a good opportunity to score in the fifth after valentin walked williams threw a grounder hit by joe mcewing into right field while attempting to nail valentin at second base valentin went to third but while attempting to bunt timo perez popped out to moeller johnson then intentionally walked rey ordonez to get to estes who went down swinging he 's tough to hit and tough to bunt too valentine said of perez 's effort i thought it was a heck of a play to try to get a bunt down there but he caught it off the end of the bat if he gets it down we probably score though it was one of his finest outings of the season johnson said he was never comfortable because of the humidity it was a mental and physical grind he said much more so for the mets inside pitch though he has lost his spot in the rotation because of the recent trade for john thomson jeff d'amico will start tomorrow in milwaukee because saturday 's doubleheader has forced the mets to go with a six man rotation roberto alomar strained left groin muscle and edgardo alfonzo strained left rib cage muscle did not play bobby valentine said alomar could be back in a couple of days if he makes as much improvement tomorrow as he did today i think he 'll be real close valentine said alfonzo is further away but he is not a candidate for the disabled list after going 4 for 5 in his first major league start on sunday ty wigginton went 0 for 4 mike piazza admitted that the mets were reaching their wits end i 'm not going to deny the fact that we 're frustrated he said we 've got some guys banged up but we just did n't get it done i do n't know what else to say the mets six and the diamondbacks nine combined to hit 15 home runs during the series tying the shea stadium record for a series of any length

 in so many ways coach larry robinson seems to have his motivational thumb on the psychic pulse of the devils when they trailed the philadelphia flyers by three games to one in the eastern conference finals he screamed at the players and spurred their historic comeback when the captain scott stevens felt depressed after injuring eric lindros with a big check in last night 's first period robinson took him aside in the dressing room during the first intermission and counseled him to change his frame of mind and when patrik elias scored twice to lead the devils to a 2 1 victory that clinched the series and put the devils in the stanley cup finals against either dallas or colorado robinson was grudging with his praise for the young winger it was good that elias scored robinson said but it would be better if he went to the net more often that way robinson said he would get even more goals with another series to worry about robinson does not want any player becoming complacent with his success last night 's victory came in a tense taut game that concluded a grinding grueling series along with big hits by stevens and big goals by elias the devils got a brilliant recovery from martin brodeur the goalie who slumped badly early in the series and then gradually returned to top form brodeur gave credit to the coach particularly for his angry speech after game 4 what he told us was coming from his heart brodeur said it touched a lot of players 's feelings he 's really nice to be around it 's easy to play hockey for him it was great for him to spit it out sometimes coaches have a hard time getting their messages through but he did brodeur said the devils entered the tournament with zero confidence because they slumped in the fourth quarter of the season robinson replaced the fired robbie ftorek with eight games remaining his team eliminated florida in four games toronto in six and philadelphia in seven now we have a chance to play for the stanley cup brodeur said it 's really rewarding when the devils first reached the stanley cup finals in their championship season of 1995 robinson was jacques lemaire 's top assistant the nice cop to lemaire 's tough cop after four unspectacular seasons as head coach of the los angeles kings robinson returned to new jersey this season to assist ftorek robinson was reluctant to take over but he did as he was told after robinson 's outburst stevens said robinson 's mood changed quickly back to the larry we know the larry we want to see more of stevens said because he is such a great guy and good to everyone everyone respects him you want to play for a guy like larry because he is a players coach we snapped to right back where we should be we had to or else we were going to die together scott gomez said players knew it was coming from the heart when larry screamed at us because he 's not a yeller when you see a guy like larry robinson spilling his heart out to you we did n't take it as 'what 's with this guy we 've tried our best because we did n't so we really appreciated it robinson said the pressure of game 7 in this round might have a positive effect particularly on a roster with four rookies gomez john madden colin white and brian rafalski and several young veterans like elias we 're growing as players and as persons also all together elias said he was speaking of his linemates petr sykora and jason arnott but his words applied to many others regarding robinson 's speech elias said i looked deep down in myself if i was doing my best what could i do better when asked what he discovered elias said we were working hard but maybe not working smart robinson speaking of game 7 pressure said as far as the young kids it 's something they are going to remember for the rest of their lives a lot of times it takes players from one level to another level just because of the intensity and the importance of the game referring to my tirade robinson said i knew we were a better team than we were showing when someone asked robinson what does this accomplishment mean to you personally the coach snapped back a reply it does n't mean a thing he said this is about those 24 guys that have to go on the ice every day and sweat and take pucks in the mouth and get their heads banged against the wall it 's about the team and the team is four victories away from another cup they showered dressed their wounds and boarded the bus for their final trip up the turnpike of this round before the final period stevens had told his teammates let 's make this the best bus ride home afterward stevens said we 're going to have a heck of a bus ride home

 julie harris is a theater star who has prevailed for more than 50 years if i were on a street corner and we had an audience she says there is no need for her to finish that sentence having emphasized the word audience she quickly adds what 's important to me is that there 's an audience that wants to hear a story such uncomplicated feelings explain why ms harris is a theater star perhaps the last great american theater star her contract with performing art has only one condition that there be an audience and in the old established now bygone tradition a theater star tours coming up nyack princeton and newark movies even opposite james dean in east of eden and television are mere detours that 's true even though it may not get much better than a prominent role in a prime time series that lasts seven years knots landing of the 1980 's not to mention scores of lavishly praised performances many emmy nominated with two awards including one last year for a voice over still ms harris said there 's nothing quite so marvelous as hearing words close and immediate and a theater star as tennessee williams said about a poet is in the business of illusion he made the point in the glass menagerie in which ms harris has played both laura the tremulous daughter to jessica tandy 's amanda and amanda the overwrought mother to calista flockhart 's laura last year when ms harris was asked to reprise her classic 1976 portrayal of emily dickinson the 19th century poet in the belle of amherst the fifth of her five tony awards she wondered whether she was too old emily was 53 she recalled thinking then i 'll be 75 those 20 years or so are nothing in an actor 's life she said this is not about age it 's about the wonder and beauty of her work after all julie harris was 24 when she played the lonely adolescent frankie addams her breakout role in the member of the wedding in 1950 an interviewer recalled that frankie was 12 ms harris is devoted to precision twelve and three quarters she said the actress has come back to belle with passion renewed last february at lincoln center she acted the role in my business is to love a musical resetting of dickinson 's words with renee fleming as her singing counterpart on tuesday ms harris is to give the first of eight performances of the belle of amherst william luce 's one woman play at the helen hayes performing arts center in nyack the first show is a benefit for the clear view school for emotionally disturbed young people in briarcliff manor the school has a theater named for ms harris who lived in irvington in the 1970 's when the school rented space in dobbs ferry since the school 's move to briarcliff manor in 1981 ms harris has given four performances there including one of belle the current tour began in october in seattle and is to end in newark on april 15 on april 10 the belle of amherst is to play at the mccarter theater in princeton seven performances beginning april 11 are to follow at the new jersey performing arts center when she was reached by phone last week ms harris was taking time out for a series of seven staged readings of lillian hellman 's autumn garden in los angeles but wait los angeles is not on this tour 's circuit no matter ms harris had the week off and what better way to spend it than to do a play she did the same thing last spring between one play or another she was at her home on cape cod the recent irish prize winner the beauty queen of leenane was being put on in a small theater nearby in wellfleet ms harris was in it when she was recently asked by a newspaper columnist what would you do if the world came to an end tomorrow she answered i 'd go to the theater she did not specify whether she would be onstage or in the audience say simply that if she 's not in it she sees it and her life in theater is not just an acceptance but also her own affirmation of changed times the theater world was different when ms harris was officially declared a star it was official ritualized by a name going up in lights above the theater and elevated in the program and in the advertisements from below to above a play 's title that 's how it was in 1952 when she performed in the play i am a camera now remembered mostly as the source of the musical cabaret it may be history but ms harris was the first sally bowles on screen too and it made her a theater star but not a movie star theater was then defined by broadway where ms harris starred in play after play decade after decade alas the grand empire theater where she played frankie addams no longer stands although amazingly she can still return to broadway most recently in the 1997 revival of the gin game her 10th tony nomination theater is no longer just a broadway thing in fact she toured in the gin game for the next two years ms harris goes where theater is wherever theater is in 1999 she starred in scent of the roses a new play at the theater in nyack it would be a great film role for judi dench she said why not a great film role for julie harris i 'm not a bankable name she said i 'm a theater star and she laughed the inimitable julie harris laugh the belle of amherst helen hayes

 the slogan on dennis cook 's t shirt go hard or go home is faded as is the small florida marlins logo that accompanies it the mets left hander has not been a marlin since 1997 and this is the first time in his 12 year major league career that he has been with the same team three springs in a row but the fact that he wears another team 's shirt underscores the itinerant nature of his career and his game he may be on the move again shortly cook took part in the first day of workouts for mets pitchers and catchers today and he does not know how long he will be with the team he does not particularly care either not after being traded six times in his career cook would like to stay with the mets and complete his contract which runs through next year but he is prepared just in case that does n't happen i do n't want to get my roots too set in the ground because obviously something could happen and my name 's been in the papers a lot cook said i 'm not going to think about it one way or the other just get myself in shape and ready to pitch whatever it 's going to be it 's going to be i 'm not going to fret or panic over it the mets have 24 pitchers in camp including 11 left handers there are four experienced left handed relievers cook john franco jesse orosco and rich rodriguez and other teams regularly ask about them franco expected to be the setup man for armando benitez has veto power over trades and has decided to remain a met of the remaining three the mets would save the most money by moving cook and his 22 million salary it 's just going to boil down to do they want to pay my salary as a set up guy to pitch in the middle cook said that 's the decision steve has to make steve phillips the mets general manager said he will probably trade a left hander before the regular season starts and said six or seven teams are interested the seattle mariners have shown interest in cook in the past and the cleveland indians are also looking to add left handed relief then again the mets might do nothing manager bobby valentine said he could take as many as seven left handers on an 11  or 12 man staff presumably three starters and the four relievers we might not trade any of them and we 'd have a lot of lefties phillips said that would n't be the worst thing there 's a possibility that nothing will be done and we 'll wait until a later date history shows that the mets will get the best out of cook early in the season over the last three years he has a 246 earned run average in the first half and a 441 era in the second half last season cook wore down after working 41 1 3 in the first half of the season and in the second half his era was 623 he pitched only six innings in the final months of the season dave wallace the pitching coach stopped short of saying cook was overworked last year attributing the drop off in performance to a lack of confidence but he said he planned to talk to each pitcher individually this spring and he and cook will discuss ways for the pitcher to stay effective longer it 's an awareness that you address wallace said we 'll put our heads together and figure it out asked if he learned his personal limits last year cook shook off the question go hard or go home as the t shirt says there 's no such thing as personal limits he said when the manager tells you to pitch you pitch you ca n't tell him you ca n't pitch if there 's really not a whole lot of options down there we had to win games at the beginning of the year just like at the end of the year all you can do is go hard and hopefully have some gas in the tank at the end of the year inside pitch the mets have an arbitration hearing scheduled for 9 30 am thursday in tampa fla with the closer armando benitez who surprised the team by not reporting with the rest of the pitchers and catchers for the first day of workouts wednesday benitez was in baltimore wrapping up details of his case with his agent mike powers steve phillips said there was a miscommunication between the agent and the team and benitez will be in camp friday i 'd rather have everybody here bobby valentine said but it 'll be over real quickly baseball
 to the editor the article underscored a simple truth about the risk of investing in stocks the only person taking any risk is the investor while other jobs provide compensation based upon performance the brokerage firm money manager gets a percentage of the client 's account regardless of how he or she performs until this industry comes up with a plan for equitable sharing of risk for example an incentive based fee schedule we might be better off investing only in no load index funds or steering clear of the stock market entirely george s thomas west tisbury mass july 23

 britain 's largest bus and rail operator stagecoach holdings reported a loss for the year that included a write down of its business in the united states stagecoach which owns south west trains and 49 percent of virgin rail in britain said it lost # 3165 million 443 million before taxes in contrast to a pretax profit of # 1823 million last year the loss includes a # 376 million write down of good will the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of a company 's assets related to its 1999 purchase of coach usa shares rose 11 percent in part because the company said the worst of its problems in the united states were behind and because it raised its annual dividend by 4 percent to 38 pence suzanne kapner nyt
 astronomers said on friday that they had determined the time in cosmic history when a mysterious force dark energy began to wrench the universe apart five billion years ago said dr adam riess an astronomer at the space telescope science institute in baltimore the universe experienced a cosmic jerk before then dr riess said the combined gravity of the galaxies and everything else in the cosmos was resisting the expansion slowing it down since the jerk though the universe has been speeding up the results were based on observations by a multinational team of astronomers who used the hubble space telescope to search exploding stars known as type 1a supernovas reaching back in time three quarters of the way to the big bang in which the universe was born the results should help quell remaining doubts that the expansion of the universe is really accelerating a strange sounding notion that has become a pillar of a new and widely accepted model of the universe as being full of mysterious dark matter and even more mysterious dark energy this gives great confidence that we 've been on the right track said dr riess who announced his results at a meeting here on the future of cosmology sponsored by the center for education and research in cosmology and astrophysics at case western reserve university and the kavli institute dr lawrence m krauss an astrophysicist at case western called the turnaround from slowing down to speeding up important confirmation the big surprise dr krauss said would have been if it had n't happened dr joseph lykken a physicist at the fermi national accelerator laboratory known as fermilab in batavia ill said i could go home now and be happy knowing how and when the jerk occurred astronomers said was an important step in figuring out just what the dark energy is he gave us information about when the universe hit the gas pedal said dr michael s turner a cosmologist at the university of chicago who is director of mathematics and physics at the national science foundation different theories of dark energy dr turner said predict different times for the transition the supernovae have come through dr wendy l freedman director of the carnegie observatories in pasadena calif said the whole result could have disappeared referring to the dark energy acceleration a result was also a vindication for dr riess who was a pivotal member of one of two competing groups the one led by dr brian p schmidt of the mount stromlo and siding spring observatories in australia the other team was headed by dr saul perlmutter of the lawrence berkeley laboratory of the university of california who discovered the cosmic acceleration five years ago the groups used supernovas to chart the expansion of the universe at different times in the past the goal was to measure how much the universe was being slowed by the collective gravity of the cosmos and determine whether the universe would go on forever or recollapse in a big crunch on one distant day the groups found though that nearby supernovas looked dimmer than they should implying that the universe was growing faster than expected speeding up under the influence of some form of antigravity perhaps embedded in the fabric of spacetime itself the results were buttressed by studies of radiation left over from the big bang that suggested that two thirds of the mass energy of the universe resided in this dark energy but there was always a nagging doubt dr riess told his colleagues if that was the case supernovas even farther away than the ones already observed should be even dimmer than the supernovas nearby on the other hand if it was really an antigravity energy in space then as space expanded the push from this dark energy would grow along with it in the early years of the universe the dark energy would have been too small to counteract the gravity of the matter in the universe and the expansion would have initially slowed after the universe grew big enough though the dark energy would dominate and the universe would start to expand dr riess described the difference between the matter most of which is dark and dark energy as one pulls the other pushes to test which idea was true dr riess and his colleagues had to find supernovas farther in the past than previous surveys seven billion light years ago in 2001 dr riess and his collaborators found hubble observations of a supernova 10 billion years in the past it proved to be anomalously bright lending credence to the idea that a dark energy had taken over some time in between but a single object is just not robust enough he said for the last year he and his colleagues have used the hubble in collaboration with a large galaxy survey known as goods to find distant supernovas we found lots of weapons of mass destruction he said showing hubble pictures of some exploding with the brilliance of small galaxies 8 billion to 10 billion light years away more important they were brighter than expected when he plotted their velocities against distance or time in the past dr riess found that the universe had to have changed direction from slowing to speeding up over a period of time five billion years ago the so called cosmic jerk using the technical term for a change in acceleration it 's great to see it dr riess said in dr lykken 's words and as borne out by discussions at the meeting here theorists do n't have a clue about the identity of the dark energy that is so important a leading candidate is something invented by einstein called the cosmological constant but physicists despair of understanding einstein 's constant efforts to calculate it wind up missing by a factor of 10 60 which has been called the worst mismatch in the history of science another candidate that has lately won some following among theorists is that einstein was wrong that the acceleration is sort of an illusion that could be dispelled by modifying his general theory of relativity the sourcebook of cosmic gravity the stakes for the universe are not small if the cosmological constant is the culprit the universe will expand faster and faster as time goes on it will be cold and dark in a few billion years dr frank wilczek the herman feshbach professor of physics at the massachusetts institute of technology said that would be very sad correction october 13 2003 monday because of an editing error an article on saturday about efforts to determine when dark energy began to accelerate the expansion of the universe misstated a subject about which an astronomer dr adam riess said there was nagging doubt it was that dust might be making supernovae look dimmer not that two thirds of the mass energy of the universe resides in dark energy
 to the editor i just reopened my own personal grochowski file mine was for a fridge whose freezer stopped working on the hottest day of 1999 the smell of mold and rotting food was terrifying i also made endless efforts at phoning writing and beseeching the man had made me pay in cash and i did since i was desperate i reported it to my home insurance company and they reimbursed me for my expense to the ny refrigeration company and for the legitimate repairman i eventually used the insurer did n't even ask for any documentation when i reported it to the better business bureau they were actually helpful and said that our friend mr g had 23 complaints against him already and that i should have called them first then they sent me to consumer affairs who told me to go to small claims court the judge ruled in my favor laughed and said lots of luck gregg winter manhattan

 the graduation rate for division i a football players who entered school in 1993 94 sunk to its lowest percentage since the entering class of 1985 but over all the graduation rates of student athletes surpassed those of the general student population according to a report released yesterday by the national collegiate athletic association forty eight percent of football players received their diplomas down from the 51 percent of the previous entering class the graduation rate of white football players decreased 6 percent to 55 percent while the graduation rate for black players was 42 percent the same as in the previous report we 're concerned about the decline in rates among football players said cedric dempsey the ncaa president there 's been a slow steady decline in the overall rate for this group for a number of years we need to start looking at what some of the reasons might be for this decline the report which tracks scholarship athletes and allows them six years to earn a diploma showed that student athletes graduated at a 58 percent rate which was 2 percent higher than the overall student body over all these rates are similar to those we 've been seeing for student athletes for the past several years dempsey said among the report 's other findings of the entering class of 1993 94 black female student athletes graduated at a 15 percent higher rate than black females in the general student population the largest difference in rates between student athletes and the general population their graduation rate was 57 percent a 4 percent increase white female student athletes and black male student athletes continue to graduate at significantly higher rates than their counterparts in the overall student body white female athletes graduated at a 71 percent rate compared with the white female student body rate of 61 percent black male athletes graduated at a 41 percent rate compared with 32 percent for black males in the student body as in previous years division i a male basketball players and football players graduated at rates significantly lower than the student body basketball players graduated at a 42 percent rate compared with 54 percent of the male student body football players were at 48 percent male student athletes graduated at a 51 percent rate while female student athletes earned their diploma at a 68 percent rate versus the 59 percent rate of the female student body
 jerrod riggan has kept a diary since the first week of march recording his experiences and putting his spiritual beliefs in writing riggan a rookie right hander for the mets will one day reflect on his entries from this week in houston where he lost two extra inning games for the first decisions of his big league career the pages will describe the first lessons in losing of a young player 's major league life armando benitez blew the save in the ninth inning tonight and riggan lost the game in the 10th when moises alou rolled a single up the middle to give the astros a 4 3 victory at enron field all three games in the series lasted 10 innings and craig biggio scored the winning run against riggan tonight and tuesday the mets won wednesday 's game in the moments after the game riggan grasped the lesson he would learn from this week telling himself that losses like these would make him stronger in his diary he said he planned to write good things come to those who wait but knowing that did not soothe him tonight right now it 's like getting dragged by your feet across gravel he said you feel like you let down 24 people the mets think highly of riggan and he is pitching in the late innings because the mets traded the veteran turk wendell to the philadelphia phillies last week riggan has been called up from class aaa norfolk five times this year and even with wendell gone he knows he must perform to stay i 'll just have to rise above it i guess and hopefully get another chance he said biggio who homered off riggan on tuesday led off the 10th tonight with a single and went to second on a sacrifice bunt riggan walked jeff bagwell intentionally and nearly got out of the inning when lance berkman grounded to short for a potential inning ending double play but the ball was hit softly and second baseman edgardo alfonzo could not get a good grip on the ball as he hurried his relay throw and bounced it in front of first baseman todd zeile but berkman had crossed first by then even if i made a strong throw to first it was going to be close alfonzo said alou then grounded a slider up the middle past riggan whose delivery pulls him off the mound toward first alfonzo knocked the ball down and tried to throw to second while on his back for an inning ending force out but he never got a throw off biggio scored and the astros won benitez had a chance to close out the game and get a victory for steve trachsel who allowed only three hits and one run over seven innings benitez converted his first 24 save opportunities this season but he blew the save sunday and again tonight i feel real sorry for trachsel benitez said he threw a real good game for seven innings i come in i do n't do my job today no excuse benitez allowed a leadoff single in the ninth to bagwell then walked berkman alou then fell behind 0 2 but fouled off two pitches and drew a walk to load the bases benitez almost always withers with the bases loaded and he did so again daryle ward struck out looking but pinch hitter orlando merced pulled a double to right field scoring two runs to tie the game at 3 3 an intentional walk loaded the bases again but an unwise base running decision got the mets out of the inning jose vizcaino flied out to shallow left and alou tagged up challenging tsuyoshi shinjo 's strong arm shinjo who made a running basket catch with his back to home plate in the fourth threw a one hop strike that arrived well before alou who was tagged out to end the inning still over the last two years opposing hitters are 7 for 12 with four homers off benitez with the bases loaded in that situation i try to be focused and make my pitches benitez said i got a chance to get a fly ball and got out of the inning the mets scored all of their runs off pedro astacio who made his debut for the astros after coming over in a deal from colorado on tuesday 's trading deadline nelson cruz and mike williams 3 4 shut down the mets for two and two thirds innings the outcome took the attention off trachsel who has a 329 earned run average in 10 starts since returning from class aaa norfolk in june he is 3 0 with a 157 era in four starts since the all star game break trachsel has turned around his season and other players have two months to do the same riggan has pitched in 16 games and has mostly pitched well but he is also searching he will write out his thoughts and read the words of others riggan said he was reading the book secrets of success i have n't started it yet he said inside pitch the mets have played three consecutive extra inning games for the first time since aug 18 20 1982 they had not played three extra inning games in a row against the same team since may 5 7 1980 against the cincinnati reds
 to the editor the portrayal of dogs up for adoption in the essay by laurie lico albanese soapbox dec 16 was quite disturbing it 's too bad she would never consider adopting a pit bull a three legged mongrel or any dog that snorts her way through a walk or would so rudely show no interest in her as with any dog a properly trained and loved pit bull can be a wonderful pet and also like any dog if it is taught to be vicious and violent it will be just that i wonder if ms albanese ever thought how that three legged mongrel became three legged or of the pain it endured when it lost its leg as for the dog that snorted when she walked it did she ever stop to think about the ailment or the discomfort the dog must experience when it expends energy i do n't blame any dog for not showing interest in her as she complains sharing your life with a dog is not a cheap antidote to the anxiety of uncertain times it is a wonderful addition to any life as well as a beautiful example for our children of the giving and receiving of unconditional love i hope for her sake that she never loses her looks and becomes one of those mongrels she feels is unworthy of love ellie fried short hills
 jason kidd had been given warnings about tampering from the national basketball association and a lecture on the same subject from nets general manager rod thorn although he spoke cautiously today it was clear who would be on his mind sunday when the denver nuggets arrived at the meadowlands to play the nets kidd made it clear last summer that he would love to be reunited with antonio mcdyess the 6 foot 9 forward he played with in phoenix and on the united states olympic team mcdyess is expected to be with the nuggets on sunday though he has been sidelined by an injury the entire season asked today if he might be host to a dinner for mcdyess kidd unfurled a knowing smile that would n't be a bad idea he said if the nets were to make the long rumored deal this summer kidd would undoubtedly welcome the addition of mcdyess who averaged 208 points and 121 rebounds a game last season i have n't had a chance to talk to him unfortunately kidd said but this is a guy we have a friendship that 's grown playing on the olympic team and i had an opportunity to play with him in phoenix so he is considered a friend of mine i 've talked to him in the past just to see how he 's doing outside the game of basketball too mcdyess was sidelined after surgery on oct 12 to repair the patella tendon in his left knee he was expected to return last week but soreness in his knee and a lack of practice have stalled his season debut he 's the type of guy who 's going to get you 20 25 points and 10 to 15 rebounds every night so that 's a big part of their team that 's gone nets coach byron scott said he 's been gone for the whole season and i think that 's one of the reasons why they 've been struggling mcdyess may be trade bait this summer but the more immediate talk surrounds nick van exel who will sit out sunday 's game with a sore elbow and raef lafrentz van exel 's problems with the nuggets have accelerated trade speculation this week and lafrentz 's solid play has served as an enticement to other teams but the nets 33 17 after pounding the depleted chicago bulls 106 81 on friday night are concerned with their own play not who is dressing for denver denver 16 32 defeated minnesota 99 98 on friday and scott said so they played pretty good without those guys the nets played without kenyon martin on friday and might do so again sunday after aggravating an injury to his right forearm on thursday martin had a magnetic resonance imaging exam friday it revealed a strained ligament the team had a light workout today and martin said the pain he experienced made it unlikely that he would play sunday i 'll see how it feels in the morning martin said the way i feel right now i do n't think so scott said when he was shooting today it seemed like he looked ok after he got warmed up a little bit his first five or six shots were real short but he seemed like he got a little looser and shot better

 susan madakor was hoping for a free lunch but got frozen assets instead when a judge in manhattan ruled yesterday that she could not spend the remainder of 700000 that was accidentally transferred into her bank account ms madakor a single mother in brooklyn was a receptionist at a manhattan textile firm eking out a living and wading through credit card debt until a bizarre windfall in 1998 led her to make grand plans claiming that she believed she had won an international lottery that deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars directly into her account ms madakor bought a laundry business for 100000 set up a college fund for her 10 year old son paid off 30000 in credit card debt furnished a new apartment leased a minivan and began negotiating to buy a liquor store the only problem was the money did not come from a lottery it was to have been deposited in a united nations account for a fund that rescues endangered plants and animals but landed in ms madakor 's account at chase manhattan bank instead her account number varied from the united nations fund 's account by one digit now her windfall the 701998 that came in 13 wire transfers from more than six countries is the object of a remarkable international tussle involving the united nations chase manhattan and ms madakor yesterday justice barry cozier of state supreme court in manhattan rejected a request by ms madakor 's lawyer to unfreeze the assets which she had come to rely on instead justice cozier said the case represented unjust enrichment and that ms madakor had evidence that she was not the legitimate owner of the funds spokesmen for chase manhattan and the united nations expressed relief over the decision but the ultimate question of what will happen to the remaining 450000 and the money ms madakor has already spent remains unanswered we regret that ms madakor has taken the unusual position of suing us for money that is n't hers said ken herz a chase manhattan bank spokesman when the united nations discovered the misplaced money it notified chase manhattan which froze ms madakor 's account the united nations sounded a similar note yesterday as far as we 're concerned the money was intended for the protection of plant and animal species said fred eckhard a united nations spokesman it was n't intended to buy a laundromat ms madakor 's lawyer michael siegel said his client thought she had won an international lottery and was overwhelmed by the experience as well as the devastating aftermath of her plans falling to pieces it would be like someone sold you the brooklyn bridge then you look in the records and it was deeded to you then chase gives her a private banker obviously ratifying her experience on a daily basis said mr siegel it remained unclear yesterday who was to blame for the erroneous transfers mr herz of chase manhattan refused to comment on it while ms madakor 's lawyer and a united nations spokesman said it was still being investigated the united nations said that it would take all necessary legal action to recover the money

 when greg maddux walked into the braves clubhouse today someone mentioned that the team had a security meeting at 3 o'clock oh yeah the pitcher said rocker 's pitching no john rocker the inflammatory atlanta closer was not the reason for the meeting nearly two months ago kevin hallinan head of security for major league baseball had scheduled today as the day he would meet with the braves on his annual spring training tour with incredible coincidence the meeting wound up on the day rocker made his first exhibition appearance suspended for comments he made about whole segments of society rocker pitched one inning against the detroit tigers tonight receiving a standing ovation from most of the fans then spoke as combatively about the news media as he had about the people he disparaged first he said he was speaking to reporters and television cameras only because manager bobby cox had asked him to if it were up to me i would n't he said then commenting on the fans overall positive reaction he said the best thing i got out of that it showed you people in the media that not everybody 's against me i 've been running into nothing but positives ever since all this stuff has happened wherever he has gone the 25 year old closer said atlanta mexico arkansas new orleans he was well received yet he said every night i turn the tv on and see how horrible a person everyone says i am rocker was n't supposed to be in camp with the braves tonight well not if commissioner bud selig had anything to do with it selig had suspended the left hander for all of spring training and the first four weeks of the season but baseball 's impartial arbitrator shyam das slashed the suspension from 73 days to 14 the first two weeks of the season rocker arrived in camp march 2 nearly two weeks after all of the team 's other pitchers but he exhibited no signs tonight of being behind dashing from the bullpen to the mound to the accompaniment of a standing ovation that drowned out a few scattered boos from the crowd of 10078 a record for the three year old disney stadium rocker unleashed his fastball as soon as gregg jefferies the first batter stepped into the box his first pitch a fastball high and outside was clocked at 95 miles an hour i told everybody i was going to throw 75 80 percent let myself get in shape first rocker said i ca n't pitch like that i 've tried it and i ca n't do it last year i came out and threw really hard early on and by about april 10 or 15 my elbow was hurting pretty bad i had to take about two weeks off but i ca n't throw half speed i do n't know how to rocker retired all three batters he faced with a total of 14 pitches closing out the braves 4 0 victory saying he was disappointed with his control but pleased with his stuff rocker said it just seemed like another night to me once again the media tried to make a big deal out of it it was an inning in a meaningless spring training game he will pitch next in venezuela saturday against tampa bay appearing before a crowd of people who were one of the groups he disparaged in a magazine interview that led to the disciplinary action against him his incendiary words are expected to follow him into and perhaps throughout the season and create potential security problems obviously i 'll be monitoring the situation hallinan said before his meeting with the braves many of the braves players said nothing unusual has occurred with rocker in camp attributing the absence of ill feeling to their desire to play as a team and return to the world series i do n't think there is tom glavine said when asked if there was a problem with rocker what guys say publicly and privately are maybe different things but i have n't heard from anybody privately who has a problem in the immediate aftermath of the publication of rocker 's remarks brian jordan became one of his severest critics everybody 's going about their business which is the way it 's supposed to be the right fielder said today no sense holding it against him who says you have to like everybody you play with it 's never been the case in any professional sport he 's under the microscope jordan said we 're going to see how he reacts if he keeps his mouth shut catcher eddie perez said we 're going to be ok

 the four men gathered one night last month at a restaurant in vero beach fla over a meal of steak pasta and red wine they had become friends over the years and their discussions transcended shop talk but in this instance they knew the conversation would quickly turn to the art of pitching sandy koufax al leiter tom glavine and john franco were the four who met for dinner that night a sort of roundtable of lefties with decades of success on the mound as the dinner wore on it became clear to three of them what they had truly united for to razz leiter koufax the hall of famer has long implored leiter to pitch away from hitters but it was not until glavine arrived in february for his first spring training with the mets that leiter began trying to mimic glavine 's signature changeup leiter focused so much on incorporating that pitch into his repertory of cut fastballs that when koufax later visited the mets camp he chided leiter for listening to glavine after koufax had been telling him the same thing for years most of us were bashing al glavine recalled with a smile al was the black sheep of the table glavine will need that kind of humor to overcome days like monday when his first start for the mets deteriorated into a 15 2 season opening loss to the chicago cubs leiter will try to turn things around for the mets when he pitches the second game of the season tonight through trying times this year the two can probably refer back to that dinner for perspective and support the dinner was clearly an exclusive event koufax leiter glavine and franco did not need to post a no right handers sign on the door to the restaurant they sat in the main dining room of one of koufax 's favorite haunts the three mets pitchers did not reveal the name of the restaurant for fear of jeopardizing koufax 's well guarded privacy occasionally taking breaks to sign autographs what took place that night no doubt warmed the heart of fred wilpon the mets owner and koufax 's childhood friend wilpon too is a left hander and he pitched for lafayette high school in brooklyn while koufax played first base it is no exaggeration to say that five of the most important and influential people in the mets hierarchy these days are left handed pitchers past and present franco who is also a lafayette alumnus and is currently on the disabled list is the longest tenured met on the roster leiter is right behind him glavine was personally courted by wilpon and koufax is well koufax he has been a regular visitor to the mets camp for years glavine was signed by wilpon to be the ace of the staff and a clubhouse leader he failed on the first count on opening day although it appears he is having no trouble in adjusting to new york less than two hours before monday 's game glavine conducted a television interview by his locker a pregame ritual that starting pitchers usually avoid glavine and leiter give the mets a left leaning top of the rotation similar to the one in 2000 when leiter and mike hampton led the mets to the world series hampton like glavine on monday had trouble getting the ball over the plate in the mets opener that season but he ended up being named the most valuable player of the national league championship series koufax was one of the first people to call glavine last december to congratulate him on signing with the mets acting as a sort of emissary for wilpon and easing the shock for glavine of leaving the braves after 16 years when the mets introduced glavine at a news conference wilpon said that koufax was high on glavine because he thought he had the kind of delivery the kind of arm the kind of stuff that was lasting leiter glavine and franco spoke glowingly as they described that dinner conversation and the three marveled at koufax 's pitching career with the dodgers and appreciated his willingness to offer his help 37 years after he retired at age 31 glavine believes koufax would be a pitching coach if the job did not force him into the public eye franco recalled how koufax spoke at the dinner of how he gripped a baseball where he stood on the mound and how hard he threw his curveball anybody has to be an idiot not to want to sit down and listen to the way he talks and the way he thinks about pitching franco said when you 're sitting there you 're just absorbing everything franco has told koufax how his father was a dodgers fan early in koufax 's career before the team moved from brooklyn to los angeles if he was alive today knowing i was sitting down having a pretty good relationship with sandy he 'd be tickled pink franco said the mets this season can essentially provide a left handed tutor for virtually every type of pitcher franco 42 has more saves 422 than any other left hander and he has done it mostly with a changeup glavine 37 forces hitters to lean for his changeup or his sinker like koufax glavine is a believer in living outside as leiter calls it koufax 67 threw very hard and away using his curveball to change speeds leiter 37 who picked up the check that night throws harder than glavine or franco and is a rarity a left hander who throws inside his cut fastball breaks bats and backs off hitters and because his body is so conditioned to throwing cutters leiter said he needs to change his entire mind set to throw to the other side of the plate the three mets pitchers considered themselves fortunate to have dinner with koufax but the really lucky mets might be the pitchers who are young and left handed mike bacsik a left handed reliever said he has spoken with leiter on throwing inside with franco on the changeup and with glavine on setting up hitters if he could throw a curveball like koufax bacsik said he would be truly successful it 's like taking the advanced classes instead of the basic classes said bacsik who had a rough outing in the mets opener as for wilpon he said he has never asked koufax to assist with the mets that koufax offers his time voluntarily i think the distinguishing difference about this group of people is they are able to share their knowledge wilpon said of koufax leiter franco and glavine of the younger left handers on the team wilpon said if you 're smart you do a lot of listening
 to the sports editor robert lipsyte 's column an old crusade continues into the new century jan 23 reminded me one more time of one of the finest toughest and most accomplished athletes and sportsmen of the last century who was embarrassingly overlooked by all of the major top athlete lists the wrestler dan gable was undefeated in high school and college an astounding 181 0 before he lost the ncaa title in his final bout as a senior at iowa state university in 1970 he was undefeated and unscored upon when he won the olympic gold medal in the 1972 games he coached the university of iowa to an unprecedented 18 national titles 15 as head coach 3 as assistant coach including a remarkable 9 titles in a row william baldwin new york
 representative dick armey the house majority leader called today for a rapid reduction in income tax rates to help head off a recession giving a lift to president elect george w bush 's proposal for a broad package of tax cuts in a memorandum to republicans in the house mr armey said the party 's priorities should be a reduction in all income tax rates the centerpiece of mr bush 's plan and expanding individual retirement accounts and 401 k retirement savings plans a measure that overwhelmingly passed the house last year only to die in the senate the cuts he said should be enacted promptly and should be retroactive to the start of this year mr bush 's aides are considering accelerating their 16 trillion tax cut plan which as first formulated would not take effect until 2002 though they have made a big tax cut a primary goal republican leaders in congress have been lukewarm until now in their support for an across the board reduction in income tax rates in part because most benefits would go to the wealthiest taxpayers many republicans have indicated a preference for measures like repealing the federal estate tax and giving a tax cut to married couples but the bad economic news in recent weeks has provided mr bush with an argument in favor of rate cuts one that mr armey expanded on today it is vitally important that congress move quickly to enact a pro growth tax cut that could help avert a recession he wrote some are arguing that we should put off the income tax rate cut until later in the year i disagree the income tax rate cut must move first whether alone or as part of a larger tax cut package democrats have blocked most republican tax cutting efforts over the past few years senator tom daschle of south dakota the party 's leader in the senate and representative charles b rangel of manhattan the ranking democrat on the house ways and means committee signaled today that they remained opposed to the approach advocated by mr armey but with the economy slowing and the federal budget surplus continuing to grow opposition to tax cuts among democrats is softening and democratic leaders are considering offering their own tax relief packages possibly built around a reduction in the bottom income tax rate of 15 percent there is a growing sentiment that a tax cut may very well be necessary said michael siegel a spokesman for senator max baucus of montana the senior democrat on the finance committee but he added democrats would insist that any tax cuts be reasonable equitable and not interfere with our ability to pay down the debt shore up social security and medicare and provide a prescription drug benefit to seniors in one indication of changing attitudes among democrats toward tax cuts felix g rohatyn the financier and former ambassador to france said last week he believed a substantial tax reduction now would be good economic policy it would not be a bad thing to have a reasonable tax reduction now he said not so much because it will stimulate the economy overnight but because taxes are relatively high and we can afford a tax cut of one kind or another
 the on horse racing column yesterday about this year 's top 3 year old horses misstated the date of the florida derby it is march 10 not may 11
 while they were able to focus financially on alex rodriguez for the first time yesterday the mets have not lost sight of their own free agents whom they want to sign phil tannenbaum pitcher rick reed 's agent said yesterday that he spoke friday night to general manager steve phillips who made a revised offer for reed tannenbaum did not disclose details of the new offer but the mets were believed to have held at three years while raising the money part of it from 18 million to about 21 million tannenbaum has talked about a four year deal for 32 million which is what the mets gave al leiter in 1998 tannenbaum said he had told phillips that he and reed would review the new offer and get back to him in the meantime reed can entertain offers from other teams tannenbaum speaking by telephone from his home in houston said he had had conceptual discussions with five or six other teams and would talk to those teams this week bobby j jones is another right handed starter for the mets who is now a free agent jeff moorad jones 's agent said that he had been contacted by the mets and that he had told them that jones 's preference was to remain with the team and that he was basically willing to wait until the mets got other bigger issues out of the way before negotiating a contract reed and jones are among the second tier of starting pitchers available as free agents mike hampton and mike mussina are the first tier the mets have interest in both though rodriguez appears to be their no 1 target in the open market which means their pursuit of the pitchers will most likely have to wait mussina 's agent arn tellem said yesterday that the mets and the yankees had expressed interest in his client neither team he said has jumped in with a quick offer the process is just beginning tellem said by telephone from los angeles the yankees appear to have made mussina their priority among free agents even ahead of manny ramirez knowing that they have dominated baseball the past five years primarily on the strength of their pitching they want to make their starting rotation even more solid and deeper than it has been i 've spoken to the yankees and i could say they are a team that is very interested in him tellem said a lot depends on where we go with a deal but obviously they fit his criteria a great team a great organization they 're committed to winning he 's friendly with some of the players he 's met over the years and it has the other advantage of being close to home tellem said he talked friday with the yankees and expected to talk with them again very soon mussina has said in the past that he did not like the idea of playing in new york but tellem said players get a different view of the area when they live there rather than spend three days at a hotel in manhattan mike is from a small town tellem said speaking of montoursville pa now that 's he 's a free agent he 's totally open to it he 's aware he could live in area outside the city and yet be near the city as with all high priced free agents mussina certainly would like the yankees to be open to making a strong offer to him any time the yankees pursue a free agent he can count on a spirited and economically advantageous result besides the yankees and the mets other teams that are expected to seek mussina are boston cleveland st louis texas and los angeles many of the same teams interested in mussina will be talking to hampton 's agent as well that list includes the mets who allowed their period of exclusivity with hampton to pass without improving the offer they made him last february phillips said he wanted to wait to see where the market takes hampton he will find out soon enough perhaps at the same time he finds out what rodriguez will cost
 miguel tejada of the oakland athletics left yankee stadium last night with a 167 batting average and a future so uncertain that he recently voiced concerns that he might be traded that notion is borderline preposterous at least as long as the a 's are in contention but tejada will be a free agent after this season and oakland is unlikely to re sign him tejada selected the american league 's most valuable player last season insisted last night that he was focused and wanted to return to oakland but he did not dismiss the idea of playing for the yankees right now i 'm not really thinking about going anywhere said tejada who went 1 for 4 last night right now i 'm just thinking about being here i just want to win and i do n't think about any place that i want to go i 'm happy to play with oakland but next year i 'm going to be a free agent if the yankees are interested in me i 'm going to listen to them the free agent market will be dazzling next winter with tejada montreal outfielder vladimir guerrero and chicago white sox pitcher bartolo colon and philadelphia phillies pitcher kevin millwood among the stars on the market the yankees always look into premium free agents and tejada is a long shot possibility despite his position tejada has never played anywhere but shortstop and he would have to switch to third to play for the yankees jason giambi his former oakland teammate suggested in spring training that tejada could do that with robin ventura a free agent and drew henson progressing so slowly the yankees will have an opening tejada was noncommittal when asked if he would consider changing positions i really love playing shortstop and right now i feel like i can still play shortstop he said let 's see after the year is over where i 've got my mind

 they are at the age where this year could be the last in a baseball career and like two old fishing buddies dangling lines from a pier david cone and paul o'neill have stood in the outfield during batting practice this spring and had big picture conversations about their team and its niche in history as the yankees open the season here monday against the anaheim angels they have a chance to win three consecutive championships something no team has accomplished since the oakland athletics of 1972 74 and something no team has done since the advent of free agency made it more difficult to maintain a dynasty derek jeter is 25 years old and said he has n't thought much about those questions for him winning championships is an annual event you pay your taxes in april and you win a world series in october but o'neill and cone realize they are at a different time and place in their careers and in a sense they have thought about what their professional eulogies will be if you win three straight you put an asterisk by those teams o'neill said i 'd love to be part of one of those and associated with one of those i do n't care how long your career is you could play 15 years but if you could play on a team that wins three championships that 's how you 're going to be remembered cone said we 're both very proud of what 's gone on here and we 're both fiercely proud of the run we 've had i like what 's being said about the yankees it 's a throwback team a selfless group a likable group i just feel good when i hear people say this is a team that 's tough to hate that says a lot because the yankees are very easy to hate but it 's difficult to beat them they are an older team now and there were games last year when it seemed as if the kansas city royals minnesota twins and even the boston red sox made them look lethargic but the yankees always seem to have a sense of where they are and what they need to do having struggled through parts of the 1999 season the yankees blistered their postseason opponents winning 11 out of 12 games leaving the atlanta braves in awe after their four game sweep of the world series joe torre their manager has said that pitching is the foundation of the yankees and from the no 1 starter orlando hernandez who will pitch the season opener to middle relief the yankees still have the most experience the most talent the most depth of any american league staff with cone roger clemens andy pettitte and others all backed by mariano rivera the best closer in the game chuck knoblauch jeter and o'neill the first three hitters in the lineup all played well in the spring and jorge posada who is in his first year as a full time front line catcher performed exceptionally in the last two weeks ricky ledee led the club with seven homers there are question marks too about how well first baseman tino martinez will perform in what could be his last season with the team and whether shane spencer will hit enough to hold the job as designated hitter but the yankees will once again be favored to win the world series and they will be compared with that oakland team all summer and perhaps into the fall those oakland athletics of the early 1970 's became the first team o'neill rooted for the first team that really drew him to baseball he loved their garish green and gold uniforms their mustaches owner charlie finley gave bonuses to any player who grew one and all the great players with all their great names cone too spoke of the lure of those monikers oakland had vida blue blue moon odom catfish hunter and reggie and rollie and bert campaneris and sal bando they had it all pitching defense power speed said goose gossage who pitched against the athletics while playing for the chicago white sox they were a team of great competitors that knew how to play the game that 's one of the best teams up against any team ever hunter ken holtzman and blue the team 's top three starting pitchers combined to win 171 games over those three seasons in 1973 each won 20 or more games in 1974 when oakland defeated los angeles in the world series for its third consecutive title hunter and holtzman were 28 years old blue was 24 the ace reliever rollie fingers eventually inducted into the hall of fame was 27 reggie jackson a special assistant with the yankees now was oakland 's right fielder and the american league 's most valuable player in 1973 we had better pitching than the current yankees jackson said it was like we had cone and clemens in their prime we had a great defensive ball club because we were together so long everyone knew each other so well guys knew where the second baseman was going to be on a cut off play we were good and efficient a lot of talent and efficient the oakland club was a better offensive club than this yankees team but the players union was gaining strength in its fight with owners and piece by piece the a 's crumbled hunter left after the 1974 season after winning an arbitrator 's decision jackson was traded before the 1976 season and free agency began in the fall of 1976 the a 's finished in last place in 1977 nobody would 've beaten us if they did n't break our club up jackson said they broke our club up and that 's the only reason why we did n't keep winning the a 's were very different from the current yankees in their clubhouse interaction they fought with each other and with finley who fought with his managers dick williams led oakland to titles in 1972 and 1973 and was replaced by alvin dark for the 1974 season these yankees are unusually harmonious quiet understated but intense we did n't play any harder than this team jackson said this team here you do n't play any harder than that they play very efficient baseball very professional team they get the home run when they have to they get the bunt down when they need to they get the save when they need to they get the good play when they need to the leadership has a lot to do with it i really think torre has a lot to do with it i think george steinbrenner has a lot to do with it i think there 's a quiet leadership about the field general that has a very very positive impact that keeps the players all pulling in a positive direction o'neill smiled when told of jackson 's feelings for that team and he understood in 25 years o'neill will feel as strongly about these yankees he 'll have the same pride o'neill and others acknowledge the yankees feel less external pressure than last year when they constantly faced questions about whether they could equal their 125 victory performance for the regular season and postseason of 1998 but through the summer the yankees desire to refine their own legacy particularly among the veterans like o'neill cone clemens knoblauch and bernie williams will build as it did in the second half of 1998 knoblauch said we 've put ourselves in position to really place our stamp on history
 barry bonds insisted he had no favorite world series memories indeed he never paid attention when he was growing up even though his father and his godfather were in the business as a child you have favorites bonds said when your favorites are n't in it you 're not watching it his father bobby an excellent player never reached the world series his godfather willie mays a great player never hit a home run in four world series last night barry bonds slugged one out in his first at bat to give his giants a running start in their 4 3 victory over the angels last year when he set the record with 73 home runs bonds was invited to throw out the first pitch of a series game as he recounted that memory the other day he made it sound as if he had merely been fulfilling an obligation for bonds the best and indeed the only way to encounter the world series is to take his powerful compact swing and propel the ball 418 feet over a distant fence and flip his bat casually and jog around the bases this was already an all barry all the time world series even before he came to the plate with his intelligence his haughty attitude bonds was dominating the series just by being here for the first time very much at his peak at the age of 38 now he has become only the 26th player to hit a home run on his first at bat in the world series and he has also accomplished something that ted williams that other great left fielder was not able to do in his only world series appearance in 1946 this was an instant world series memory for the red swathed fans clacking their ubiquitous plastic thunderstix celebrating the angels first world series in 41 years of existence the fans also saw j t snow of the giants who played four years here flop on his back while chasing a foul pop only to spring back up to catch the ball in front of the giants dugout the fans will remember his acrobatics and they will also remember his crushing two run homer an inning later but they clacked on incessantly like rabid red insects performing some weird mating call and the famed rally monkey pranced around on the message board the noise and the monkey are bound to be part of this world series memory too before the series began some of the angels had shared their personal world series memories mike scioscia the personable manager recalled being in catholic school and having a tv brought in and turned on so we could tune in to a little bit of the world series next day it was a radio he said it was an event not knowing the specifics of the players maybe at the time i was very young but knowing it was a world series and watching it it was incredible that 's my first recollection in the early part of the last century fans congregated in town squares or in front of railroad stations while the play by play came clicking across the western union wires people devised scoreboards and posted the results pitch after pitch then tv came along and fans could watch at home jarrod washburn who gave up bonds 's first series home run last night has been loving the postseason ever since he was verbally abused by the vicious hilarious knowledgeable fans before the first game in yankee stadium a few weeks ago now he has survived longer than the louts in the bronx and is living out the dreams of his childhood in northern wisconsin i grew up close to minneapolis and the metrodome washburn said with visible joy so '87 and '91 the twins kirby puckett viola hrbek that jumped catch against the wall that kirby made then gagne faking that guy those were some great world series to watch washburn never even mentioned kent hrbek 's forcing ron gant off first base with the sheer bulk of his body then tagging him for a vital out of the 1991 series against the braves a better pro wrestling move than the state 's future governor jesse ventura ever choreographed in his real career many players although not barry bonds watch the series even after they have reached the major leagues the postseason the playoff games they 're hit and miss admitted tim salmon the effervescent right fielder for the angels who like all his teammates is participating in his first world series you always try from your living room couch to imagine what it would be like playing in those situations in those games the energy the excitement salmon said salmon 's enthusiasm for the world series is a throwback to when the event was an all or nothing take it or leave it championship at the end of the regular season right through 1968 now there are 30 teams with 8 surviving into the postseason making the giants and the angels with all their newcomer energy the first two wild card teams to reach the world series together nowadays the world series never starts before the sun has long gone in

 seton hall completed a turbulent and painful three day sequence tonight with an emotional victory over 25th ranked notre dame the 15th ranked pirates 78 76 victory meant volumes for their confidence and perhaps provided renewed cohesion it was their first victory over a ranked opponent in four attempts eddie griffin the pirates best player and arguably the top freshman in the country and the senior reserve kevin wilkins each served a one game suspension for an incident in the locker room saturday following seton hall 's loss to georgetown in washington following an on court dispute griffin punched his teammate the junior guard ty shine in the face according to a person with knowledge of the incident shine required stitches to close a wound below his right eye and wore a bandage during tonight 's game wilkins was suspended for shoving the freshman forward marcus toney el during the altercation according to the person who spoke on condition of anonymity andre barrett the seton hall freshman guard said the pirates might benefit from the incident because everybody got to speak their opinions and this brought our team together as one instead of breaking us apart seton hall 11 3 2 1 big east was led by darius lane 's 22 points and barrett 's 20 points barrett 's 3 pointer with 3 minutes 10 seconds left gave seton hall a 75 73 lead the eighth lead change in the final 12 minutes neither team scored again until shine broke free for a layup with 277 seconds left but five seconds later shine fouled matt carroll on a 3 point attempt and carroll made all three free throws to draw notre dame within 1 at 77 76 barrett made one of two foul shots before notre dame 9 4 1 2 made one final push the irish missed three shots before getting the ball on an inbound pass behind their basket with 17 seconds left martin ingelsby threw the ball to david graves at the top of the key graves a 40 percent 3 point shooter fired a one handed heave that clanged off the front of the rim and then off the glass to end the game that caused the student section to spill onto the court and ended an emotional stretch for the pirates it climaxed with a two hour team meeting after the pirates returned to campus saturday night griffin said he spoke with shine directly griffin and wilkins each apologized to the team during the meeting lane said but griffin had a different version it was n't like an apology was needed griffin said explaining the incident as something happened between teammates griffin watched the game in dress clothes from the pirates bench and later spoke at his locker before a seton hall official directed reporters away griffin was not about to label his behavior saturday as a regression he was dismissed from roman catholic high school because of a fight in school during his senior season last year he missed the end of the season and was forced to earn his diploma on his own seton hall coach tommy amaker who issued a four paragraph statement stating that the suspensions were for violations of team standards wanted to end this painful chapter of his season as quickly as possible and he cut off one question about whether the feelings would linger shine is apparently still hurt by the incident usually one of the more approachable players he left before reporters entered the room as did many of his teammates lane shine 's close friend said shine was still upset but trying to move on what would you think lane said you have to ask ty but i know i would n't be ok if i was him lane and barrett each hoped the pirates could benefit by letting whatever feelings were festering come out and players have apparently struggled to adjust to a team revolving around the three freshmen starters griffin barrett and toney el shine the star of seton hall 's run to the round of 16 last season has remained a backup behind barrett shine played just three minutes in the second half tonight still griffin noticed a difference from his new perspective i think the attitude on this team changed and i think you can see it on the floor said griffin who leads seton hall with 196 points 132 rebounds and 53 blocks a game notre dame 's troy murphy the forward from nearby morristown nj who turned down a chance to enter the national basketball association draft last summer made just 3 of 11 shots in the first half before carrying notre dame he scored 17 of his 25 points after halftime repeatedly banging his way inside he also grabbed 20 rebounds yet griffin 's absence was felt everywhere the game attracted a horde of nba scouts but seton hall 's best player was not allowed on the court
 the third down defense one of the few causes of concern for the jets in an otherwise feel good preseason was given a boost today when coach herman edwards said that john abraham the pro bowl defensive end was expected to be ready for the season opener sept 8 at buffalo abraham who partly tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee aug 3 practiced for the first time monday and felt no lingering effects of the injury he practiced again today and participated in some contact work edwards said that barring a setback abraham would be healthy enough to play in pass rushing situations his specialty when the regular season begins the more he practices especially because he has to get used to the brace the more he can change directions edwards said he 's able to really lean on the corner and get around there the more confidence he gains in himself the faster he 'll start playing the jets will use whatever abraham can give them on saturday the giants converted 8 of 13 third down opportunities for first downs against the jets the 62 percent conversion rate displeased edwards the pass rush has felt abraham 's absence except in isolated cases it has failed to pressure the quarterback it has brought back memories of the playoff game against oakland in january when abraham was ill and the pass rush languished in the locker room with him that is why the jets want to make sure abraham is at full strength before reintroducing him to practice and games he was hurt in a full contact goal line play in practice and he will be kept out of those practices for at least a few more days edwards said he would not play against the philadelphia eagles on friday night the jets final preseason game abraham has not played in any of the preseason games abraham will wear a brace in practices and also in games he said he seldom thought about the oakland game he is delighted to return and said he was already comfortable wearing the brace because he wore one in college for a similar injury in the same leg he said he had no fear of reinjuring the knee that was my hope when i first got hurt to be back for the first game abraham said him saying something like that just encourages me that i 'm doing well and everything is going all right my confidence level is high even when i was hurt i was confident i would be back i 'm on pace to do that i just want to see how my contribution fits in i hope i 'll be able to fit in perfectly how everybody is playing together for his teammates there is no question abraham will fit in he 's definitely missed nickel back ray mickens said his presence will definitely be felt you just have confidence that somebody will get to the quarterback if they double team him it leaves someone else open abraham said he did not want to press himself too much in his return although he would like to go full speed in practice speed of course is abraham 's greatest asset my speed gets me there but my mind tells me where to go abraham said i might not move as fast as i was before but once i get used to the brace everything will be ok extra points the jets are close to completing a contract extension for running back curtis martin general manager terry bradway said it was possible a deal could be signed this week i hate to say for sure until it 's for sure bradway said the extension will be for at least seven years the agent eugene parker said and it will allow martin to finish his career with the jets the deal will include a signing bonus in excess of 10 million we have a mutual goal and that is to have curtis martin remain a jet for the rest of his career parker said st louis running back marshall faulk who is a year older than martin recently signed a seven year deal worth 4395 million it included a 93 million bonus a new contract will give the jets needed salary cap relief martin would have counted nearly 20 million against the cap over the next two seasons without a new contract once the jets clear the space they can move ahead on discussions for new contracts for center kevin mawae and receiver wayne chrebet proposals have been exchanged on deals for mawae and chrebet bradway said safety sam garnes fractured his left thumb tuesday he will be re evaluated by a hand specialist wednesday his availability will be determined at that point he will not play in friday 's exhibition he will most likely be replaced by nick ferguson receiver santana moss sore hamstrings did no full speed work and rode a bike for part of the time

 dear diary i recently had occasion to visit my sister agnes who had received a book from her grandchildren that posed personal questions on each page with blank spaces on which to write the answers a daughter suggested that each visitor ask one question and record agnes 's answer when the question of sex came up she said i learned a lot by reading romantic novels but nothing graphic when did you learn the facts i asked agnes who has been married 59 years the mother of 13 children who also has countless grandchildren and great grandchildren replied on the job training marge hannan a friend recently visted her daughter who had just begun toilet training her little girl who was almost 2 years old when the need arose and grandma placed her on the potty seat the child said now i need a magazine page kidder september mourn september mourn the passing of the summer the season filled with idle holidaying it 's back to school again a real bummer except for all you parents who are hooraying bob mckenty one day recently my wife and i went to dine at a rather nice restaurant in clifton as we entered the foyer the hostess stepped away from her podium to escort us to our table as she turned before entering the dining room she spotted another patron an elderly woman writing in the reservation book the startled hostess went over to the woman and politely said ma'am what are you doing the woman replied signing the book naturally jim dugan scene the fish counter at shop rite in sterling a woman is standing in front of the fish counter inspecting a large lobster claws and antenna waving being held aloft by an employee in the shopping cart next to her a very small boy is wailing no mommy i do n't want that in my house i do n't want that in my house barbara perry all 's well that ends already no softly blowing sands no brassy outdoor bands no charcoaled sunday cookouts no drives to scenic lookouts no chlorine in my nose no playful garden hose summer slips away hooray bernard jacks i stopped in to see a friend in montclair and found her modeling an elegant new outfit of nautical design where are you going in that babs i asked she answered a sailor friend of ours is launching his new sloop and naming it after his wife but because he 's jewish he ca n't christen it so he 's holding a 'boat mitzvah judith huggins balfe while lounging on the beach in hawaii my wife observed that maui is a bit nicer than our home grown long beach island true i said but it sure is a lot more expensive without missing a beat she answered yes but look what we 're saving on beach tags richard e cleghorn
 it is a relaxing four day four night stay in a small new england city complete with time for reading movies and self reflection management after all wants its guests to stay in bed until noon but there are catches no sunlight no exercise no visitors no minibar although the in room movies are free you can make an occasional phone call but receiving calls is not encouraged and those video cameras pointed at your bed just ignore them any takers the offer is from the sleep lab at wesleyan university 's department of psychology people who sign up will be subjects in two four day visits to the lab and be part of a two year study to analyze how the external environment affects the internal biological clock when completed the research results may help those with irregular sleep cycles mary margaret anderson a 21 year old wesleyan student got ready to take a four day plunge at wesleyan 's judd hall in july am i excited ms anderson asked well i think it 's going to be something different the objective of the study run by namni goel an assistant professor at wesleyan university and financed in part by the national institute of health is simple to measure whether and how sound can affect human circadian rhythms the 24 hour internal body clock normally our internal clock is in sync with the external environment dr goel said but when the two are out of sync as with overnight workers or jet lagged travelers the body clock says sleep the sun says otherwise and nobody 's happy for her study dr goel does her best to remove the variable of the external clock altogether hence the no sunlight rule because the effects of light as a stimulus have been studied dr goel chose another variable sound her subjects spend four nights in the lab and on two of those nights they listen to two hours of stimulus before or after going to bed depending on the study the stimulus is either bird song enhanced with music or sounds imperceptible to the human ear dr goel said it 's supposed to be relaxing so they do n't get bored because they have to listen to it for two hours dr goel said explaining her choice but the stimulus was not nearly as stimulating as one subject mei mei chan had hoped oh my god you have to sit there in this chair and it 's like she paused and stiffened music you just sit there it 's craziness she said laughing ms chan graduated from wesleyan this year and said she figured this would be a good way to fill time and help the university she also received 350 for participating on her first of two visits each subject must participate twice to make the data reliable ms chan watched at least 10 movies in four days the second time around she brushed up on her foreign language skills renting films in german and french and read economics books when she was in high school ms chan said she conducted her own psychology experiment she sent out a questionnaire about the colors people dream but my drawback was i could n't have people in a sleep lab and hook them up to see what color they dreamt in she said so my sophistication was much lower than this but in this experiment subjects enter the lab and the first thing they do after getting settled is have electrodes placed around their heads with an adhesive paste dr goel said the electrodes monitor sleep data every night from brain eeg 's to rapid eye movement to muscle movement in the chin ms chan 's first night was easy she got no stimulus so that her normal sleep patterns could be gauged but sleep on the second two nights was interrupted at 5 45 am with just enough time left for ms chan to don her dark glasses go to the restroom the eyes of the subjects can not be exposed to the light in the bathroom and freshen up before taking her stimulus seat at 6 am using body temperature readings salivary tests for the sleep related hormone melatonin and the sleep data from the electrodes dr goel analyzes the effects of the stimulus on the subsequent nights she found that the effects of sound on sleep are much like those of light a two hour dose of stimulus before bed as in the first study actually pushes the internal clock backward while the same dose after sleep will likely push the clock forward although dr goel is more concerned with the psychological effects than a real world application of her study 's findings her experiment does show that sleep patterns can be altered through sensory stimuli what that may mean is that people who have trouble sleeping could possibly find a nondrug induced way to snooze such as listening to music i know people who 've had problems with sleeping pills said daniel raimi 21 a wesleyan student and a subject for him should a practical application be derived from the experiments all the better i think it would be great for people to have a healthy alternative he said but all of the benefits of science aside being a subject in this type of study is n't exactly easy ms chan said at the end of the four days i just felt like ok this is worse than being a prisoner she said of her first tour you can do anything you want to do but you ca n't see light and there 's only so many movies you can watch when she left the building after her first of two four day sessions ms chan found a new appreciation for freedom but when she left the building after her second four day session her opinion had changed that is because beneath several of the electrodes on her face ms chan developed rashes dr goel said it was probably because ms chan had worn makeup and lotion one day something dr goel had told her not to do ms chan said the rashes were actually worse behind her ears where she applied no makeup she left the study appreciating its goals but lamenting her experience dr goel said that ms chan was the only subject out of more than 75 to develop a rash the subjects all agreed that the nicest part of participating was the isolation it provided the refuge from daily college life and college friends i 'm living with a bunch of students and i think it was good for me to have some time by myself said ms anderson who spent a good deal of her time watching movies as for mr raimi he spent his time practicing guitar but his guitar time and his earlier helping out the sick rationale notwithstanding there was still the cash payment to think of we have jobs but they 're part time and there 's a lot of things we like to do mr raimi said we have to have beer money we have to go to baseball games we have to buy cd 's for unemployed college students with nothing better to do the payment is attractive ms chan concurred but it 's really not attractive for somebody who has something going on in life she said most attractive of all though was leaving mr raimi said that was pretty exciting he said sounding relieved we got to be pretty close with the people administering the study but we were definitely happy to leave

 oleg kvasha the islanders talented yet confounding left wing has had flashes of brilliance before then the flashes end his inner fire seems more like a flickering hearth than a blast furnace kvasha is playing well again for the islanders 20 18 5 2 who wrap up a four game trip sunday at atlanta he has scored four goals in his last six games including an overtime goal thursday in a 3 2 victory over st louis as a result he is playing more it 's nice islanders center aleksei yashin said of kvasha 's play keep your fingers crossed he 's moving well and hopefully he can build some confidence with the way he 's been playing the islanders wary of kvasha 's inconsistencies have learned to temper their praise of him kvasha had one goal and two assists in his first 26 games michael peca the islanders captain said that the team 's coaches had been hard on kvasha and that they had been patient as recently as jan 11 kvasha a 6 foot 5 230 pound russian was on the fourth line which has minimal playing time late in games but kvasha had an assist and scored a late goal with the fourth line against atlanta on saturday and this may have gained him some attention on monday coach peter laviolette put kvasha on the team 's top line yashin 's where kvasha had been expected to spend most of this season kvasha scored again on monday against washington and laviolette said the line was the most productive in an ugly 5 0 loss wednesday to the devils trent hunter the right wing on the line was sent back to bridgeport after the game and laviolette promoted arron asham a rapidly developing 24 year old wing who can skate shoot hard and land a punch the reconfigured line was effective against the blues yashin scored his first goal in seven games asham seemed to track down every loose puck and kvasha knocked the game winning goal past blues goaltender brent johnson 1 minute 59 seconds into overtime he looks like he 's having fun out there laviolette said that may be because kvasha has vowed to keep his game simple on the game winning goal he simply charged to the net and shoved a backhand shot past johnson kvasha figured the closer he got to the net the better his scoring chances laviolette said that 's his strength that 's the vision we have of olie to drive to the net like that hard driven has not been used to describe kvasha whom the islanders acquired with mark parrish on june 24 2000 in the much criticized trade that sent the prized goaltender roberto luongo and center olli jokinen to florida he scored 24 goals in his first two seasons with the islanders but they have come in clusters he ended last season with seven goals in 12 games but he had six goals in the 59 games before that and three were in a five game span kvasha was a healthy scratch in four games last season and three games this season he has been sidelined with knee shoulder and ankle injuries most important he failed to keep a spot on yashin 's line when it was all but handed to him in training camp maybe in the beginning i tried to do too much i tried this and i tried that kvasha said now i am doing one thing at a time islanders fans at nassau coliseum have booed him but when he does well they sing his name to the melody of a soccer chant substituting oleg for ole he loves to hear them cheer and he promises more it probably does not help that when he skates his strides are long nearly effortless which makes it look as if he is not trying he often overskates the puck or loses it without being checked he is also charmingly self deprecating he was asked to re create his goal scoring play thursday and he said with a shrug i 'm not sure i do n't remember what happened there but kvasha knows he needs the work he was one of only six skaters who came to an islanders workout tuesday in syosset ny he knows his roll started with a goal against pittsburgh that he considered one of his luckiest when you have n't scored in a couple of months you just need something to get you going kvasha said there were a lot of things in my mind when i did n't play great i was thinking 'should i do this or should i do that there was something always in my mind now he is just playing but the emphasis as always is on the word now ultimately it 's up to him to play up to his capabilities to play to his potential laviolette said whether i 'm right or wrong i give ice time based on what i see it 's almost like you have to give me a reason to put you out there

 i wonder when americans will get tired of being told what to do and think tina brown wrote in her most recent column for the times of london luckily for ms brown the former editor of talk the new yorker and vanity fair that moment has apparently not arrived yet her new talk show topic a which had its premiere last night on cnbc is all about telling americans what to do and think the british ms brown who in her heyday was as famous as a hostess as she was as a writer and editor seeks tips from her guests in quick bursts of cocktail party chatter a happy hour at the end of cnbc 's long dismal day of stock prices and bulletins from the federal reserve how much juice is there in this trend she asked the media mogul barry diller referring to the influence of the fox news channel on the other cable news networks you mean are we going full right mr diller the chairman and chief executive of usa interactive who might be making a play for the entertainment assets of vivendi universal replied 'god i hope not oxford educated and quick witted ms brown is new to television and her inexperience showed in a breezy off handed way of speaking that at times teetered on the brink of call your congressman poor taste at one point ms brown noted with a smile that when tainted corporations like enron are exposed they vaporize like baghdad buildings the hourlong program which is expected to run only once a quarter represents a fresh start for ms brown a humble return to the new york media world after talk magazine folded in january 2002 her chosen topics for last night 's program suggested that she has not quite gotten over the humiliation she experienced over the first failure of her glittering career she asked mr diller why so many people lost their judgment in the 1990 's was it greed or just social pressure but it was not entirely clear whether she was referring to dot com investors or herself ms brown left the new yorker in 1998 to start a magazine with harvey weinstein the miramax studio co founder so she could as she put it in an interview last year join the entrepreneurial age the premiere party she threw on liberty island for 1400 of the world 's most famous faces madonna henry a kissinger salman rushdie defined the bravado and self indulgence of the decade the guest list for her maiden show last night read a little like a round up of that party in the page six gossip column in the new york post along with mr diller she spoke to conrad black the conservative british newspaper tycoon sir howard stringer chief executive of the sony corporation of america malcolm gladwell the writer simon schama the historian and queen noor of jordan the american born widow of king hussein who has a best selling autobiography leap of faith ms brown was unable to pierce queen noor 's armor of muslim solidarity but did make her squirm a little by asking about her official trips to saddam hussein 's iraq the queen said she had lunch with his wife but did not meet mr hussein himself pairing her guests ms brown posed some amusing questions but at other times the conversation was reminiscent of dinner parties with the high and mighty during which the hostess asks the powerful man to her left a fawning question who is the barry diller of the democratic party and he preens and gives a boring long winded answer that ends with a dodge i like a lot of them in a television talk show world dominated by healers like oprah winfrey and dr phil though ms brown provided a refreshing change of milieu more urbane than suburban jolting the status quo has long been her trademark first at vanity fair and later at the new yorker ms brown brought a frisson of television 's immediacy and glibness to magazine journalism whether she can infect television with a little of the printed word 's reflection and sophistication could be a challenge as she said on the today show yesterday morning in television you have to have kind of a combination of add attention deficit disorder and intense focus all at the same time
 mike shanahan the winning coach in super bowls xxxii and xxxiii has no plans to travel anywhere near super bowl xxxiv his team the denver broncos is the two time defending champion for only six more days either the tennessee titans or the st louis rams will take the broncos throne on sunday night for shanahan this is not a glorious idea or a pretty sight he will watch from denver scouring tapes and his notes on free agency breaking down the draft signing some veteran broncos releasing a few searching for that super mix that can once again plant him in the super game shanahan has been in six super bowls as an assistant coach in denver and san francisco and as the head coach in denver he can give the titans and the rams both wide eyed arrivals at the super bowl plenty to ponder this week the rams have been to the super bowl once in 1980 when they were based in los angeles the titans formerly the houston oilers have never been to the super bowl i 've watched a little about this game and i forgot about the hype involved shanahan said this morning by telephone from his office in denver when you 're coaching in this game you focus but being away from it for the first time in two years i see clearly the huge coverage and hype involved everybody feels good now but by the end only one team can feel that good shanahan continued there have n't been many super bowls when there was only one week to prepare that changes things significantly in the six super bowls i was involved in we had the game plan implemented the week before the game three times and won all three in the three we lost we did it the week of the game both of these teams must have had people last week preparing for this game making sure everything was arranged i wonder about the coaches and the game plans are some coaches going to stay back and arrive late to finish them i would think so only four of the previous 33 super bowls had one week between the conference championship games and the super bowl the last time was in 1994 super bowl xxviii between dallas and buffalo shanahan watched a bit of both conference championship games on sunday and said both the titans and the rams defenses were excelling that is the key ingredient he said to winning the super bowl tennessee has impressed me most because they have won five straight games against teams that have won 11 or more games shanahan said finding ways to win those kinds of games makes you uniquely prepared for the super bowl he wonders about the weather in atlanta this week temperatures are expected to hover near 35 degrees and snow is possible even though the game will be played in the georgia dome practices are scheduled for outdoors he said the setting for the players was also important how you have the team hotel set up for the players is critical shanahan said you want it as normal as possible we had an area set aside for the players that had video games pop and shot basketball pool air hockey and to watch extra game film the players need an outlet for the week on saturday night our players had their own rooms and their families were not allowed you want them the night before the game to be rested and not distracted i think last year the atlanta players had their families with them on saturday night we kept our guys busy up to curfew at 11 15 that night and then alone afterward then the game you try to do everything you 've been doing and not get caught up in the hype shanahan said you ca n't be too conservative you may have a few different plays a couple of different blitzes but you have to guard against overload you ca n't make it where the players are thinking too much instead of performing shanahan said there would be several important facets in the game for the teams are the defenses playing with confidence he said turnovers and ball security pass protect do n't allow cheap scores and make the other team earn it and penalties stay away from first and 20 or second and 20 concentrate during the game and do n't get caught up in the hoopla surrounding you in the stadium concentration is crucial for the young high flying titans and rams he said so often young guys who have n't been to the super bowl get caught up shanahan said i would remind them that this is not an award this is a work week you do n't go to the super bowl to just have fun you go to win the game it does n't matter that you 're there unless you win it i know from experience that if you do n't win the game people within a year will forget you were even there going into it you have to realize that 's simply the way it is and it can happen to you
 for a half the jets had survived hanging close to the buffalo bills and their own slim playoff chances but when the teams came out of the locker room for the third period the bills knew where to attack the jets on the first drive of the second half the bills pounded the ball on the ground they gave the ball to travis henry 9 times and he gained 52 yards 10 more than he had in the first half henry finished the drive by slipping untouched into the end zone from 4 yards out giving the bills a 14 3 lead when the bills got the ball back they put it henry 's hands once again this time 7 times for 46 yards at the end of that drive they settled for a field goal the bills did not stop running until they had a 17 6 victory and henry had a career best 169 yards on 32 carries despite being hampered by a cracked fibula and sore ribs and the jets were once again left to ponder how to stop the run the jets defensive coordinator ted cotrell has a different philosophy than coach herman edwards cotrell made his reputation in buffalo while using a a 3 4 defense edwards has installed a 4 3 defense with the jets but cotrell said sunday that the jets troubles had less to do with strategy than with performance it 's not changing strategy cotrell said what else are you going to do the guys are there and they 're not making the play four weeks ago the oakland raiders started the game against the jets by running the ball 21 consecutive plays the bills rushed for 203 yards including 152 in the second half topping the 202 that dallas accumulated against the jets earlier this season henry became the seventh runner to top 100 yards against the jets and he put up the most yardage by far we had a bunch of missed tackles cotrell said it 's disturbing that you 'd have these missed tackles this time of the year we were hitting guys in the backfield several times we had him stopped for losses and he broke away that was the disturbing thing that 's been the thing all year we 're in position and we do n't finish that 's plagued us the whole year if we just slow the guy down we 'd have a chance that 's what i say 'slow him down if you ca n't do it yourself but that 's the way it 's gone the whole year for the jets the bills knew that and attacked that was a problem of theirs bills coach gregg williams said knowing that coming into the game you want to capitalize on it defensive tackle josh evans was in tears after the game jason ferguson muttered over and over this was one of the worst games i 've played cornerback ray mickens who made several saving tackles along with safety tyrone carter said they were just consistent they just kept on doing it they made a couple of adjustments they just played better than us we gave a 100 percent effort out there i know guys were hitting hitting hard we missed a couple of tackles that we did n't wrap up with but the effort was there the jets limited henry to 53 yards on 18 carries in their 30 3 victory in the third game of the season but it all evaporated even though they had entered the game on a roll and clinging to playoff hopes it 's very frustrating when you take pride in stopping the run and in november and december teams begin to run the ball more linebacker mo lewis said we knew what they were doing but we made mistakes and did not get the job done sam garnes added they ran the ball on us i know the game was n't pretty today it was a long day we knew they were going to run the ball if you ca n't stop the run you ca n't win the game pro football correction december 17 2003 wednesday a sports article on dec 8 about the inability of the jets defense to stop the buffalo bills offense in a 17 6 football loss misspelled the surname of the jets defensive coordinator he is ted cottrell not cotrell
