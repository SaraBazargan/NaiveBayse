anna lindh who died early yesterday at the age of 46 after a stabbing attack was one of sweden 's most popular politicians a lifelong member of the governing social democrats she had been mentioned as a future party leader in 1998 when she became foreign minister under prime minister goran persson the swedish press called her persson 's crown princess seeing her as his likely successor she was vehemently pro european in a country where joining the european union was a heated issue she became the leading campaigner in the government 's drive to persuade a somewhat skeptical electorate to replace the swedish crown with the euro at the time of her death stockholm and indeed much of the country was plastered with posters picturing her under the word ja signifying the yes vote she favored in the referendum set for this weekend ms lindh supported the same causes embraced by swedish social democrats including environmental protection and human rights but she was unusually outspoken earlier this year during sweden 's six month presidency of the european union she called president bush a lone ranger for his decision to go to war in iraq without united nations approval although she expressed support for his campaign against global terror she clashed with the bush administration over other issues as well like its refusal to take part in the formation of the international criminal court she roundly criticized prime minister silvio berlusconi of italy for comparing a german lawmaker to a nazi concentration camp kapo and in an october 2001 interview with the times of india she succinctly laid out her government 's stance on the middle east insisting that israel remove settlements on the west bank withdraw military forces from the west bank and gaza strip anna maria lindh was born in stockholm on june 19 1957 and earned a law degree from the university of uppsala she was elected to parliament in 1982 and quickly rose through her party 's ranks becoming chairman of its youth league in 1984 and a member of the policy making executive committee in 1991 when the social democrats regained power in 1994 she was named environment minister she is survived by her husband bo holmberg also a politician and by their two sons david and filip
 ariel meyerowitz 580 broadway at prince street soho through jan 27 dr harold edgerton 's stop action photographs including the famous milk drop coronet remain enduring icons of modern experience yet why the world of art embraced edgerton 's originally purely scientific work is still a question worth pondering superficially this exhibition 's mostly small black and white vintage prints from 1935 to 1979 are simply informative records of events that happen too quickly for the naked eye to register you can see how all the muscles and tendons of a boxer 's arm stand out at the moment his fist hits the stationary bag you can study hummingbirds an owl or a bat arrested in mid flight as well as a popping balloon that has a wide open gash yet remains tautly inflated pictures that cumulatively record motion preserve the graceful trajectory of an athlete 's golf or squash swing or a pole vaulter 's leap from the perspective of art the appeal of edgerton 's images is in their perfectly composed lucidity and their surrealistic fusion of the factual and the miraculous the milk drop coronet the image of a glowing white crownlike form on a red field seen here in one of just two existing 1957 c prints made from the original negative is an uncannily beautiful image like the motion studies of eadweard muybridge in which the gridded repetition of the human figure suggests a metaphor about the subjection of humanity to technology edgerton 's images have acquired an emblematic aspect they have become symbols of a world in which the real is determined more and more by what machines rather than humans can perceive ken johnson

 directed by kristen coury not rated 87 minutes friends and family an independent feature directed by kristen coury and written by joseph triebwasser tries to crossbreed two popular subgenres of american farce the mafia comedies epitomized by harold ramis 's analyze this 1999 and the long string of gay coming out comedies that probably peaked around the time of mike nichols 's birdcage 1996 but both strains turn out to be too exhausted to reproduce further and friends and family quickly collapses into an overloaded slow moving series of predictable jokes and forced situations greg lauren and christopher gartin are respectively stephen and danny a pair of model handsome gay men who live in a tastefully appointed town house on stuyvesant street in the east village they support their cole porter lifestyle by working improbably as coldblooded enforcers for the mob the film which opens today in new york begins with an unpleasant sequence in which during an intermission at the opera they dash backstage clad in their perfect tuxedos to shake down a tenor who has been late in paying his gambling debts the men come off as little more than well spoken thugs but the moral issues do n't seem to have concerned or even to have occurred to ms coury who finds them endearing a cuddly update of leopold and loeb it 's meant to be hilarious that homosexuals can be as tough as any professional leg breaker and the movie 's central joke is that stephen and danny are much more efficient masters of violence than vito daniel mastrogiorgio and frankie lou carbonneau the two excessively gentle sons of the mafia boss don patrizzi tony lo bianco vito and frankie are n't gay it seems just heavily into cooking and sewing but while stephen and danny are out both to their don and to their parents they have n't told stephen 's midwestern parents beth fowler and frank pellegrino what it is they do for a living this causes complication when stephen 's mom and dad decide to drop in for a surprise visit expecting to find stephen and danny in charge of a successful catering business the surprise visit from the straight world is a staple of this kind of comedy but here instead of pretending to be heterosexuals the two protagonists must assume some ancient mincing gay stereotypes enlisting some of their fellow hit men all traditionally macho beefy brooklyn types to prance around as gay waiters they put on a dinner for their visitors that doubles for reasons best known to the screenwriter as an engagement dinner for the mafia boss 's daughter rebecca creskoff she too has a prospective in law problem her fiance 's parents are a pair of right wing militants tovah feldshuh and brian lane green who see their trip to new york as a chance to initiate a guerrilla war against the federal government with too many characters interacting in too many ways the film feels crowded confused and unproductively frenetic dave kehr

 the united states central command combat surveillance video showed an iraqi military vehicle hiding beneath a bridge a smart bomb glided in from the right destroying the vehicle but leaving the bridge intact then came a surveillance picture of iraqi military communications equipment atop a building within some 2000 year old ruins on the bank of the tigris river a historic site recognized by the united nations in that case american commanders decided not to strike these two targets and the opposite decisions made as to whether to attack illustrate the complicated task given to american war planners who are charged with destroying a government but not a country the military mission calls for coalition forces to topple saddam hussein and rid his nation of any weapons of mass destruction that may be hidden there at the same time the war plan calls for leaving as much iraqi infrastructure as possible standing to ease postwar reconstruction and to minimize civilian deaths in order to quiet angry public opinion as the war enters its second week however military affairs experts ponder whether more indiscriminate bombing might in the end hasten victory and save the lives of american troops and even spare more iraqis the pain of a grinding ground war we decided we would restrain the use of air power for reasons of humanity and world image said loren thompson an air power expert at the lexington institute a policy research center here we have imposed a burden on our campaign plan that may slow down victory and diminish the quality of the victory we achieve american generals can ratchet up the violence delivered by air with just a command mr thompson noted and they are expected to do so as american ground forces move to face republican guard troops encircling baghdad the question is what measure of risk of civilian casualties and damage to buildings like hospitals and schools will be considered acceptable in order to secure a speedier victory this quandary has been placed upon american commanders by mr hussein who has ordered his forces arrayed in neighborhoods even using hospitals as garrisons according to pentagon officials the mantra heard at almost every wartime news conference held by defense secretary donald h rumsfeld or gen tommy r franks the senior commander for the war and his subordinates is that the american military will continue its efforts to exercise extreme prudence in choosing and attacking targets in order to minimize civilian deaths and damage to public works we have a very very deliberate process for targeting brig gen vincent brooks deputy director of operations for the united states central command said during a briefing in qatar today it 's unlike any other targeting process in the world it takes into account all science it takes into account all capability and we do everything physically and scientifically possible to be precise in our targeting and also to minimize secondary effects whether it 's on people or on structures but the second guessing is well under way selective bombing is wrongheaded perpetuating the regime causes more casualties certainly among iraqi troops than 'collateral damage would edward n luttwak a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies wrote in a commentary published by the los angeles times today even as some military experts in the academic world suggest that more intense bombing be considered today kofi annan the united nations secretary general became the latest international leader to serve notice that the united states will suffer far reaching consequences if it starts hitting targets that kill civilians and destroy infrastructure mr annan 's comments came as american officials reacted cautiously to reports that a marketplace in baghdad had been damaged by an explosion that left 14 people dead at the pentagon maj gen stanley mcchrystal said american forces had not aimed any ordnance at that neighborhood in the iraqi capital while officials could not absolutely rule out a hit by an errant american bomb or missile they also said the explosion might have been caused by iraqi antiaircraft fire falling back to earth or a faulty iraqi missile we do know for a fact that something landed in the shaab district general mcchrystal said but we do not know if it was us or iraqi we do know that we did not target anything in the vicinity proponents of air power have argued almost since the invention of the modern warplane that victory can be achieved through the air by attacking enemy leaders communications and the centers of gravity that prop up their governments for this war with iraq the air campaign had been planned to open the offensive and set the stage for the ground attack but that sequence had to be reversed after president bush ordered the surprise missile strike last wednesday in an effort to kill mr hussein and top iraqi leaders general mcchrystal said that since the war began more than 600 cruise missiles and 4300 other precision guided munitions have been launched at iraq but a week into the war air power experts acknowledge that the pentagon 's current bomb and missile campaign failed to deliver a quick knockout blow though that could still happen in recent days the air campaign shifted from mostly planned strikes against leadership targets and command or communications centers to attacks on iraq 's forces in the field specifically the republican guard divisions any analysis of the air campaign by anyone outside the most senior military commands and civilian leadership is naturally based on a hodgepodge of television images scattered witness reports from the front and a sense of history many of the effects of air operations are cumulative said eliot a cohen a professor at johns hopkins university who directed the air force 's definitive study of the first war against iraq at any given time you may think you 're not doing very much but suddenly when the right pressures come together the other guy collapses but he cautioned that the public 's view of the air war is opaque at best
 jimmy fleming has pinpoint vision and short term memory problems his right hand shakes involuntarily he also has a sense of humor and a desire to share his story that story is about his bicycle accident on july 10 1985 mr fleming then 10 years old was out riding with a friend on his way to get some ice cream when he was hit by a car he flew up in the air as high as the telephone wires fell on the windshield and flipped over the back of the car landing on his head mr fleming was in a coma for 16 weeks and was totally blind for two years if he had worn a helmet his head injuries would have been far less severe which is why mr fleming who lives in pleasantville has spent the last five years going to schools boy scout and girl scout meetings and other places where children gather around westchester county promoting helmet safety for bicyclists skateboarders rollerbladers and skiers part lecture part stand up mr fleming 's 20 minute program resembles something you might see on the david letterman show it 's my way of lightening the mood a little said mr fleming who recently took his act to the northern westchester center for the arts where he studies theater quite frankly without a sense of humor my life would have been miserable q you interject jokes into your program have you been criticized for this a no i never make jokes about head injuries or undermine the importance of wearing helmets there 's nothing funny about these things at all i enjoy making people laugh i always have even before the accident my feeling is that if i just stood up and said to the kids you should wear your helmet because it reduces the risk of head injuries by 85 percent or it 's the law they 'd listen and say ok whatever when they hear me talk about my experience they appreciate the fact that i 'm not cynical or bitter and that i have a sense of humor in spite of it all the kids have remarked to me you have such courage and strength i get strength from hearing that q what sort of things do you talk about during your program a at one school i asked the kids to close their eyes for five minutes i asked them to keep them closed and do n't open them when five minutes was up i said now you can open your eyes i asked them what they saw they said nothing i told them that that is what i saw for two years i also tell them to look up at the telephone wires for a minute i say to them that is how high up i was when i was thrown from my bicycle that makes a big impact on them i like to talk about things that scare them then it will mean something q how do you know you 're making an impact on these kids a several years ago i went to the grand union with my dad he said to me jimmy wait right here i 'm waiting for my dad and this kid comes running up to me he told me he was in a bike accident a few weeks ago he said that if he had n't heard my talk he probably would n't have been wearing a helmet he wanted to thank me when i think about my accident i realize there are a few negatives but i also realize there are some positives hearing things like what this boy said are the positives q talk about this talent you have with letters and numbers a i honestly do n't know where that came from it happened after my brain was injured i can identify the letters of the alphabet by their numbers so anytime people tell me their names i see them in their number form i can do this automatically without even thinking about it i do this at the schools and the kids love it q people are constantly saying to you how do you keep your spirits up what do you say to that a my mom said that to me a lot after the accident she said jimmy how do you do it you make it so easy on me i say i just consider the alternative

 as i walked through the local airport last week a baggage handler recognized me and shouted if these two guys ca n't get together and solve this mess neither deserves to be president while his view might not be a realistic solution for the nation the handler was right about the need for the candidates to take control and agree on some sort of process that will bring closure to this election in a very real way the first test of whether al gore or george w bush can be an effective president of the united states is now not the day after the inauguration so far both have allowed their campaign organizations to engage in continuing campaigns to convince the public of the fairness of their positions deploying lawyers spokesmen and campaign managers this way may satisfy the appetite to fight but not the responsibility to reconcile a serious national dilemma no one disputes that this is a unique and challenging moment in our history to have a national election of over 100 million votes come down to a few hundred controversial ballots in florida is without precedent it is understandable that both campaigns having fought long and hard for their candidates want to do whatever it takes to get the very last votes they need to win but while a scorched earth litigation process to the bitter end may make sense to the lawyers and the campaign officials does it make sense for the nation it is obvious that the united states is deeply divided over who should win aggravating those differences in a bitter post election battle will only make it that much more difficult for the winner to govern after the federal court decision not to interfere with florida law both candidates now face a crucial choice they could continue to litigate each election decision that is not acceptable challenging close votes not only throughout florida but in wisconsin iowa new mexico and other states where there are disputed results and continue the battle for votes right up to the electoral college decision in december and perhaps beyond with the supreme court and sheer public exhaustion finally ending the matter or they could come together either in person or through trusted emissaries and agree to a process that would bring this election to closure as fairly and responsibly as possible the choice is theirs since the florida outcome is the deciding factor they could agree for example to allow both sides to hand count those votes that can be challenged under florida law and could establish a deadline perhaps dec 1 for conclusion of that process and complete counting of the absentee ballots the secretary of state for florida could then certify the final results before the electoral college votes both candidates would agree to abide by that final count this kind of agreement between mr gore and mr bush might not satisfy the campaigns or the lawyers or even some of the voters but it would be the right thing for the nation now the candidates are fighting a legal and propaganda war that both are losing more important the nation is losing the presidency is about putting the nation 's interest first having served the president i know the hardest decisions that confront this nation 's leaders are the ones that pit the long term interests of the country against short term political gain deploying troops raising taxes vetoing key legislation or revealing a mistake of judgment may not be very popular but it may be right for the country the legacy of every president rests with how he responds to that choice both of these candidates have campaigned on the basis that they would make the tough choices if and when the time came that time is now leon panetta who was white house chief of staff under president clinton from 1994 to 1997 teaches at california state university at monterey bay
 to the editor as a sept 26 editorial notes democrats are rushing to pass a war resolution that many privately disagree with hoping to avoid having to talk about this issue in the election campaign but the real problem democrats have with voters is that on too many issues they do not act on what everyone knows are their real beliefs it is obvious that many senate democrats think that carrying out the bush tax cuts will produce decades of deficits but none of them will propose eliminating those cuts the effect of condescending to the public on the important questions of the day is that democrats are seen as standing for nothing and give no one a reason to vote for them as long as democrats continue to be paralyzed by political calculation they will neither gain a mandate from voters nor encourage the strong leadership needed to realize their core ideals william s kessler seattle sept 26 2002

 running alongside the gurney that is taking her husband to surgery nancy reagan leans over as she clutches a jar of his favorite candy i brought your jelly beans darling she says every action in the simplistic film the day reagan was shot is so clumsily telegraphed that even the jelly beans eventually get their close up as the fictional nancy waits for word from the operating room she sits alone and watches the career shattering news conference in which secretary of state alexander m haig jr announces in a voice so quavering it could only inspire fear i am in control here at the white house she is so appalled she literally spills the beans and the camera focuses on brightly colored candies scattering on the floor around her black pumps that might have been a nice comic touch if the film were a satire but it 's not despite some halfhearted attempts at wit the day reagan was shot is an earnest look at what happened when john w hinckley jr tried to assassinate ronald reagan in march 1981 and if the jelly bean close up seems an odd choice an even stranger decision surrounds the movie why would showtime sandwich this limp re creation between two documentaries about the events the nonfiction programs only highlight the film 's lack of drama and the entire package suggests how difficult it is for a fictional version of recent history to stand beside events that have already been captured by news cameras replayed for years and beaten flat in memoirs recreating history is not the problem here oliver stone an executive producer of this film has built a career on it he was more effective in nixon than in j f k but whatever you think of his interpretations he knows how to use the freedom that fiction offers creating gripping movies and provoking ideas cyrus nowrasteh who wrote and directed the day reagan was shot sticks close to the facts but does n't share mr stone 's creative flair the assassination attempt is recreated in a quick cut style that mimics the jittery news film without capturing its shocking effect but the story 's focus is on the chaotic aftermath and richard dreyfuss deserves his top billing as haig all the president 's men bumble the running of the country secure phone lines do n't work they squabble about whether the level of military readiness has officially been heightened but haig makes a major grab for power and even mistakenly tells the public he is next in line for the presidency after the vice president taking his cue from the heavy handed script mr dreyfuss has a mad dog demeanor from the start much of the film takes place in the white house situation room as other cabinet members and advisers try to calm the rabid haig the rational dignified secretary of defense caspar w weinberger is played by the always superb colm feore thirty two short films about glenn gould with an understated realism that stands out among much scenery chewing next to the pointed dialogue that zooms around the situation room on the west wing these re creations are cartoonish meanwhile the president 's advisers at the hospital including the deputy chief of staff michael k deaver michael murphy effectively manage the news mr reagan was much closer to death than the public knew but today that is not surprising to anyone informed about the events and the story is not presented dramatically enough to grab anyone who is n't richard crenna does n't try to impersonate reagan beyond a tilt of the head all he has to do is be there and mouth a few familiar lines honey i forgot to duck he tells holland taylor who plays nancy straightforwardly as the fiercely devoted wife the day reagan was shot is more interesting for the way it plays next to the documentaries in bulletproof which precedes it mr deaver describes how the president insisted on walking from his car into the hospital when he hit the door frame his knees went out from under him he says it was as if the curtain was there and he had performed when we got to the curtain he gave out the film 's reagan insists on walking too but while he wobbles a bit he never buckles making it all the way to the trauma room on his own in these interpretations the nonfiction reagan is a consummate actor and the fictional reagan just that strong a guy at reagan 's side which follows the movie includes snippets of an audiotape of the situation room conversation made by richard v allen the national security adviser in interviews mr allen and mr weinberger reinforce some portrayals and suggest that their resentment of mr haig 's behavior has persisted through the years but mr allen also says that mr haig was never in charge of anything that day everyone agrees that one person not in charge was the president mr nowrasteh who wrote the pilot for the television series la femme nikita has said i 've really come to respect president reagan and nancy reagan enormously and i hope the movie shows that you have to assume it 's inadvertent then that this muddled film reinforces the image of ronald reagan as the president in the empty suit 'hell in the pacific the learning channel tonight at 9 facts alone are not always enough to carry a documentary but the graphic news film and photographs in this program about world war ii combat in the pacific are amazing on their own presented today to commemorate the bombing of pearl harbor the program includes interviews with allied and japanese soldiers as well as combat film that deserves its advisory stating the images may disturb some viewers the documentary does not clean up the americans ethnic slurs and blunt desire to kill japanese and does not shy away from photographs of japanese atrocities one chinese woman has a chunk missing from the back of her neck where the japanese tried to behead her hell in the pacific is not artistically made but it is enormously valuable as an addition to better known images of nazi atrocities and as a counterpoint to greatest generation

 ralph nader was on a tear railing against chief executives salaries the corporate dominated campaign finance system and cuts in factory inspections several of the steelworkers seated around him were nodding and then nodding again in silent approval for a few minutes at least on friday it seemed as if the steelworkers cynicism about politics and politicians had evaporated and they were receiving the truth or at least a truth they rarely hear you 're the guys who work hard said mr nader the green party candidate for president you 're the guys who pay the taxes you 're the guys who fight the wars and then they say 'tough we 're closing the factory it 's globalization and then they use factories overseas where dictators repress the wages to compete against you mr nader whose words though not his speaking style are laced with emotion then laid into vice president al gore and other democrats saying they have done little for labor because they have been able to take labor 's support for granted when you 're taken for granted you 're taken he said when organized labor can say to these candidates 'you 're not going to take us for granted anymore we have an alternative and the alternative is nader and the green party then they 'll start calling afterward the 20 steelworkers who had gathered in a small ohio state university classroom to hear mr nader gave him rave reviews and many of them vowed to vote for him this november mr nader was in columbus for rallies with green party members environmentalists and steelworkers i 'd say nader is the best of anyone said david cole an electrician at ak steel 's mill in mansfield ohio i really like him i have n't seen much from anyone else his friend and co worker larry pugh was just as enthusiastic i think he has the right answers said mr pugh a crane operator at the plant where management locked out 620 workers last september he gives us a choice because the democrats and republicans have sold us down the river this outpouring of enthusiasm for mr nader worries many democrats who fear that so many steelworkers auto workers teamsters and other union members will vote for him this fall that mr gore could lose in ohio and other midwestern swing states for the democrats an added concern is that two of the most powerful unions in the midwest the teamsters and the united auto workers have flirted with mr nader and have not endorsed mr gore even though the afl cio is backing the vice president many steelworkers are still angry at mr gore because he backed the agreement to normalize trade relations with china which many union members fear will accelerate the exodus of american factories to china although mr nader is best known for his crusading on consumer protection and the environment he has grown closer to labor unions in recent years fighting with them against the china trade deal the world trade organization and the north american free trade agreement all the steelworkers here hailed mr nader but several said they would still vote for mr gore because they feared gov george w bush would win if mr nader drained too many votes from the vice president i 'd like to thank you for championing our issues skip hall another a steelworker who drove in from mansfield told mr nader you 're terrifying the democrats you know this is going to be a very close election in 1980 i was dissatisfied with jimmy carter i backed ted kennedy and we ended up with ronald reagan he gave us a bad supreme court we 're still living with that today that 's the dilemma we face today the same thing could happen with you the excitement generated by mr nader also concerns some labor leaders john j sweeney the afl cio 's president has repeatedly urged union members to back mr gore saying it is important to prevent mr bush from winning because working with a republican congress he might push through legislation to weaken unions and job safety laws george becker president of the united steelworkers of america was one of labor 's most vociferous critics of the china deal but he says it is time to line up behind mr gore he said in an interview that labor 's support for mr nader was modest and would grow smaller and he predicted that many union members leaning toward mr nader would ultimately vote for mr gore upon realizing that mr nader can not win there are two viable candidates al gore and george w bush and we 're picking the one closest to the viewpoints of our members and the issues of working people mr becker said nader 's a fine man he takes a lot of positions that are near and dear to us but he is not a viable candidate in that regard anybody who would support ralph nader we think would lessen al gore 's chances of winning david leland chairman of the ohio democratic party said that the race between mr gore and mr bush was close in his state but that he did not think mr nader would hurt the vice president recent polls show mr nader getting 4 percent of the vote in ohio compared with more than 10 percent in california but mr leland said those were high water marks that were bound to fall most people know a vote for ralph nader is a wasted vote at best and a vote for george bush at worst he said mr becker said he hoped mr gore would become more outspoken on workers issues to excite union members about his candidacy indeed on monday mr gore is scheduled to hold a town hall meeting in cleveland with 75 steelworkers from ohio pennsylvania indiana and illinois the nader campaign sees this as a move to keep union members from drifting toward their candidate mr nader said a central purpose of his candidacy was to move the democratic party left on labor and other issues to make it easier for unions to organize mr nader called for making it legal for a union to boycott not just the company it is striking against but other companies that do business with it such boycotts were banned by the taft hartley act in 1947 he also called for requiring employers to pay triple damages when they illegally fire workers for supporting a union asserting that he should be included in any presidential debates mr nader said he would seek to force mr gore and mr bush to address work related issues like occupational safety that have been largely ignored during the campaign gore will tell you 'i 'm for you i 'm going to fight for you i 'm for a ban on using replacement workers in strikes mr nader said but what has he done in eight years i do n't care what you 're for i want to know what you 've done talk is cheap
 how about forcing the iraqi people to take out a mortgage on their newfound freedom using their nation 's future oil revenue as collateral a proposal to do that making a loan out of the 20 billion the bush administration is seeking to cover the first round of reconstruction costs is gaining support in congress of all the bad ideas that have been floated recently about iraq 's future this is one of the worst it is understandable that lawmakers from both parties are suffering sticker shock over president bush 's request for an additional 87 billion for postwar iraq and afghanistan the estimated costs of occupying and rebuilding iraq are skyrocketing while projections for foreign contributions and potential iraqi oil income keep shrinking but adding 20 billion to iraq 's current foreign debt is not the answer iraq already owes tens of billions to france russia and others much of which may have to be written off preferentially guaranteeing iraq 's debt to the united states for funds paid out to american contractors with future oil revenue would only reinforce suspicions around the world about our motives for going to war nor is it sensible economically baghdad may earn only about 10 billion from its oil sales next year and while iraq stands to make more than that in the longer term it is hard to see how the struggling country would be able to repay a 20 billion loan from washington the white house is scrambling to oppose the loan idea but its refusal to level with the american people over the past year about the true costs of the war and its aftermath only fed the notion that no great sacrifices lay ahead its vague talk about oil money 's covering much of the tab did little to prepare congress for the day of reckoning the 20 billion for reconstruction the administration is seeking is a down payment on an investment that could add up to 100 billion in coming years congressional demands for more specifics about how this money will be spent are appropriate but efforts to separate this request from the less controversial 65 billion for military operations are counterproductive lawmakers who overwhelmingly supported this war should face the responsibility for helping to build a stable and functional iraq eventually able to stand on its own right now building new roads and power plants in iraq is as essential to our national interest as paying for the training salaries and equipment of the men and women in the military forces in iraq the alternative moving to make the task just a bit cheaper by saddling the iraqi people with even more foreign debt is a recipe for fomenting resentful anti americanism it sounds more like a punitive versailles style approach to the vanquished instead of the marshall plan for the middle east that the white house keeps promising
 taiwan won formal clearance today to join the world trade organization one day after china received clearance admission of both is expected by the end of this year or early 2002 the terms for admitting taiwan were hammered out almost two years ago but acceptance of a pact was postponed because of a 1992 understanding that beijing would be the first to enter on monday the 142 country members of the trade group gave their approval to china 's membership clearing the way for china to join the open market trading system china which regards taiwan as a breakaway province agreed not to block its joining the condition for chinese taipei as it is officially called by the wto is that entry comes after china 's admission hong kong and macao also part of china have already become members of the trade organization under the separate category of customs territories not countries although taiwan 's entry conditions and commitments were set out in 1200 pages of text longer than the 1000 page document china agreed to it wrapped up its membership in less time than did china beijing pursued membership for 15 years of on and off talks taiwan began negotiating 12 years ago the way is now clear for china and taiwan to receive formal approval for membership at a meeting of trade ministers in doha qatar in november the pacts are subject to the approval of both parliaments if the agreements are ratified there is a 30 day waiting period before the memberships become official although membership requires that members trade with each other on equal terms it does not necessarily mean more trading taiwan currently bars direct trade with china once we become a member of the wto we will be making a decision on our economic and other relations with china said steve chen a negotiator for taiwan we do believe the wto could serve as a very good channel for us to talk to mainland china
 to the editor the discussion of the economic effects of new york city 's tough regulation banning smoking in bars and restaurants is by no means complete front page dec 28 bartenders and other workers who are no longer compelled to inhale other people 's smoke will most certainly have health benefits some smokers may take the change in regulations as an opportunity to quit smoking and some people who had traditionally avoided bars because of the smoke might come in for a drink the net benefit to the health status productivity and reduced health care costs accrues to individuals and the community not just the owners the question should not be about the economic impact of the smoking ban on bars and restaurants but about the overall economic impact of this important public health initiative edward anselm md new york dec 28 2003
 with members of the best team in school history in attendance the city college men 's basketball team finished the most improbable run in city university of new york athletic conference history defeating staten island 77 69 last night at the nat holman gymnasium on the city college campus becoming the first no 8 seeded team to win the conference tournament the beavers 14 14 captured their first conference title since 1980 and advanced to the division iii ncaa tournament in any sport you want to gel right before you enter the playoffs said ccny coach andy stampfel whose beavers had lost six in a row before winning four straight this week we came together at the right time staten island 18 9 took a 15 7 lead on a layup by david paul the conference player of the year midway through the first half but ccny responded with a 10 2 run and led at the half 29 28 on obinna efobi 's 3 point play the beavers never trailed in the second half building a 9 point lead a layup by paul cut the lead to 6 with eight minutes left but consecutive 3 pointers by jason knock and aki trent boosted the lead back to 12 and the beavers hung on efobi a freshman was the game 's leading scorer with 19 points while the senior ralph perez contributed 15 and was named the tournament 's most valuable player i kept telling our players that we were n't really an eight seed and asked them to believe stampfel said i 'm so happy for them at halftime the conference honored the surviving members of ccny 's 1949 50 nit and ncaa championship teams floyd layne ed warner and leroy watkins attended in the women 's final the senior courtney aimetti had 21 points and 23 rebounds as the staten island dolphins topped hunter college to win their second consecutive cuny athletic conference title 83 70 winning last year was great but this one is much better said aimetti who was named the tournament 's most valuable player we have a very young team and i thought that that might hinder us despite dominating the glass and dictating the tempo in the first half the dolphins 20 8 led by only 4 points at halftime and that lead was quickly erased by the top seeded hawks 18 9 who took their first lead on a jumper by bridget evers five minutes into the second half but the dolphins stormed back behind aimetti and forward keisha cook who scored all 19 of her points in the second half this was the fourth straight year that staten island and hunter have met in the tournament final the hawks won in 1998 and 1999 while the dolphins have won the past two
 the united nations oil for food program in iraq has little prospect of releasing even 1 billion of its approximately 14 billion for emergency food and medical aid before its authorization runs out on may 12 the program 's director said in an interview today and while benon sevan director of the office of iraq program hopes to persuade the security council to extend the program 's emergency authorization until june 3 he said its complexities and the political debates whirling around it made it unlikely that its outlays would reach 10 percent of the funds available even with the time extension the program 's future has been in limbo since last week when president bush called for an end to united nations sanctions against iraq because the oil for food program was created to ease the burden of sanctions on ordinary iraqis ending the sanctions effectively means ending the program that controls most of the iraqi economy the iraqi government did the contracting for the program offering billions of dollars worth of business to companies from countries with which it wanted to trade in the seven years since the program began one security council diplomat said today russian companies did twice as much business as any other country 's firms 73 billion in oil purchases and the sale of other goods since 1996 other leading trading partners were egypt at 43 billion and france at 37 billion jordan the united arab emirates and china each did more than 3 billion in business through the program the diplomat said the idea of cutting off the russian and french contracts has wide appeal in republican circles in washington where those countries opposition to the war is remembered bitterly but little has been said about the implications of doing the same to egypt and jordan two of the countries the united states has worked most closely with in the middle east in an interview today mr sevan turned away all questions about specific countries and specific contracts i do n't look at contracts in terms of countries of origin he said i look at the contracts in terms of what is required he added if we start going to a determination if something is good or bad by country of origin we are playing politics and i do n't want to be part of it part of the delay in expediting emergency food and medical supplies to iraq mr sevan said stemmed from 10 days of procedural haggling among security council representatives on the program 's oversight committee more time was taken determining what aid was already on its way and what would be needed as i said yesterday mr sevan said my hands are tied and my legs are tied and i 'm being asked to serve a seven course dinner that 's the problem to unravel the web of contracts approved by a security council committee that included representatives from the united states and the united kingdom could take months mr sevan indicated currently the escrow account for the program contains 103 billion earmarked for goods like health related equipment 437 million electrical equipment 13 billion water and sanitation equipment 513 million and spare parts for oil production 2 billion an additional 6 billion of contracts have been approved but until the oil starts flowing again no revenue will come in to pay for them and it is unclear who will be in charge of the oil sales when they resume even the 85 million barrels of iraqi oil at the turkish port of ceyhan can not be sold mr sevan said because there is no legally sanctioned owner to sell it mr sevan is to discuss these issues at a closed security council session on tuesday afternoon he will appear a few hours after hans blix a chief weapons inspector talks to the council about his group 's readiness to return to iraq the debate over what role the united nations will play in the new iraq has brought the oil for food program into prominence it has also revived longstanding criticisms over items like its administrative budget paid for from a 22 percent share of all the oil sold under the program which has totaled more than 1 billion under united nations supervision designed to keep iraq from importing the raw materials for unconventional weapons iraq 's former government sold up to 22 million barrels of oil daily and purchased goods ranging from electrical generators to spare parts for oil field equipment to the basic food rations for 60 percent of the iraqi populace
 the church of st ann and the holy trinity which has been closed for seven months recently announced that it was preparing to reopen but while the 154 year old national historic landmark on montague street has long been covered in scaffolding it has also been mired in dissent and church officials do not agree on whether it is safe to open at all in december the church 's insurance company urged that it undergo structural repairs and the rev peter golden archdeacon for brooklyn churches in the episcopal diocese of long island proclaimed it in terrible structural shape the vestry of st ann 's voted to close the church temporarily since then the parish has worshiped at christ church and the holy family in cobble hill claudia barber a church warden said that asbestos had been removed and that although reports of structural problems had been one of the reasons that were represented for the closing an engineer had found no serious structural problems the church simply needs restoration ms barber said including work on the brownstone facade and on one or two windows that have n't been finished although no date had been set for the reopening she said it would take place as soon as the church which has a new vestry could move its belongings from cobble hill but mr golden said that according to city engineers it would take millions to correct the damage which he said included an unstable roof tower and floor insofar as them going back i know nothing of it he said adding that final word on whether to reopen would come from the bishop i as the archdeacon would feel very uncomfortable sending a priest to a facility that has been deemed by experts to be unsafe he added that he saw an emotional factor at work there are certain people who want to keep it open for its contribution to the cultural life of the community he said if the roof falls in the cultural life of the community will go out the door ilyse fink a spokeswoman for the buildings department said that in october an inspection had found cracks and defective masonry in the exterior walls she said that while the damage did not warrant forcing the building to close inspectors issued a notice of violation in december the city fined the church 800 for failing to maintain the building the church has had other troubles last summer the st ann center for restoration and the arts a secular group that had used the church as a performance space for 21 years and raised more than 4 million for its restorations left amid charges that the church had threatened to curtail the group 's independence the church may look for a new tenant tara bahrampour
 marion berry a democratic representative from arkansas has raised congressional arrogance to a new level gripped by ideological fury in june mr berry added a provision to the agricultural spending bill stripping funds from the office of james lyons an under secretary of agriculture who oversees the forest service and the natural resources conservation service mr lyons 's republican critics later modified the amendment so that it left the funding intact but stripped him of his authority to run the agencies either way it was clear that mr lyons had been singled out for special abuse and that mr berry had started the crusade what had mr lyons done to deserve this according to mr berry himself the under secretary 's main sin was to side with the environmental protection agency when it decided to enforce a long dormant provision of the clean water act to get a better grip on polluted runoff from so called non point sources like farms city streets and golf courses mr lyons helped the epa establish a timetable that would enable farmers to comply with the law on a reasonable schedule but he never challenged the agency 's authority to enforce the law as some agricultural lobbyists had hoped he would nor was he in mr berry 's view sufficiently pro farmer in his negotiations a conservationist mr lyons has angered members of congress before not least for his support of president clinton 's plan to put millions of acres of the national forests off limits to new roads as well as his efforts to enlarge protections for alaska 's tongass national forest but nobody had gone so far as to undermine his job the white house already worn out from its efforts to block anti environmental riders in other bills is unlikely to fight this one in part because it will have no serious effect on the two agencies or even on mr lyons himself the provision expires jan 20 when mr lyons will leave washington to teach at yale but it is still a petty gesture that brings no honor on mr berry or the other congressmen who have willingly gone along with his vendetta
 allen iverson rocked to a rhythm only he could feel tonight stopping and popping fading away to find twine slashing with brash assurance and finishing with soft finger rolls iverson the smallest player on the court at 6 feet tall created an electrical storm every time he touched the ball and then with 159 seconds remaining in game 2 of the eastern conference semifinal series against the toronto raptors iverson the philadelphia 76ers all star guard turned to the first union fans between free throws he cupped his ear to challenge them to yell louder opened his mouth wide flung back his head and roared exhaling the energy that propelled him to his stunning 54 point performance iverson went back to the foul line and added his final point of the night his team 's 19th in a row as the sixers went on to finish off the raptors 97 92 and even the series heading back to toronto at one game apiece tonight it was just a great player having an incredible night sixers coach larry brown said shaking his head it was a pretty inspiring performance in the sixers game 1 defeat iverson hit only 11 of his 34 shots and scored 36 points and he was determined tonight to improve on that he made 21 of 39 shots piling 20 points into the second quarter and 19 of the sixers final 20 points in the fourth his 54 points were a team playoff high and tied the career high he set this season on jan 6 against cleveland when he was taken out of the game for the first time there were only 14 seconds left that 's something you expect every night especially of me iverson said matter of factly last game i took what they gave me they gave me wide open jumpers i took a lot of quick shots and guys were n't in rebounding position i had a lot of time to think about it because i could n't sleep after that first loss i said 'rather than what they give me i 'm not going to look at it like that i will take everything i want do n't settle for anything iverson settled for nothing less than spectacular taking advantage of the raptors surprising lack of a double team i feel like the only player who can stop me is myself he said in the process he left his teammates stunned how many guys are you going to see come into a playoff game and just dominate at 6 feet just doing what you want out on the floor aaron mckie said it 's a beautiful thing it just comes at such a spectacular time with the playoffs an intense atmosphere and everyone chanting 'mvp i 'm lost for words just watching his performance he carried us the whole game eric snow was the only other sixer to score in double figures with 10 points it did not matter toronto 's superstar vince carter scored 28 points but only 4 in the crucial final period which the raptors entered trailing by 2 73 71 when you see those two kids it 's hard to believe the game is in trouble brown said but adding of iverson we just rode the great horse tonight it does n't get much better than that performance with nine minutes remaining and the sixers ahead by just 77 75 iverson scored his team 's next 19 points the teams were tied 80 80 with 7 minutes 50 seconds to play when iverson hit a 3 pointer the sixers would never relinquish their lead he followed with a 12 foot runner a driving finger roll another cool jumper iverson had brought his team back from a 14 point deficit with 10 10 to play in the second quarter with the seconds waning in the first half he rocked from left foot to right conducting a crossover dribble clinic letting toronto 's chris childs watch him like a cat peering up at a dangling ball of yarn iverson at the last second let go a 22 foot jumper and it shimmied down the net as the buzzer sounded finding the perfect groove the sixers led at halftime 49 47 and answered toronto 's rallies each time in the second half the raptors never changed their strategy on iverson we considered it raptors coach lenny wilkens said of a double team a couple of times we wanted to turn him into a double team area but we did n't do it iverson knew with the sixers trailing in the series and trailing early at home that he had to drive the lane and make the open shots you expect to play well every night he said the only thing you care about is getting the win
 i do n't know that i will ever receive a formal letter of rejection from the coral gables garden club i know of the rejection only because one of my sponsors for membership told me the reason had nothing to do with the quality of my flower arrangements nor did it stem from my spotty record as a tropical gardener i am a pretty good northern gardener but the tropics have stumped me more than once the reason offered to my sponsor for my rejection was that i was too liberal the club members have a point i spoke out against the war in iraq and i 've been arrested for protesting against other wars and marching for abortion rights and racial justice with this rejection i thus join tim robbins in this strange season he was disinvited to a baseball hall of fame event on similar grounds i join susan sarandon who was disinvited by the united way of tampa bay for antiwar comments i join the poets who were disinvited to the white house because they might have embarrassed the president at least i am in good company being blackballed by the green thumb crowd blue haired or otherwise is a sobering experience but i can change if a dyed in the wool zone 5 gardener can toss away her forcing forsythia picking up her roots and replanting them in the land of the bougainvillea then surely the garden club can consider me again in hopes of having another chance at membership i have thought of renaming my french string beans which are miraculously giving a daily crop perhaps henceforth they should be called liberty beans same for the french lettuces there is really no need to give the lettuce a nationality we can just call it lettuce and leave it at that i could bathe my night blooming jasmine in red white and blue lights and put bunting around the orange jasmine the dozens of bromeliads in my front yard could be a problem they all have spikes of pink flowers might the garden club think shades of joe mccarthy that i am a pinko i am writing a third garden book to spruce up my credentials did i mention that when i first came to town the club featured me as a speaker when i finished speaking the audience clapped in the question and answer session no one asked about politics many people bought the books perhaps they found evidence of my politics in the pages was there something suspicious about the way i mulch are my rock decorations a threat to homeland security perhaps i should write a new book called politically correct gardening in it i could show the single right way to plant hoe seed and compost i would focus on native plants or ones that originated in countries among america 's coalition of the willing i would avoid pink flowers altogether nothing french would be mentioned all plants would have to look good in bunting gardening is my hobby i wanted to join the club because its members know stuff i want to know i 'm not going to get in but i have learned something in the process a good gardener even a liberal one ca n't take this sort of rejection on her gardening kneepad she takes off her gloves puts down her shears and stands up donna schaper senior pastor of the coral gables congregational church is author of the art of spiritual rock gardening

 many people dream about opening their own restaurant in the most common rendition of this fantasy the restaurant is a small place more like a living room with just a few special things on the menu that change according to whim dinner is like a night with friends after a few escapist minutes this fantasy usually passes but not always as in the case of a a tiny place where the kitchen table as restaurant comes to life actually a is more of a lounge than a restaurant with several mismatched formica topped kitchen tables and room for 15 or so any more and the chef marc solomon who owns a with his fiancee blue grant would n't be able to enjoy the fantasy though the menu offers only six dishes at a time mr solomon barely keeps up from his station behind a counter with only a toaster oven and two single burners nonetheless he and ms grant have turned a into an extension of their home greeting everyone who comes through the door a surprising number of whom know mr solomon from past incarnations downtown where he ran a restaurant les deux lapins and a bar red strype a sweet 60 's vibe pervades the premises and when it 's time to leave hugs and kisses abound even if you 're a newcomer as mr solomon says when you 've got only 200 square feet you 've got to love everybody they 've wisely disencumbered themselves of distractions a place to wait there 's a bench outside a wine list bring your own the host appreciates a taste just be sure it 's something you wo n't mind sipping from a drinking glass that leaves mr solomon 's tiny menu the sort of inspired amateur cooking that would make him the best loved member of a college commune 's kitchen broiled snails 8 a half dozen or more are stuffed inside two big conch shells in a bath of oil herbs and plenty of garlic they make a perfect appetizer for a main course of curried lamb pie 10 a delicious caribbean inspired dish of ground lamb in a crisp pastry shell moistened with a thin layer of coconut creme fraiche and crowned with tossed greens those are by far the two best dishes a notch below are a rustic chunky rabbit pate 9 served with figs olives and cornichons and an equally nice hors d'oeuvre a roasted pear stuffed with goat cheese 9 trailing the pack are a vegetarian crepe 10 stuffed with ackee a bland caribbean fruit and calaloo a spinachlike leaf which is too dry despite a mango salsa warmed camembert 8 topped with grapes and grape tomatoes is a runny failure to me but seems nonetheless popular judging by how the room is continually perfumed by melting cheese there are two desserts 6 each that are quite good made by a friend of mr solomon 's one is a dense chocolate and coffee cheesecake that actually tastes like fine espresso while the other is a subtle peach and mango cake you might wonder why mr solomon and ms grant call their restaurant a the restaurant takes its logo from the a train and the dining room is decorated with subway maps which may seem curious since the a stops nowhere nearby maybe in their fantasy all trains lead to a a 947 columbus avenue near 106th street manhattan 212 531 1643 best dishes broiled snails in garlic sauce curried lamb pie rabbit pate roasted pear with goat cheese chocolate coffee cheesecake peach mango cake price range savory dishes 8 to 10 desserts 6 credit cards cash only hours lunch thursday and friday 11 30 am to 4 pm dinner tuesday through saturday 6 to 10 pm brunch saturday and sunday noon to 5 pm wheelchair access tightly packed tables narrow entrance to restroom

 once again kenyans have found themselves caught in the middle of a war that is not their own television images broadcast throughout kenya today showed the charred remains of a building brought down by a bomb a frantic search and rescue effort and victims carried away to hospitals and the morgue the attack on the paradise hotel in the coastal resort city of mombasa was eerily reminiscent of the even deadlier attack four years ago on the united states embassy in the capital nairobi in both cases innocent kenyans made up the bulk of the casualties in both cases as well it appeared that kenya was the venue but that the driving force was international politics that had little to do with east africa mombasa is home to most of kenya 's muslims who generally mix easily with the majority christians especially when the situation there is compared with that of kenya 's strife ridden neighbor sudan as well as a beach paradise the city is a bustling port linking kenya to the middle east mombasa 's islamic culture is strong with some streets emptying out at prayer time and islamic dress commonplace just as in nigeria muslims in mombasa spoke out against the miss world pageant calling on miss kenya not to take part but after issuing their statement mombasa 's muslims largely stayed quiet the latest bombing aimed at israelis is sure to increase calls among some kenyans for their country one of america 's staunchest military allies in africa to distance itself from the policies of washington after the sept 11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon last year president daniel arap moi of kenya whom the united states has criticized for his autocratic ways but embraced for his consistent backing of american policies marched down the street in a show of support the gesture was intended to counter muslim protests in nairobi in which the united states was denounced as evil when muslims marched in the direction of the israeli embassy in nairobi mr moi dispatched security forces to break up the demonstrations and stationed full time soldiers at the embassy 's front gate the relationship between the united states and kenya especially when it comes to military matters is close the american military operated from kenya during the 1991 persian gulf war and again during the ill fated relief mission in somalia in 1994 german and british surveillance planes supporting the united states led campaign against terrorism are currently using mombasa as a base as they search the seas off somalia for any fleeing qaeda operatives islamic leaders based along kenya 's coast have spoken out publicly against such operations as have some victims of the embassy bombing in 1998 which killed 12 americans and 247 kenyans ambassador johnnie carson and others in the american embassy in kenya have worked in recent months to soothe tensions between the united states and kenya 's large muslim population american diplomats have shown up regularly at cultural festivals and sponsored town meetings in recent months the united states has also provided money to train kenya 's airport workers in security screening and to upgrade equipment at airports the united states has also spent millions of dollars rebuilding structures in nairobi that were damaged in the 1998 embassy blast and paid medical bills for wounded kenyans and school fees for victims families but the compensation given to kenyans was nowhere near as generous as that offered by congress to the families of the americans who died in the sept 11 attacks in the united states and lawsuits have been filed by kenyans to gain more assistance only if americans are superior victims can the disparity explained paul wala chairman of a survivors association said at a recent news conference i was just walking down the street and america 's foreign policies caused me to get knocked down and hurt another victim said recently i had nothing to do with it with today 's attack at mombasa more kenyans have fallen victim in a global war in which they were not fighting

 complaints that the rev robert v gale was molesting young boys first reached the attention of the roman catholic archdiocese of boston in 1979 there were more reports and concerns raised about sexual abuse in 1981 1983 and 1987 but according to documents released today which described the complaints it was not until 1991 that the archdiocese removed father gale from parish ministry then father gale was allowed to live at another church where in 1994 more accusations were made the documents are part of 252 pages of church records concerning five priests who have been accused of sexual abuse the papers were released today by lawyers for some 250 people who say they were abused by priests in many cases the complaints were handled by some of the highest ranking archdiocesan officials including bishop thomas v daily who now heads the brooklyn diocese the rev john b mccormack who is now bishop of new hampshire and bishop robert j banks who is now bishop of green bay wis in 1981 the rev george rosencranz was arrested after a security guard in a sears roebuck store discovered him performing sexual acts with a young man in a restroom stall according to a memorandum written by bishop daily bishop daily wrote that father rosencranz denied the accusations and expressed concern to me about his effectiveness at the parish if people know or heard of allegation etc i told him in light of his protestation of innocence i would support him bishop daily also wrote that we ca n't contact the news media and added that priests are vulnerable father rosencranz was allowed to return to his parish and the charges against him were dismissed the notes from bishop daily suggest that the police might not have charged father rosencranz if they had known he was a priest in 1987 the archdiocese received another complaint from a former parishioner who accused father rosencranz of making sexual advances 18 years earlier he was briefly sent for treatment but later bishop banks wrote that the church had determined there is no reason to pursue this matter any further because the person making the charge was unable to provide any corroborating evidence in 1989 father rosencranz was arrested in a state park in north andover mass charged with indecent assault after he tried to touch the crotch of an undercover police officer after the arrest father rosencranz was placed on sick leave the archdiocese 's way of quietly removing him from ministry donna m morrisey a spokeswoman for the boston archdiocese said she could not comment on the cases because they were in litigation calls to a spokesman for bishop daily were not returned spokesmen for bishop banks and bishop mccormack cited the difficulties of commenting on personnel documents they had not seen in a statement bishop banks added i can only say that i always tried to deal fairly with both the priests and those alleging abuse in 1979 bishop daily was told that father gale a pastor at st joseph 's church in quincy molested two boys and father gale admitted to one accusation bishop daily told that the parents were ready to take their cases to prosecutors removed him from st joseph 's but father gale was transferred to another parish st jude in waltham and allowed to supervise altar boys three of whom complained in 1981 including one boy who said the priest had put his hand down the boy 's pants father gale told bishop daily he had black outs and did not remember the incident father gale was allowed to remain at the waltham church for seven years he was removed after more accusations but was transferred to a church in brookline in the 1980 's he was accused of molesting boys at a church run camp in new hampshire in 1991 father gale was removed from the brookline church apparently because of a drinking problem according to a report in the boston globe he moved into a south boston rectory but in 1994 the archdiocese received an accusation that he had kissed a teenager on the mouth at a christening in 1995 and 1996 with the archdiocese trying to settle lawsuits concerning father gale the church agreed not to allow him unsupervised access to children the documents show last month father gale was arrested and charged with four counts of raping an altar boy at the waltham church from 1980 to 1984
 the town of hempstead 's housing code piece by piece to a new nassau feb 16 is toothless the only way to put pressure on the homeowner with an illegal apartment is for the town of hempstead to mail a formal questionnaire the questionnaire would require the homeowner to answer yes or no to having an illegal rental under penalty of perjury and a hefty fine the town of hempstead has an official population of 760000 and a hidden population of 20 percent or 150000 people who are illegal renters these people vote on the school budget increase the school population burden the facilities of the county the town and special districts and clog the roads with overnight parking but pay no property or school taxes since this problem has been ignored for too long by our elected officials evicting 150000 people into the street without affordable housing available is irresponsible the only solution is to replace the present school and property taxes with an equitable residency income tax and let all the people pick up the cost not just the homeowners joseph m sardone franklin square
 nancy wilson spoke about her career in the past tense on monday night at avery fisher hall i wanted to sing songs she said in her tragic purr i wanted to interpret it was about the material it was about telling you some stories and i 've been doing that for a long time she may or may not be retiring as she put it she 's trying to stop touring as she also put it touring is a young word these days i work but in any case her performance was a retrospective representing more than 40 years in jazz pop and rhythm and blues most of it was with thickly piled orchestral accompaniment and a little with a jazz quintet including jeremy pelt on trumpet and vincent herring on alto saxophone ms wilson 65 and looking smashing comes from a time when the intersection of commercial adult music and the jazz subculture sprouted brilliant results the time of records like charlie parker with strings sarah vaughan 's work for the mercury label and ms wilson 's own recordings with cannonball adderley and gerald wilson but her guiding sensibility her aesthetic as an entertainer goes back further she 's like the omni american 1940 's film star both earthy and genteel her voice is a terrine of flat ohio vowels and affected britishisms her singing a mixture of flexible blues tonality and a more direct pop sensibility with such gifts one need n't worry about what constitutes jazz and what does n't but all things are n't equal she has her particular strengths the show 's up tempo songs strike up the band day in day out sprinted by without leaving much of an imprint what ms wilson can do best is to get inside a ballad and upend it drawing out some syllables and clipping others in a slow someone to watch over me when she got to the line i 'm a little lamb she turned on the jets for the first word spreading it out and drawing the marrow from it

 to the editor on environmental rules bush sees a balance critics a threat front page feb 23 judges environmental policy in the bush administration in five major areas but the most important factor in any such scorecard should be the effect of these policies on public health during the past decade we have come to better understand the link between utilities emissions and the epidemic rise in childhood asthma we have learned that toxic dumps create community cancer clusters if left unremedied and we know that common chemicals in pesticides disrupt the endocrine system affecting children 's intellectual and physical development the bush administration has yet to move strongly on these environment related health issues the effect on public health should become a priority in any environmental scorecard and in the actions taken by our policy makers robert k musil executive director physicians for social responsibility washington feb 25 2003
 it was just two weeks ago that the boats left viaduct harbor for their first battles in the three month slog that is the america 's cup challenger series the first of two round robins is now over and the nine syndicates competing for the right to race in february against the cup defender team new zealand have revealed if not their keels at least their identities they have separated into three distinct packs the rockets the duds and the emergency cases oneworld challenge and the swiss team alinghi are clearly the rockets in the series known as the louis vuitton cup oneworld is undefeated in eight races alinghi lost only to oneworld and by a mere 16 seconds while the boats are certainly competently helmed oneworld is skippered by the four time america 's cup veteran peter gilmour alinghi by the two time cup winner russell coutts it is their hull speeds that have to alarm the competition speed in america 's cup style match racing is a double whammy it allows a boat to get ahead of its competition then once upwind of its rival foul the air coming down the course slowing the other boat further the one high dollar boat that does not have speed is larry ellison 's usa 76 which sails for his team oracle bmw the ellison team took a gamble on a boat with less sail area than its competitors in the hope that the high winds of a new zealand spring would provide plenty of power the winds though have been volatile at the top of the permissible range one day at the bottom the next and ellison 's team has had mixed luck going 5 3 in the week off between round robins the second one will eliminate one of the nine teams team oracle will most likely do some serious reprogramming perhaps adding sail area up top or launching its second boat usa 71 if the fixes do not take ellison could end up watching the vuitton cup finals from the basketball court on the afterdeck of katana his 250 foot yacht the duds are easy enough to sort out the french team le defi areva has not won despite having a boat that streaks upwind it has lost two races at the finish line because of penalties and has yet to win a start the italian team mascalzone latino has only one victory against areva the italian team members the rascals as they call themselves are favorites in auckland partly because they have declared that their mission is to have fun but also because they do not pose a threat to team new zealand the emergency cases are the ones undergoing radical surgery in the case of patrizio bertelli 's prada challenge it is a nose job prada is replacing the blunt bow on its second boat with the elbowed bow in use by most of the other syndicates at 3 4 prada is the biggest surprise of the challenger series the team won the vuitton cup in 2000 but its second appearance in auckland has been a disaster after losing his first race bertelli fired his designer doug peterson now bertelli is after his boat with a hacksaw team dennis conner 's surgery happened a while back involuntarily when its second boat sank off long beach calif in july crushing the bow on the ocean bottom conner had the boat refloated and changed the bow slightly the results are still unknown usa 77 is still in its cradle in team conner 's compound on halsey street the other boat usa 66 has been nimble downwind but sluggish against the breeze conner who is 4 4 has a history of slow starts so no one is counting him out but he will have to make adjustments on land before big changes occur on the water for the british syndicate gbr challenge the procedure was total helmsman replacement after losing his first four races the leader of the syndicate peter harrison took the wheel from andy green and gave it to the slightly more weather worn andy beadsworth the british have not lost since they beat oracle in light air in the first round robin at 4 4 they are tied with team dennis conner and have set themselves up as most likely to be a spoiler in later rounds for now though the battle to watch when racing resumes tuesday is between oneworld and alinghi it is a clash of opposites with its environmental leanings and happy looking royal blue boat oneworld is the goody goody of the cup alinghi is the bad guy the syndicate head the billionaire ernesto bertarelli is a recluse alinghi 's boat is dark gray and menacing coutts won the america 's cup for new zealand in 1995 and repeated in 2000 before defecting to sail for land locked switzerland if his team wins the vuitton cup coutts will be sailing in auckland to take the cup away from the country where he grew up coutts and other defectors from team new zealand say their countrymen are supportive of their effort to be professional sailors but the loudest cheers in viaduct harbor last week were for oneworld when it returned from its 16 second victory over alinghi
 in a change in format the suffolk county republican committee 's convention on wednesday will be dedicated solely to edward romaine 's nomination as the county executive candidate leaving off the task of filling the rest of the party 's 2003 ticket for later in the month thomas m neppell jr the committee 's new chairman said last week that he had pared down the convention agenda to place great emphasis on the county executive race he declined to discuss whether the committee had picked candidates for the other countywide races on november 's ticket all 18 seats in the county legislature three in state supreme court and one in family court will be up for grabs supreme court nominations are generally announced in september but the legislature is weighing five competing proposals for redrawing its district boundaries making it impossible for any party to choose legislative candidates republican prospects have been dimmed by a projected 100 million budget shortfall for next year and a criminal investigation into the county 's open space preservation program the county executive robert j gaffney a republican chose not to run for a fourth term with mr gaffney out of the picture the county democratic leader richard h schaffer said he planned to cast mr neppell who was elected chairman on april 9 and mr romaine the county clerk as part and parcel of the gaffney administration they are both from brookhaven mr gaffney 's power base and mr neppell is also the town leader there we 'll run a very vigorous and well financed campaign countered mr neppell declining to discuss his committee 's strategy for distancing its reconstituted leadership from the previous administration he did say however that mr gaffney has pledged to contribute an as yet unspecified portion of the 13 million left in his own campaign coffers to the cause julia c mead

 it was only last sunday when the sun finally peeked out that my tomato plants stopped shivering and started to grow so i spent the afternoon putting cages around them imagining that they looked stronger at this show of confidence and planting basil all through their raised bed i do this not only because i love pesto but because i like to believe that basil enhances the tomatoes growth and flavor so do carrots supposedly but i ca n't grow a carrot in this clay soil to save my life companion planting or using one species to bolster the health or production of another has been part of garden folklore for centuries but proving what works which companion plants attract beneficial insects or repel pests and which enrich the soil is about as easy as finding a cure for the common cold it 's almost like the mind body connection if you believe that basil helps your tomatoes it will as arthur o tucker and thomas debaggio point out in the big book of herbs interweave press 2000 the idea was popularized in the united states in the 1940 's with the introduction of french intensive gardening rudolf steiner 's biodynamic principles paid similar attention to the soil and to the exchange of gases nutrients and compounds companion plants a 1943 pamphlet by richard b gregg and a book he wrote in 1966 with helen louise philbrick companion plants and how to use them devin adair 1990 were embraced by organic gardeners determined not to use pesticides and their monthly bible organic gardening magazine published frequent articles on the subject i know because i read the magazine cover to cover in the 1970 's when i first realized i did n't have to rely on the chemical arsenal my father used to grow broccoli i started growing more flowers and herbs right in the vegetable patch the goal long before biodiversity became a buzzword in the environmental movement was to attract beneficial insects though my favorite advice from the magazine was more mechanical than ecological vacuum flea beetles off the spinach in those days i followed the traditional combinations with near religious zeal i planted mint thyme and sage to repel the cabbage moth until the mint started overtaking my garden i sowed basil and borage to discourage the tomato hornworm though later i realized the parasitic wasp that deposited eggs inside the worm did a better job by simply having its larvae devour the hornworm from within and now i wonder if those borage flowers may have attracted the wasps in the first place sometimes i took trowel in hand the hornworms ultimate enemy companion i remember my remorse after killing the black and yellow striped caterpillar that was consuming my dill and parsley the larva of a black swallowtail butterfly i would never know i have also used companion plantings to divert and trap pests discarding the entire plant once heavily infested but then you wonder if you had n't planted that nasturtium for example to draw the aphids away from the broccoli and peppers would the aphids have simply avoided your garden in the first place one year i tried an american indian tradition known as three sisters planting scarlet runner beans up the stalks of sweet corn and letting acorn squash ramble beneath the stalks i had no damage that year from deer and thus believed what i had heard that deer do n't like to step among prickly vines but the food historian william weaver who grows heirloom vegetables in devon pa scoffed at that idea they eat squash believe me he said they love the tender buds corn a heavy nitrogen feeder can benefit from bean plants which take nitrogen from the air and move it to their roots where rhizobia a type of soil bacteria turn it into a form usable by not only the beans but also by other plants using the same soil but it is n't clear whether this is an immediate benefit or one that takes a while which would explain why farmers rotate their fields of corn and beans the traditions are many most unproven peas and carrots do well together but dill inhibits the growth of carrots summer savory helps the beans grow camomile enhances the flavor of cabbages cucumbers and onions robert kourick summed up a number of experiments in designing and maintaining your edible landscaping naturally metamorphic press 1986 one study for example indicated that tansy and catnip reduced colorado potato beetles on potatoes by more than 70 percent in another study catnip reduced green aphids on pepper plants by 91 percent marigold species not the hybrids discouraged nematodes but mr kourick concluded that it was less the one to one side by side effect of raising a certain plant next to another and more a matter of the general benefit of diverse plantings what 's fascinating to me is that in many cases the mechanism was the increase in predators or parasitic wasps mr kourick said last week from his home north of san francisco so it 's good to have a nice flower garden around your vegetables right and i 'm sure those nice flowers and herbs are playing very specific roles but i 'm always wondering which ones

 the united states war on drugs in colombia is rapidly being subsumed in the campaign against terror according to bush administration officials the indictments of three leaders of the marxist revolutionary armed forces of colombia or farc announced today in washington by the united states attorney general john ashcroft are just the latest in a series of american indictments against the leaders of the country 's two major insurgent groups carlos castano the head of the right wing self defense forces was indicted on drug trafficking charges in washington in september and four other men linked to the paramilitary group were indicted on drug related charges in houston this month the indictment unsealed today in federal court in washington accuses three farc military leaders including jorge briceno suarez widely considered the second most powerful man in the rebel organization of kidnapping and drug trafficking eight other lower ranking farc members were charged with the same offenses according to administration officials the indictments are part of a developing united states strategy of using the tactics of the drug war to help the new colombian government of president alvaro uribe to combat both the right wing paramilitaries and the marxist guerrillas who have been waging a 38 year civil conflict fueled primarily with drug money this is a two pronged approach said an aide to mr ashcroft we 're going after the drug traffickers and the terrorist groups at the same time the indictments are seen by the administration as the best and perhaps only way for washington to put direct pressure on the farc and the self defense forces known as the auc both groups are included on the administration 's list of terrorist organizations castano 's sins are many and multiple and they 're not just drug trafficking they 're also rape pillage and plunder said a high ranking bush administration official involved in shaping colombia policy in terms of crimes against the united states and us law drug trafficking is the most salient and the one we could get an indictment on the indictments also acknowledged implicitly that colombia 's justice system long criticized as weak and ineffectual could not be trusted to bring mr castano and his associates to trial since it is extremely unlikely that he would be prosecuted in colombia this indictment is a very positive step said jose miguel vivanco the director of the americas division for human rights watch which vigorously supported the drug indictments against the paramilitaries we should never forget they got al capone on tax evasion charges the new american tactics seem to be producing results even though mr castano and the farc leaders remain at large with little immediate prospect of their being arrested because it was singled out first by the bush administration the effects are most evident among the self defense forces a confederation with at least 12000 fighters that carries out mass killings and assassinations to erode support for the rebels the indictments have deepened divisions within the group paramilitary commanders in medellin and the surrounding countryside said in recent interviews as commanders weigh how involved in the drug trade their factions should remain they say that mr castano who has denied direct links to drug trafficking is trying to rein in those commanders who are heavily involved in it paramilitary commanders have long argued over the advisability of getting involved in the drug trade politically some felt it sent the wrong message for groups that were supposedly defending the law against left wing insurgents to be breaking the law themselves practically speaking many feared exactly what has happened that the involvement in drugs would make them vulnerable to prosecution the indictments have caused a very bad uneasiness among top paramilitary leaders said piolin a commander in medellin who works for adolfo paz who leads a powerful faction within the auc considered to have some of the closest ties to drug trafficking they worry that washington with its aggressive campaign against terrorism could take drastic action to capture or kill mr castano and other paramilitary commanders piolin said we are talking about the united states he added we are not talking about just any country infighting between commanders over the drug issue has become such a serious problem that two factions are openly fighting the paramilitary leaders say and alliances between others are in tatters in an interview in his mountain camp far outside medellin a top commander once closely allied to mr castano said that he and the 1500 men he leads in the so called metro bloc had split from the auc because they oppose the close ties other factions have with drug trafficking his group is openly fighting forces controlled by mr paz in the self defense forces the great majority are involved directly with narco trafficking said the commander who uses the alias rodrigo american officials are reluctant to claim credit for the new antiterror strategy or even to admit that it exists but they are clearly pleased with the unrest it has created if indeed the indictment had the impact of further splintering the auc and further calling into question the leadership of those who from our point of view are tied to drug trafficking so much the better the bush administration official said after the removal of congressional restrictions on american aid to antidrug programs the bush administration is also training specialized commando units and helping establish a reliable system of intelligence gathering that the units would use in pursuing insurgent commanders american troops will soon train a special 400 man commando unit that will track paramilitaries and rebels with an emphasis on hunting down leaders the american congress is also considering legislation to provide 5 million for the training of a colombian army unit dedicated to pursuing paramilitary chiefs those close to mr castano said the indictment had blindsided him because the paramilitaries have always viewed themselves as allies of the colombian army in their war against the rebels on his web site and in e mail messages to associates mr castano has called the indictment totally erroneous and charged that the rebels have manipulated the united states government in e mail messages to a confidant he has also expressed fears that the united states could bomb his camp

 in a crackdown on persisting fire safety violations at new jersey 's 31 public universities and colleges gov christine todd whitman has threatened to withhold state aid from any college that fails to make substantial progress in correcting violations by mid march a day after state inspectors revealed that they had found 828 fire code infractions at seton hall university last month following a fatal fire the governor revealed today that some of the state 's institutions of higher education had also been cited for fire code violations in recent months and had been slow to remedy them mrs whitman wrote to the presidents of the 31 institutions on feb 18 warning of cuts in state aid unless the schools made major strides in eliminating the violations in 30 days i know that you share my concern for ensuring the safety of individuals on your campus and i urge you to ensure that all violations are addressed expeditiously her letter said jayne o'connor a spokeswoman for the governor declined to identify the schools that had been lax in remedying violations for the most part they are minor like light bulbs burned out on exit signs ms o'connor said of the infractions mrs whitman ordered a general review of the state colleges adherence to state fire safety laws after an intense smoky fire in a third floor dormitory lounge killed 3 students and injured 58 others on jan 19 at seton hall a roman catholic university in south orange nj it was not immediately clear how old the infractions mrs whitman cited were inspectors from the state 's division of fire safety are required to visit the 31 institutions each year and examine their adherence to the state fire code similar inspections at new jersey 's private universities and colleges are by law to be conducted annually by local fire officials certified as fire code inspectors by the state 's department of community affairs which oversees the fire safety division but a team of 10 state inspectors began a campuswide evaluation at seton hall in early february after officials of the fire safety division visited boland hall the dormitory where the fire occurred and found violations the state team also stepped in because officials in south orange could not produce complete reports of the village 's annual inspections at seton hall for most years after 1984 when state law first required the inspections said charles richman an assistant commissioner for the department of community affairs mr richman said yesterday that department officials were concerned about both the depth and scope of past inspections at seton hall of the 828 violations the team reported finding in seton hall 's buildings mr richman said that many appeared to be so called maintenance violations that had accumulated undetected for a period of time common maintenance problems the reports cited were burned out light bulbs in exit signs missing fire extinguishers illegal extension cords multi plug electrical strips and lint in exhaust vents but the reports also cited potentially more hazardous problems including hallway and stairway doors at boland hall that did not comply with the fire code the boland report said that many interior stairways in the dorm were not equipped with the proper doors which are designed to withstand fire for an hour and keep flames and smoke from entering stairwells stairway doors did not open outward into stairways as required by the code the report said in addition the report said doors to students rooms and stairways in boland did not have the required automatic closing devices that force them shut after students pass through state officials would not say whether any violation was a factor in the fatal fire but a fire safety expert raymond mcfarlane chairman of the fire technology program at miramar college in san diego said today that stairway doors that open inward toward hallways could trap people trying to flee smoke and flames it 's a big problem if you get people pushing up against the door and there 's a panicked feeling and people are pushing up behind you and you ca n't get that door open said mr mcfarlane a former new york city fire lieutenant the state inspectors did not cite similar door violations in seton hall 's five other dormitories although the report on boland hall said the three door violations were common throughout the six story building inspectors could not be certain the improper doors existed near the third floor lounge that burned said e j miranda a spokesman for the community affairs department mr miranda said state inspectors were not permitted into the fire scene because it had been sealed by essex county authorities investigating the fire charlotte smith a spokeswoman for donald c campolo the essex county prosecutor who is heading the investigation said yesterday that officials had not yet determined if the fire was an accident or intentionally set mr richman declined yesterday to speculate on whether any of the improper doors in boland had contributed to the spread of smoke and fire he said the state inspectors would offer their opinions if mr campolo asked for them lisa grider a spokeswoman for seton hall said yesterday that university officials were baffled by the state 's report of 828 violations including the improper doors in boland because the department of community affairs conducted inspections at seton hall in 1996 and found less than 10 violations in all its buildings ms grider said all had been repaired in response mr richman said he believed that ms grider was referring to an inspection by the department 's bureau of housing which investigates the structural soundness of buildings but does not look for violations of the state fire code

popular many club owners and patrons say perhaps because the recently downsized are still living off severance packages or savings from the fat times there does not seem to be a great deal of despair over their unemployed status they are turning up at a wave of new clubs like lord of balls a lounge in japantown with a kitsch hunting lodge theme bliss in noe valley a red draped lounge that is

become an expert on its opposite sudden loss of wealth syndrome we have just come through this amazing growth cycle with very young people coming into oodles of money and that 's fun as long as that show is playing dr goldbart said but now we 're seeing a very different picture it 's a time for the diversifying of the psychological portfolio a time to think about having greater balance between work and other needs still he acknowledged that being out of work eventually will take a toll in stress not to mention financial difficulties these people may be in a bit of denial if they are not concerned about getting work he said but remember one thing it was that kind of optimism that has governed the psychology of wealth and the psychology of this economy that optimism may take them

 the unconquerable world power nonviolence and the will of the people by jonathan schell 433 pp new york metropolitan books henry holt company 2750 if any single grand theory emerges from the tangle of literature on international affairs it 's probably this beware of single grand theories an important corollary is to be especially wary of single grand theories based on historical uniqueness the premise that today we just happen to teeter at the fulcrum of history but jonathan schell a columnist at the nation and a longtime advocate of nuclear disarmament is not a cautious soul in the unconquerable world he argues that what we are witnessing today is nothing less than the end of armed conflict as we know it the war system that long pitted nations against one another is dying undone by politics and the development of ever more potent weapons a new nonviolent approach to politics is about to take its place unfortunately the unconquerable world does n't really work as foreign policy big think schell has not produced the kind of simple elegant coherence that made other recent grand ideas like francis fukuyama 's end of history and samuel huntington 's clash of civilizations such hits his theory is too complex and nuanced to make for dramatic reading yet not plausible enough to satisfy the serious student the vision he paints of his imagined future is a glorious one but he gives us frustratingly few ideas as to how exactly we 're supposed to get there the problem with war schell writes is that in the course of the last century it ceased to function the way that clausewitz described it as a final arbiter of conflict between states this failure resulted from two simultaneous trends one coming up from the bottom the other down from the top first people 's war which started with napoleon 's mass mobilizations of citizen soldiers was perfected in the 20th century by mao zedong and ho chi minh who used popular guerrillas to overwhelm larger and better equipped conventional armies the introduction and proliferation of nuclear weapons meanwhile made great power conflict all but unthinkable actual war fighting became less important than the appearance of advantage at least during the cold war when soviet and american strategists feinted and shadow boxed but rarely landed a punch schell argues that the combination of asymmetrical people 's war and nuclear stalemate has made traditional combat obsolete to buttress his case he considers four famous revolutions in each of which he argues bloodshed actually played far less of a role than is usually recognized the reader may be surprised by schell 's examples england 's glorious revolution as well as the american french and russian revolutions since at least two of these the french and russian revolutions are remembered as particularly gory but schell 's point is that though each of these rebellions may have become bloody most of the killing came late in the game the real revolutions occurred earlier in the hearts and minds of the people not on the field of mars political battles for popular loyalty should thus be considered far more important than military struggles turning away from conflict schell charts what he calls a parallel history the rise of purely nonviolent action in gandhi 's self reliant and fiercely ascetic satyagraha and the later huge bloodless revolutions that undermined the soviet empire schell finds great hope for how political change might occur in the future in them he sees violence disrupted or in retreat of course now is a particularly awkward time to be writing about the triumph of nonviolence as schell himself notes despite all the hopeful signs the rise of popular self determination the end of ideological division in the west and the growth of liberal democracy the world today faces even more threatening trends like globalized economic exploitation and nuclear weapons proliferation and there is another danger that strikes schell as more menacing still america 's current augustan inclinations cursed with too much power and under attack the republic has betrayed its roots by giving in to the temptations of empire force and bluster have replaced diplomacy and the once peaceful nation now approaches the world with a drawn imperial sword the results schell predicts will be disastrous and they will be washington 's fault well perhaps but if retaliating against the attacks on new york and washington was a mistake just what schell thinks the united states should have done is never made clear instead in the book 's final most vexing sections he proposes a number of bland steps toward world community that the nations of the planet should take together the list includes gradual nuclear disarmament the formation of a vaguely defined democratic league and the universal prosecution of crimes against humanity sounds good in fact the list looks remarkably similar to the international agenda of virtually every liberal democracy except this one therein lies a problem that schell refuses to deal with how to get the united states to agree to such measures which many americans view as threatening their jealously held sovereignty schell has little to recommend here other than to call for a sort of global nonviolent revolution based on a quasi mystical notion of cooperative power it 's not hard to see the difficulties with this approach schell 's attacks on current american policy which build quietly throughout the book before floridly erupting at the end are so strident that they will alienate all but a very self selected readership consider a passage like the following could it be the destiny of the american republic unable to resist the allure of an imperial delusion to flare out in a blaze of pointless mass destruction well perhaps but not likely no matter how distasteful one finds the language of the bush administration and so it 's hard to take the author of such words seriously a larger problem is schell 's obstinate rejection of the fact that even in 2003 warfare can and does still play a vital role in world affairs and not only vital but sometimes positive politicians from bosnia and kosovo to afghanistan and east timor credit their own freedoms indeed their very lives to the kind of armed intervention that schell excoriates and now many iraqis are doing the same the days when humanity can hope to save itself from force with force are over schell insists a nice thought but not everyone in rwanda or congo would agree in fact their complaint is that on the contrary no one was willing to exert force on their behalf jonathan d tepperman is the senior editor at foreign affairs magazine

 in january hundreds of millions of monarch butterflies were killed by a storm on their winter roosting grounds in mexico leaving scientists and countless monarch lovers wondering how the surviving insects would fare when they migrated back to the united states and canada now scientists have learned that as many feared monarch numbers plunged over large areas of the united states this summer particularly on the east coast where butterflies showed up late and in small numbers or did n't show up at all but more surprising a new study has found that these resilient insects have had what is adding up to be a surprisingly average year in the heart of their breeding range in the midwest it 's on the low side but still well within the realm of normal numbers said dr karen oberhauser of tallies from the corn belt where most of the monarchs that migrate to mexico are thought to originate an ecologist at the university of minnesota she leads a nationwide monarch monitoring project sponsored by the national science foundation she added i do n't think we can say the monarchs are in big trouble this year the data are collected by hundreds of volunteers who each follow a specific protocol monitoring a field or patch of milkweed plants the food plant of monarch caterpillars for the entire summer they count eggs and caterpillars also known as larvae with the entire group surveying a grand total of more than 25000 milkweed plants each week a unique combination of nature and science education and large scale scientific research the monarch larva monitoring project is the only long term systematic nationwide study of population fluctuations in this species of insect the study which is recruiting more volunteers has a web site wwwmlmporg cindy petersen a middle school science teacher in chanhassen minn has been monitoring a site with students for four years i was expecting the worst she said actually they did very well when i compare numbers with other years it 's been pretty stable but such results were little comfort to the many further east who spent the summer waiting for butterflies that never came it 's been awful this year said gillian tuttle a retired nurse and substitute teacher in moravian falls nc who never saw a single egg on the milkweeds she monitored on her rural property it 's alarming scientists say spring freezes in texas when the butterflies were arriving and widespread summer drought did not help monarch numbers this year either the university of minnesota study 's results were generally corroborated by the more informal fourth of july butterfly survey of all species organized each year by the north american butterfly association and by numerous anecdotal reports the die off last winter could still end up having lasting significance if as some scientists fear that was only the first of the major freezes the butterflies will encounter as loggers and residents continue to degrade the mexican forests or the die off could end up being a historical blip for these butterflies whose females can lay a whopping 700 eggs while many find the low numbers in the northeast worrisome dr oberhauser notes that if most of the monarchs in mexico do come from the corn belt as recent research suggests eastern populations might not have a huge impact on numbers that actually migrate in the most recent of the year 's unexpected tallies the fall migration along the east coast has been surprisingly healthy dick walton a naturalist and author who has monitored the monarch migration from the cape may observatory in new jersey in collaboration with dr lincoln brower at sweet briar college in virginia for the last 12 years said they had already seen some thick flights of monarchs we saw 108 yesterday afternoon and that 's a fairly good sample he said of counts during a five mile census i 'm actually a little surprised but cautioning that the migration was not even half over he said we need to wait and see what happens
 james e mcgreevey nearly ousted gov christie whitman a republican four years ago and now he is aiming to replace her successor acting gov donald difrancesco also a republican but at the moment mr mcgreevey is just the democratic mayor of woodbridge and as a sign of how much that means in state politics woodbridge is the latest undisputed winner of new jersey 's do n't dump on me sweepstakes the award is a brand spanking new all expense paid 45 million institution to house sex offenders who are deemed too dangerous to release from prison even after they have served their prison sentences everyone here is duly honored to be deemed worthy by not one but two governors of playing host to this group of fellow citizens less than a year after mr mcgreevey nearly beat governor whitman in 1997 his sprawling township emerged as the leading candidate for a new institution to house 300 sexual predators call them ingrates but woodbridge officials have been kicking and screaming for a couple of years now in public meetings and court documents saying they do n't want the sex offenders once mrs whitman left to join the bush administration mr mcgreevey asked acting governor difrancesco to review the decision last week the acting governor said there was no reason to change course mr mcgreevey politician that he is smells politics it 's pretty obvious he said in politics shipping 300 sex offenders to an opponent 's town is often viewed as a sign of disrespect i would expect jim mcgreevey to cry politics that 's what people running for office do said tom wilson a spokesman for mr difrancesco a person running for office in truth there 's some logic to selecting woodbridge there are already about 2500 prisoners in town divided between the east jersey state prison and the blandly named adult diagnostic and treatment center a special prison for sex offenders 650 of them these prisons are next to another center of state imposed punishment the rahway motor vehicle inspection station chris carden a spokesman for the department of corrections said the close proximity to the sex offenders prison will allow the new institution to use its resources and expertise as for the sex offenders they 're already there convicts who finish their sentences but are deemed unfit for release will simply move next door to the new institution this convenience of suburban incarceration is not a winning argument in woodbridge i think it 's an outrageous idea smack in the middle of a densely populated area said maria kocsis who lives near the state complex mr mcgreevey claims that the selection process was rigged to settle on woodbridge even though state officials say other places were considered mr mcgreevey honing his populist political rhetoric noted that none of new jersey 's wealthier suburbs were considered everything which is undesirable he said miraculously finds its way to the middle class neighborhoods that would mean woodbridge with nearly 100000 people in central new jersey woodbridge is the state 's sixth largest municipality aside from some pockets of big houses on wooded lots it is made up of mainly blue collar neighborhoods mr mcgreevey 43 is woodbridge 's omnipresent mayor the son of a trucking company salesman who got an ivy league education and made his way in local politics by working long hours and paying homage to party elders mr mcgreevey 's off the rack style seems to be reflected in the motto carried on main street banners woodbridge works woodbridge it seems also adjusts main street represents the forces at work in a middle class town polanka a polish american kitchen is a few doors from the carpet maven the building that once housed the woodbridge national bank is now auto parts of woodbridge residents are angry about the sex offender institution but they 're confident they will adjust to that as well unless of course mr mcgreevey is elected governor he says he would conduct a thorough review of the decision to put the institution in woodbridge it would all be based on facts not politics and he added it would be unlikely that woodbridge would be an appropriate selection
 a wine cork is much more functional than it may seem in restaurant kitchens cooks often use corks to stack plates with space in between they cut the corks in half diagonally so that there is a long flat side they lay three or four corks flat side down around the rim of a plate then stack another plate on top that way they can place garnishes on the plates in advance then finish the dishes as orders come in at home this could be handy for dinner parties prepared in small kitchens you could for example place a thin galette on each plate in advance stack the plates and then add a scoop of ice cream just before serving corks can also protect the tips of knives that you do n't use very often cut the corks in half across the middle then push them onto the tip of a knife but perhaps the best second use for corks is for pot lids whose steel handles get too hot to touch wedge a cork or two underneath the handle perpendicular to it and you will never need to struggle with a pot holder you can simply lift the lid by the corks which never absorb heat so drink up amanda hesser
 in an important ruling upholding free speech rights under the first amendment the supreme court this week overturned a pernicious law passed by congressional republicans to handcuff and muzzle the lawyers who represent poor people in civil cases under the federally financed legal services program by a 5 to 4 vote the court ruled that congress violated the first amendment in 1996 when it restricted the kinds of arguments that legal services lawyers may make on behalf of welfare clients the restrictions were imposed as part of a compromise after congressional republicans came perilously close to eliminating the legal services program altogether the law the republicans pushed through five years ago allowed poverty lawyers whose offices receive federal money to seek benefits on behalf of individual clients but it barred them from bringing litigation lobbying or participating in any rule making proceeding in an effort to challenge or amend welfare laws or regulations that circumscribing of the legal services that could be provided was what the court overruled this week writing for the majority justice anthony kennedy strongly seconded the reasoning used by a federal appeals court in new york two years ago when it struck down the provision on the grounds that its attempt to discourage challenges to the status quo amounted to impermissible viewpoint discrimination under the first amendment but justice kennedy went beyond that earlier decision and complained that the restriction distorted the whole legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys and by trying to insulate the government 's laws from judicial inquiry lawyers must be free to make all reasonable arguments he said and courts must be free to consider all arguments the court 's affirmation of first amendment values could have broad implications for other government efforts to curb free expression in programs financed by public money the decision could for example provide a basis for cultural and artistic institutions to resist efforts by politicians to censor the material they can display or perform if they receive public funding new york city 's mayor rudolph giuliani who seems to come up with a new legal strategy to cut back on taxpayer support for the brooklyn museum whenever he is offended by some of the art it displays would be wise to take the decision 's free speech stance to heart disappointingly the court did not seize the opportunity presented by this case to disavow its misguided 1991 ruling that upheld a prohibition on abortion counseling by family planning clinics that receive federal money justice kennedy was unconvincing in trying to explain why the first amendment prohibits muzzling government paid lawyers but somehow allows the muzzling of doctor employees in the family planning program his contention that the lawyers are speaking for their clients whereas the doctors are transmitting the government 's views on contraception and abortion seems a tortured rationalization designed to preserve an earlier decision at odds with the free speech values the court moved to defend this week
 mets manager bobby valentine sauntered toward a group of reporters at shea stadium last night like an eager gunfighter a small smile creasing his face i 'm ready for you valentine bellowed when a reporter chuckled valentine feigned incredulity and said you sound like you do n't believe me valentine knew what to expect as did mets general manager steve phillips five minutes earlier phillips leaned against a black cinder block wall beside the mets clubhouse and answered questions like a defense lawyer whose client had just berated the judge somehow phillips had to make that embarrassing client sound appealing again that was arduous since the mets have been unappealing for a month the mets can keep saying it is early in the season but this has been ugly april or not the mets have pitched horrendously fielded poorly and hit terribly six months ago they had just finished losing to the yankees in the world series but the confused mets were home last night and had to explain why what was supposed to be a splendid year has shown signs of deterioration it 's one thing to lose mike piazza said it 's another to lose the way we 're losing that 's what makes it frustrating phillips met with valentine and his coaches yesterday and searched for reasons the mets the national league champions had lost 15 of their first 24 games phillips asked two important questions over lunch what can we do with what we have what else can we consider while phillips and valentine would not reveal specifics about the meeting they obviously believe the mets will get improved starting pitching and some timely hits the mets had better for one night there was relief in flushing because the mets received both steve trachsel tossed six reliable innings three players had two out run scoring singles and piazza belted a three run homer to power the mets to an 8 2 victory over the astros last night it was one victory but it was a start for a team that should not be playing this raggedly it 's a lot better to win valentine said it was a good looking game lord knows we 've had some bad looking games this was a nice well played game i think we can build on the mets needed this after a brutal 3 6 road trip during which they were bruised for more than nine runs a game in the losses and had three hits in their previous 31 at bats with runners in scoring position they had four in their first seven at bats in that situation last night phillips minimized the importance of the meeting and said that the mets did this often still the timing of phillips 's session and his divulging it to the news media was noteworthy even phillips is wondering what is awry it 's one that i look at it and say who are we right now phillips said indeed who are these mets phillips went on to explain that benny agbayani and timo perez were on the disabled list before the season was even a week old and al leiter and robin ventura have also been injured he does not know who the mets are at this point because they have been incomplete during a troubling month jay payton laughed while conceding that the mets had been consistent as in consistently bad the mets have talked about promoting alex escobar their premier prospect who was hitting 299 with four homers at class aaa norfolk before last night but they are hesitant to do so because they do not want escobar to feel he is being viewed as a savior that is foolish if escobar can boost the mets by providing power he should be here now instead the mets spoke of trusting their player evaluations and waiting for this team to jell even if that happens the mets should know that the last team to make the postseason after being more than four and a half games out of a playoff spot at the end of april was the 1987 tigers today the 10 15 mets are four and a half games out of first place and a wild card spot there 's no doubt this team is a lot better than this record phillips said surroundings that was the all purpose word valentine used to describe why he is sure the mets will reverse themselves they play the next five at shea their players are getting healthy and they have not played even one sixth of the schedule they are in a division that does not have any team running away with first place the way the seattle mariners are in the american league west and they still have 64 games left against nl east teams i have no fear at all valentine said and i have total confidence in every team i 've ever been with including this one the mets insisted that this slump would not last deflecting dozens of questions about what is wrong and whether they need to make changes of course the mets should be playing much better and they have five months to gather themselves they began regrouping last night but there is one omen circling over them during a memorable 2000 when the mets won 94 games they never had a streak where they stumbled through 15 of 24 recall that when someone claims it is only may
 after insisting for months that it intends to let iraqis run their own oil industry the bush administration is expected to announce next week a plan that puts day to day control in the hands of senior iraqis within the oil ministry say people who have spoken with the administration and some former iraqi oil officials those people describe what would be akin to a corporate structure for the industry under the civil administration of the retired american lieutenant general jay garner a team of four or five iraqi oil officials would run the ministry with one of them serving as something of a chief executive said one person who had talked to the administration about its plans the outlines of which were first reported in the wall street journal yesterday the chief executive would report to and perhaps be part of an advisory committee that would include other iraqi ministry officials and foreigners from the united states and its allies in the war against saddam hussein the goal the person with knowledge of the plans said is to make sure that iraqis constitute a majority or plurality of those on the committee the advisory committee would be headed by philip j carroll the former chief executive of the shell oil company the united states unit of royal dutch shell he in turn would serve as the liaison to general garner the point is that the people of iraq and the people of the iraqi oil industry have their pride preserved said the person who had talked to the administration who spoke on condition of anonymity and that they are not dictated to by outsiders how much authority the committee mr carroll or general garner would have over the oil industry still has to be worked out said people with knowledge of the plans one test of the true power iraqis will have over their oil industry may be who actually determines which foreign companies win the lucrative contracts to repair iraq 's dilapidated but rich oil fields former iraqi oil officials in exile say the iraqi oil bureaucrats will want to pick the companies themselves in an open bid process it is also unclear who will serve in the management group and the advisory committee said people with knowledge of the plans a leading contender for a seat on the advisory committee is fadhil othman a former director of the state oil marketing organization which exported iraqi oil mr othman left iraq in the mid 1990 's and now reportedly lives in turkey he could not be reached for comment pentagon officials say that muhammad ali zainy an engineer and former official of iraq 's oil ministry is to become the senior iraqi at the ministry some middle east experts said that whatever the structure of the iraqi oil industry having an american like mr carroll at its head would fan claims in the region that the united states had invaded iraq to grab its oil carroll could have the best intentions said one congressional staff member but it 's going to confirm to everybody in the region that this was about oil the issue is still out there but others who had previously been skeptical of the administration 's aims said that this plan if put into effect would be an important step for the united states toward winning some badly needed good will in iraq i 'm glad that they will depend more on people inside than people on the outside said issam a r al chalabi a former iraqi oil minister who now lives in amman jordan i think it will give the structure more credibility and more authority

 an archaeological dig in andover has found remains of a medieval style long house the first one ever discovered in connecticut until now no long houses like this one 15 feet wide and 60 feet long had been found in new england dating from much past 1650 the andover house was built in 1705 historians say this long house challenges assumptions about traditional new england housing people think the typical new england house was a hall and parlor house with a central chimney but the archaeological evidence is showing us that we had a wide range of different types of houses including long houses said emerson w baker a history professor at salem state college in massachusetts dr baker an archaeologist lives in maine and is familiar with the half dozen long houses found there the andover house looked almost like a corridor said meg harper the president of public archeological survey team inc in storrs which finished excavating the site last month before it burned to the ground around 1750 the house had clapboard siding a cedar shake roof and lead lined diamond shape windowpanes imported from england the house contained small cellars at each end that were not connected a large hearth located off center and an odd secondary hearth in the west cellar that looks like a bastion at the corner of a fort ms harper said the long house form was common in western and northern england between ad 800 and 1600 and one end of the structure served as a barn for animals dr baker said the evidence in connecticut is so important because it shows that people throughout new england were building this form of architecture he said long houses have also been found in the plymouth duxbury area of massachusetts and as far south as virginia dr baker was not surprised that one turned up in connecticut i 've been predicting it for years he said nationwide about a dozen long houses have been discovered but it is likely they were once more common than that said robert blair st george a history professor at the university of pennsylvania who specializes in early american material culture and architecture they did n't survive he said i think there are a lot more literary descriptions of them but they were knocked down and not excavated the andover site was discovered during an archaeological survey required for a state road improvement project to provide safer access to route 6 by realigning lake road ms harper 's team found the edge of a stone cellar wall and some 18th century artifacts that triggered a more intensive survey and the archaeologists figured out we had an early house site and that it burned ms harper said the project historian bruce clouette determined that the house had been built by ephraim sprague a third generation colonist who came to andover from duxbury in 1703 mr clouette learned that sprague served as the captain of a local militia unit that fought indians in massachusetts from 1722 to 1725 represented the town of lebanon in the connecticut general assembly and became a deacon in the local congregational church virtually nothing is known about the lifeways of the average person coming into the frontier setting of southern new england ms harper said these are the kind of people who did not leave diaries the site was deemed eligible for the national registry of historic places which meant it could not be disturbed or destroyed unless there was no prudent alternative to the road project ms harper said since lake road could not be rerouted state department of transportation officials agreed to pay for a rare data recovery operation the department expects to spend nearly 300000 for the archaeological work data analysis and a public educational exhibit said pam rackcliffe a transportation planner in the newington office initially the archaeologists were puzzled by what the excavation turned up the original foundation 15 feet by 15 feet seemed just way too small for even a very small frontier dwelling ms harper recalled plus there was no evidence for any kind of heat source in that foundation they kept digging and 12 feet away they found evidence of ash believed to represent a large chimney base still they did n't know where the house ended so they followed a hunch we literally took the 15 foot depth multiplied it by four knowing that a long house ratio would be four to one and threw a test pit out 60 feet and landed right on the back wall at the end of the house ms harper said that back wall however was on private farmland outside the road project limits the property owner william sprague merritt unrelated to ephraim gave the archaeologists permission to dig in his cornfield last month they returned and uncovered the second cellar and its small hearth which confirmed that the building was a long house ms harper said originally ephraim sprague 's property was part of lebanon which was incorporated in 1700 three years before his arrival alicia wayland the town historian said there was hardly anything between that site and hartford it was really a wilderness area while excavating the site the archaeologists also recovered some 50000 artifacts including beads pieces of an imported china tea set spoons sewing scissors needles and thread handmade tools combs buckles from clothing and tobacco pipes finding a burned site is an archaeologist 's fantasy ms harper said because the ash creates a really favorable climate for nonburned remains her team found organic items like caches of corn and beans in a cold cellar parts of floorboards and pieces of cloth animal bone and antlers which typically deteriorate quickly in connecticut 's acidic soil on nov 29 the archaeological site was closed after a bulldozer pushed dirt back into the cellar and covered it next year ms harper said she expects to present professional papers on the site and a book size final report should be available in 2002 the site has been nominated for a prestigious federal highway administration 2001 environmental excellence award by the state department of transportation dr baker said the andover long house was important for future archaeology it forces us to look out for the unusual he said just like all the settlers in new england were not puritans not all of them lived in the same type of house
 i have to admit that of all the worthy and interesting movies opening this fall shattered glass was the one i was most looking forward to i also have to admit that the keenness of my anticipation made me a little suspicious of myself and of the movie which opens today in new york and los angeles the film written and directed by billy ray deals with the case of stephen glass a young writer and editor at the new republic who in the spring of 1998 was discovered to have fabricated in whole or in part more than two dozen articles he had published in that venerable journal of opinion as everyone discussing shattered glass is bound to observe there are obvious parallels between mr glass 's behavior and that of jayson blair the reporter who was found last spring to have invented or plagiarized portions of at least three dozen articles in the new york times but even if the memory of the blair scandal were not painfully fresh the earlier debacle would still exert a morbid fascination among journalists of a certain age and temperament the kind of people who spend way too much time surfing media gossip blogs and web sites and who are generally obsessed with tracking the behavior of the fish in the neighboring bowls those people i know a few of them are insular and self obsessed enough as it is and the last thing they oh all right we need is a movie that amplifies and feeds upon that narcissism shattered glass does that well enough at least i thought so but it is also i am happy to report much more than a knowing insidery docudrama about a magazine that has long prided itself on its inside the beltway knowingness the clinton era new republic is described several times with minimal irony as the in flight magazine of air force one the movie is a serious well observed examination of the practice of journalism and if it takes note of the vanity and obsessiveness that are among the vices of the profession it also acknowledges and perhaps romanticizes the hard work and idealism that are among its virtues but mr ray a screenwriter hart 's war making his debut as a director has grasped that the themes of this story ambition loyalty betrayal and deceit are not confined to journalism he has constructed an astute and surprisingly gripping drama not only about the ethics of magazine writing but also more generally about the subtle political and psychological dynamics of modern office culture glass played by hayden christensen is clearly motivated by a hunger for glory at work he is constantly receiving calls from important publications which he shrugs off with transparent false modesty are you talking to policy review someone asks him he replies with affected nonchalance it 's probably nothing but he also and perhaps more deeply has a desperate need for the esteem and affection of his colleagues his moments of greatest triumph seem to come not when the magazine publishes his fanciful articles about young republican debauchery at a washington hotel about a trade fair devoted to trinkets commemorating the clinton lewinsky scandal about a teenage hacker with an agent and a million dollar software contract but when he pitches them at editorial meetings working his audience like an anxious nightclub comedian he feeds on the laughter and amazement and his showboating is accompanied by displays of childlike insecurity i probably wo n't even do anything with it he says after rolling out one of his too good to be true story ideas waiting a beat for the praise and reassurance that are sure to follow are you mad at me he asks whenever someone raises even the smallest question about his work and of course no one ever is for a while at least glass 's eagerness to apologize for his small lapses deflects attention from his ever more extravagant lies mr christensen best known for his light saber work as the young anakin skywalker in the latest star wars episodes finds the perfect balance between creepiness and charm it is easy to see how the rest of the staff including the magazine 's beloved editor michael kelly hank azaria and a lightly fictionalized senior editor named caitlin chloe sevigny are taken in by glass 's brilliant little brother act midway through the film mr ray ingeniously and almost imperceptibly shifts the story 's center of gravity from glass to charles lane peter sarsgaard who took over after mr kelly 's abrupt dismissal and who brought glass 's journalistic felonies to light after an internet journalist named adam penenberg steve zahn began raising questions about the hacker article mr lane who now writes for the washington post is the hero of shattered glass and it should be noted that he also worked on the film as a paid consultant but mr sarsgaard 's performance is hardly a simple embodiment of nobility at the beginning lane seems cold and a little priggish aloof from the warm competitive camaraderie that binds the rest of the staff together as lane starts to investigate glass 's misdeeds he is suspected of pursuing a vendetta against writers loyal to kelly as we begin to see glass through lane 's eyes the film 's mood darkens and its pace accelerates what had started as a sharp workplace comedy becomes a clammy vertiginous psychological thriller the only false note comes near the end when the magazine 's moment of shame is rather too eagerly transformed into an occasion for self congratulation that lapse only underscores the movie 's overall meticulousness a more showily ambitious film might have tried to delve into glass 's personal history in search of an explanation for his behavior or to draw provocative connections between that behavior and the cultural and political climate of the times such a movie would also have been conventional facile and ultimately false mr ray knows better than to sensationalize a story about the dangers of sensationalism shattered glass is good enough to be true shattered glass is rated pg 13 parents strongly

 state department officials say they now have visas for the father of 6 year old elian gonzalez and five others and president fidel castro of cuba said the father could be ready to travel to the united states as early as tuesday the six visas could be issued tuesday morning to the father juan miguel gonzalez and 5 of the 28 cubans who had applied for the trip to the united states said james rubin a state department spokesman but exactly when mr gonzalez would arrive and how he would take custody of his son if he gets here were still very much in doubt this evening the cuban government wants to send a large delegation on the trip to retrieve the boy a group that includes a psychiatrist classmates of elian mr gonzalez 's cuban family and the president of the national assembly ricardo alarcon an adviser to mr castro the six visas that were granted were for elian 's father stepmother an infant half brother a cousin his pediatrician and his kindergarten teacher the other visas are still being considered american officials said the united states interest section in havana will be submitting a list of questions to the cuban government as it considers the other applications to travel to the united states with the boy 's father mr rubin said when asked why such a large delegation was necessary the father 's lawyer gregory b craig said he would not support every name on the list but that the pediatrician and family members made perfect sense if the delegation must wait several weeks for a decision in the courts mr craig said mr gonzalez was not willing to come alone and sit for nine weeks without his family but as the state department prepared the legal paperwork to allow the boy 's father into the united states it was still unclear exactly how a transfer of the boy either from elian 's miami relatives to federal officials or from the miami family to the father himself would be accomplished in the volatile atmosphere surrounding the standoff an official with the immigration and naturalization service said tonight that the agency would begin transferring custody of the boy from his great uncle in miami to his father but that that did not mean that immigration officials had immediate plans to take elian from the home where he has lived with relatives since november the immigration official said the agency did not want to add any trauma to the boy 's life in an already tense situation immigration officials had demanded that elian 's miami relatives sign a document by tuesday morning saying they would hand the boy over if they lost a court fight in the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit in atlanta in may to keep him if they did not sign it immigration officials said they would revoke the boy 's immigration status and begin the process of ultimately removing the boy from the home here which is guarded by cuban exiles who say they will not allow the government to take the child but today immigration officials dropped their demand to revoke elian 's status maria cardona a spokeswoman for the immigration and naturalization service said only that our goal is to reunite elian and his father the issue is not whether we will transfer elian to his father ms cardona said but when and how mr craig said the boy 's miami family was making this very very difficult for us but he said he expected the relatives here to agree perhaps as early as tonight to some kind of eventual transfer but with conditions in havana today mr castro and the boy 's father were the focus of a rally of about 3000 college students from the caribbean and latin america the students called for elian 's return we want elian down with the lie the students chanted mr castro has offered two proposals for handing over the child in one the delegation of 28 people would care for elian in washington as the custody battle is decided in the courts the boy 's miami relatives have said they will appeal the case to the united states supreme court if they lose in the appeals court in atlanta but if american officials are willing to hand the child over to him immediately the father said he would leave for the united states as early as tuesday now that his visa has cleared i do not want to talk to any kidnapper nor accept any condition mr gonzalez said but it is highly unlikely that any transfer would be quick and easy as about 100 demonstrators again gathered outside the boy 's house in little havana thousands more are on call to join them at a moment 's notice all swearing that they will never allow the boy to be taken from the home the boy 's miami relatives have said they do not want the child to be traumatized in any way but his great uncle lazaro gonzalez said last week that he would not bring the boy out of his home and that government officials would have to come in and get him late last week the boy 's miami relatives said that elian 's father was verbally abusive to him on the telephone and that he told the boy that his mother who drowned in a crossing with him from cuba in november was still alive they 're preposterous mr craig said of the accusations they have a close and loving relationship father and son he said it was a desperate 11th hour effort to try and paint the father as something he is not officials were quoted late this evening by the associated press as saying elian 's father and his family would stay at the home of fernando remirez chief of cuba 's diplomatic mission in washington mr remirez his wife and two children will leave their home in suburban maryland and go elsewhere to make room for the gonzalez family the officials said
 to the editor modern classical music is in such a sorry state because it is produced largely by people who can make a living without pleasing their audiences if a manufacturer painter sculptor or filmmaker produces goods that people wo n't buy they go out of business but not modern composers they receive commissions from opera companies and symphony orchestras guilt ridden for not being more involved in contemporary music and hold down comfortable academic positions guilt ridden audiences put up with listening to the works once but rarely enjoy the process so what 's to be done give up on new music or force it down throats of course not let 's try the market the way all the other arts do anthony tommasini did not even mention the only two serious american composers who make a living composing and who perform to sell out audiences of mixed ages philip glass and steve reich if contemporary music is to have a chance its distributors ie the performers must be more discriminating they must determine which new works the audience enjoys the most just as other distributors do they must stop playing the modern music they like and start performing what audiences like not schoenberg 's 12 tone trivia but the dances of glass and if these composers sink from favor as most of them will scrap them too robert w wilson manhattan the writer is a former chairman of the new york city opera
 four years ago i pointed out that no two countries that both had mcdonald 's had ever fought a war against each other since they each got their mcdonald 's i drew from that what i called the golden arches theory of conflict prevention which stated that once your country became a mcdonald 's country it meant your people did n't like to fight wars anymore they preferred instead to wait in line for burgers the golden arches theory had nothing to do with the power of burgers i was simply using it to illustrate that while globalization and economic integration symbolized by the spread of mcdonald 's could not end geopolitics and war they were clearly having a restraining effect on aggressive nations in addition to classical military deterrence because the costs of war for globalized nations were now so much greater well the golden arches theory is now about to get its first real test china versus taiwan these are two separate countries each obsessed with asserting its own national identity but each now woven to the other and to the rest of the world by a web of economic interests and 578 mcdonald 's so profound and far reaching that if this web ca n't restrain them then nothing will consider the following some 40 percent of all chinese exports go to the us over 25 percent of china 's gdp comes from foreign trade taiwanese companies have invested 40 billion in factories on mainland china china is fast becoming one of the most internet wired countries in the world taiwanese factories are the leading suppliers in the world of 13 key parts that go into every computer or internet router in many cases taiwan is the only supplier of certain key computer parts the whole global computer supply chain would be disrupted by a war over taiwan bye bye nasdaq in short it 's hard to find two more globally and mutually dependent countries but it 's also hard to find two countries more viscerally committed to their own particular national identities and to the flourishing of their own particular roots and branches communist china covets taiwan in order to complete the historic reunification of china now that hong kong and macao have been reintegrated and taiwan 's election has brought to power there for the first time a leader who represents the yearning of taiwanese to govern themselves and to never again be ruled by others china ca n't shoot taiwan without shooting itself taiwan ca n't pull away from china without pulling its own economy down and any sharp move by either will destabilize the world that 's what globalization is all about think about it americans will not and should not stand by and watch taiwan a country shaped in our own image be snuffed out by beijing a china that invades taiwan is a china that can forget about selling goods in america for a long time it 's a china that can forget about joining the world trade organization will rationality prevail the problem with beijing taiwan and washington says the china scholar mike oksenberg is that each assumes that economic rationality will prevail in the other two capitals and that the other two will understand the political pressures in its own capital and therefore cut it some slack that 's a dangerous assumption china scholars note that when china 's progressive prime minister zhu rongji threatened taiwan last week against making any move toward independence there was a certain pleading quality to it almost as though mr zhu was saying do n't you guys understand i 'm sitting on a powderkeg the whole scene echoed that day in 1989 when the chinese leader at the time zhao ziyang went to tiananmen square and pleaded with tears in his eyes for the students to leave because he knew what demons lurked inside his own politburo well those demons those chinese leaders whose motto is when in doubt use force are still there but china has become a real mcdonald 's country since and this is a test of whose logic will prevail there is a war just waiting to be fought in the taiwan strait but there is also a nobel peace prize just waiting to be won there waiting for the statesman who can persuade the parties that precisely because they ca n't live without each other they have to find a new way to live with each other i repeat this is a test
 peter pinchbeck an english born painter who worked in an abstract expressionist vein was found dead in his loft in soho on sept 10 he was 69 the cause was cardiovascular hypertensive disease his family said he was found by friends after they became concerned when he failed to appear for the first day of classes at manhattan community college where he had taught art history painting and composition for nearly 30 years mr pinchbeck was a tall courteous man who sprinkled his writings on painting with quotes from jacques derrida and stephen hawking except for a brief phase of streamlining in the mid 1960 's when he was included in primary structures an early exhibition of minimal art at the jewish museum he spent most of his career exploring the clearly hand wrought surfaces and figure ground relationships introduced by the abstract expressionists at the same time his frequently planar compositions reflected the influence of the russian constructivists he said he felt that gestural abstract painting with its self evident brushwork could create an experience of time and space that differed from that of reality science and most other kinds of painting in the 1970 's and 80 's his canvases tended to be dominated by burly squarish shapes that sometimes seemed to close off space or plummet through it in the 1990 's his colors heated up and his shapes became more playful eventually evolving into buoyant barbell volumes that appeared paradoxically to be continuous with the light filled space they inhabited mr pinchbeck was born in 1931 in london and studied at the twickenham college of art and the polytechnic art school both in london intrigued by the abstract expressionists he moved to new york in 1961 and his work began appearing in east 10th street gallery group shows he had his first solo show at the paley lowe gallery in soho in 1970 his most recent one at the june kelly gallery in 1989 he is survived by his wife the writer joyce johnson of manhattan from whom he had been separated since the early 1970 's and their son daniel a writer and co editor of open city an art and literature magazine also of manhattan
 the word god does not appear in the constitution of the united states a document that erects if not quite a wall at least a fence between church and state in god we trust began to appear on american coins in the 19th century but in the early 20th century president theodore roosevelt having asked the sculptor augustus saint gaudens to design new coinage was relieved to find no statute mandating in god we trust on coins as the custom altho without legal warrant had grown up t r wrote to a clergyman distressed over the prospect of godless coins i might have felt at liberty to keep the inscription had i approved of its being on the coinage but as i did not approve of it i did not direct that it should again be put on t r expressed his very firm conviction that to put such a motto on coins not only does no good but does positive harm his objection to in god we trust was not constitutional it was aesthetic he felt that the motto cheapened and trivialized the trust in god it was intended to promote in all my life i have never heard any human being speak reverently of this motto on the coins or show any sign of its having appealed to any high emotion in him he wrote indeed he added the existence of this motto on the coins was a constant source of jest and ridicule congress devoted then as now to religiosity overruled t r and made the motto mandatory a similar issue now arises from the decision by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit that the insertion of the phrase under god in the pledge of allegiance is unconstitutional the pledge of allegiance was written in 1892 by francis bellamy a former baptist minister as part of the celebration of the 400th anniversary of what our politically incorrect ancestors called columbus 's discovery of america bellamy was a christian socialist dedicated to the ideal of a cooperative commonwealth his unpopular socialist critique of capitalism from the pulpit forced his resignation from the ministry soon afterward he joined the staff of the youth 's companion the once famous children 's magazine which printed his pledge of allegiance on sept 8 1892 francis bellamy said on flag day in 1931 a short time before his death that the pledge was born out of my own love of the flag and for all the lofty americanism it represented two alterations have been made in bellamy 's text in 1924 my flag became the flag of the united states of america and in 1954 congress changed one nation indivisible into one nation under god indivisible this second change came about in order to emphasize the antagonism between god fearing americans and godless communists as if that antagonism needed reinforcement in the age of joe mccarthy from this day forward president dwight d eisenhower said in signing the law the millions of our schoolchildren will daily proclaim the dedication of our nation and our people to the almighty t r 's objection to the cheapening of religious avowals had long since been forgotten eisenhower also said our government makes no sense unless it is founded on a deeply held religious belief and i do n't care what it is bellamy would have objected strongly to this change as it changed the fundamental meaning according to his granddaughter barbara bellamy wright he had considered that 'one nation indivisible conveyed the deep meaning that after the civil war our nation could not be divided she said and the reference to god tampered with the original meaning of the pledge as well as spoiling its rhythmic cadence yet a hysterical clamor has risen against the ninth circuit decision and in favor of returning the pledge to the original text a text that americans found quite satisfactory for nearly two thirds of a century the under god addition by identifying patriotism with religion excludes agnostics atheists and all believers in some deity or deities other than the christian god nor does the under god addition meet theodore roosevelt 's test of promoting reverence and appealing to high emotions doubtless all the crooks in the corporate community have recited the pledge without notably improving their conduct as for the constitution more than a half century ago the supreme court in west virginia state board of education v barnette declared unconstitutional a law requiring schoolchildren to salute the flag and recite the pledge of allegiance if there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation justice robert h jackson memorably said for the court it is that no official high or petty can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics nationalism religion or other matters of opinion the court handed down its decision against compulsory pledges of allegiance and flag salutes on flag day in 1943 when young americans were fighting and dying for that flag around the planet the american people then far from denouncing the court applauded the decision as a pretty good statement of what we were fighting for are we backsliding today perhaps the next step for those who identify patriotism with religion will be to try to amend the constitution itself by mentioning god arthur schlesinger jr is the author most recently of a life in the 20th century
 the police chief his offerings of fresh information running thin could offer only a guess today that the elusive dead aim sniper may be gloating nearby in a suburban enclave much like this one kevin boink a local resident bucking the mood of fear by going shopping agreed as he skirted a gasoline station where on thursday the rifleman killed one victim with a single shot from afar i feel like most people that this guy 's our neighbor mr boink said taking a casual look around he stood in the sort of prosaic shoppers parking lot that the police theorize the sniper has favored since wednesday the shooter has killed six people at random and wounded a seventh in a 50 mile swath of washington suburbs i tend to think he lives a few miles from here and he 's more meticulous than the usual thrill killer mr boink said adding his theory to the speculation that has been flooding the region in lieu of facts i do n't think he 's done he 's going to do something else this was also the fear of police chief charles moose of montgomery county when he imagined the killer safely gloating in a news conference this morning the first of four the chief asked the public once more to call with any fresh bit of information we remain convinced someone in our county knows who 's engaged in this chief moose said suggesting that an altered routine or a touch of strange behavior could signal someone as a suspect we 're not convinced we 've talked to the right people yet he said the suspicion that the gunman remains nearby was bolstered this evening when chief moose introduced dr kim rossmo a criminologist who will apply his new specialty as a geographic profiler to try to find the killer 's likely neighborhood using a computer technique developed in canada dr rossmo will work in montgomery county with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms by inserting all known data including information from the crime scenes hundreds of tips and criminal behavior patterns into the program geographic profiling manages information but it does not solve crimes dr rossmo said it could be useful in solving the needle in the haystack problem when investigators are flooded around the clock with information suspicions and tips as in this case he said dr rossmo said the technique had been used in canada and britain with some success in investigations of multiple homicides rape theft fraud and other felonies on average we can determine where an offender lives within the top half square mile of a crime scene measuring 10 square miles once the data is fed in and cross referenced dr rossmo said he added that the computer would not be stymied by the fact that the sniper here ranged 50 miles farther afield on friday when he wounded a woman in fredericksburg va chief moose quickly stepped in to emphasize that he was trying geographic profiling as one more tool in a difficult investigation we 'll see how helpful it is he said the police still searched for a white cargo truck that the one known witness told detectives had sped from a shooting scene on thursday in a two hour rampage in which four people were shot at separate locations within five mile of one another in montgomery county the sixth victim was killed thursday night just across the county line in washington and the virginia woman was wounded the next afternoon investigators conceded that the manhunt would have to cover a much larger part of the washington commuter area chief moose again played down the arrest on an unrelated auto theft charge of robert baker 33 a montgomery county resident who was the subject of phone tips about his possible involvement with guns or a militia movement he is not a suspect chief moose repeated even as more tips about gun fanciers poured into the police hot line on this clear sunny day residents moved gingerly about town in a mood summed up by doug duncan the montgomery county executive every day you wake up and there has n't been another reported shooting is a good day mr duncan said puzzlement vied with grief at the funeral this morning of premkumar a walekar 54 a cabdriver who was shot on thursday as he fueled his taxi here at a mobil station across from a parking lot i do n't know what the killer gained lazarus borge a relative said at mr walekar 's funeral in takoma park md i do n't know how he profited by killing an innocent god fearing person who has a loving family at home the police theorize that the sniper used a long range hunting rifle or a military assault rifle to fire from cover and sped away from the crime scenes without being seen or leaving evidence his victims were shot once six died almost instantly and the seventh a woman shopping in fredericksburg va was severely wounded in the back smoking gun type leads maybe are n't there chief moose said at a news conference but detectives have more than 800 tips to pursue and are asking for more he warned against simplistic labels that could cause tunnel vision in the search saying the terms terrorist thrill killer or serial killer did not seem to fit the sniper 's pattern so far wary residents tended to agree this guy is much more meticulous than the typical spree killer mr boink maintained sounding as authoritative as anyone else in the target zone of the killer and now of the geographic profiler
 given the course of british knighthood it 's probably no surprise to learn that mick jagger has been newly dubbed sir mick jagger but it does provoke a certain sadness there was a sir ness to sir paul mccartney long before it became official an acknowledgment of how much music hall as well as beatle there was in him even if there was never as much difference between the beatles and the rolling stones as we liked to believe they at least stood for different tensions within rock 'n roll the difference between the rebellion implicit in a kind of musical ecstasy and rebellion as actual insurrection the premise of the rolling stones was that you could n't contain them that has long since ceased to be true and sir mick proves it when asked about the anti establishment stance of the early stones sir mick according to reuters said i do n't really think the establishment as we knew it exists any more this is the sort of thing one says when one has long since become part of the establishment but he 's right of course there is n't the sense of a punitive establishment trying to squash the expression of young people if they choose to seek it in the trappings of cultural rebels why squash it when you can own it but there 's no point blaming sir mick he was working within a cultural system the recording industry that had been co opted from the start but just think of all those promises the young devils made never to grow old or to stop playing rock 'n roll long before they did as the old devils get even older their young selves look less devilish

 two palestinian gunmen attacked this israeli settlement at the northern edge of the gaza strip on tuesday night killing a young couple and wounding 15 others in the boldest and deadliest assault on such a community in more than a decade after a three hour standoff the two gunmen were shot dead at about 11 pm tuesday by israeli sharpshooters the raid appeared calculated to destroy the already battered cease fire between israelis and palestinians it came a day after reports that the united states had been planning before the sept 11 attacks to introduce a vision of peace that included a palestinian state as the sun came up israeli tanks could be seen shelling palestinian controlled territory in gaza south of here in what appeared to be large scale operation bursts of machine gun fire sounded in the distance as tank treads sent up clouds of dust the house in which the gunmen made their last stand was pocked with bullet holes this morning the bodies still inside as some israeli soldiers looking exhausted left the settlement others were still detonating hand grenades that the attackers had left around the nearby houses a yellow robot was used to handle unexploded ordnance most of the settlers remained in their houses as the soldiers attended to the remaining grenades one settler avi fahrhan a pistol at his hip paused as left his settlement this morning to show a handful of spent ak 47 cartridges he had collected after the raid yasir arafat the palestinian leader condemned the attack and promised a quick and decisive limit to any breaches of the cease fire but in a speech while the firefight was still under way ariel sharon the israeli prime minister ridiculed the notion that mr arafat had abided by the truce everyone is happy arafat declared a cease fire mr sharon said in a speech tuesday evening but the fire did not stop for one minute not for one minute mr sharon faces pressure inside israel to respond to the attack swiftly and decisively and from the united states to show restraint as the bush administration tries to put together a coalition that includes arab nations to fight islamic terrorists on tuesday night under a full moon the gunmen had found their way past the fence surrounding the settlement on at the edge of the mediterranean sea they shot the young couple a young woman from the settlement liron harpaz 19 and her boyfriend assaf itzhaki 21 who was from a nearby city then burst into several houses hurling grenades and firing kalashnikovs settlers barricaded themselves in their homes as the relatively small patrol of israeli soldiers guarding the settlement tried to repel the attack antiterror squads in unmarked vans raced to the scene merging with a steady stream of jeeps armored trucks and ambulances entering the settlement the soldiers feared that the gunmen had taken hostages in at least one of the houses but when the shooting stopped it appeared they had not concerned that there might be a third gunman soldiers searched the area with dogs but turned up no one of the wounded seven were soldiers and eight were civilians one of the injured soldiers was said to be in serious condition but the rest had slight to moderate injuries the militant group hamas which scorned the cease fire claimed responsibility for the attack it described the raid in a statement released in gaza in which it said zionist security was soft and weak gen derom almog of the israeli southern command said that his intelligence sources confirmed that hamas was behind the assault both men were in uniform he said and one man wore a hamas bandana but in an interview at his command post this morning general almog accused mr arafat of encouraging such violence from one side arafat continues speaking of cease fire but from the other side in his own language he is speaking about continuation of intifada he said this is a strategy of doubletalk mali halim a resident of the neighboring settlement of dugit wept tonight as she described the couple who were killed friends she said of her children it 's not like living in town she said of life in the settlements it 's one family settlements are among the sorest of points between israelis and palestinians who consider them colonial outposts illegal under international law some settlements particularly those in the heart of the gaza strip and near palestinian villages in the west bank are heavily fortified and a few of them now can be reached safely only by armored vehicle but alei sinai which plans to celebrate its 18th anniversary on thursday was seen as a more established less intrusive settlement at the margin of palestinian land as a result it was not as heavily defended and it apparently made an easier target mrs halim said that alei sinai and her settlement of dugit had asked repeatedly to have their fences electrified but that the government refused to cover the expense while the settlement had not been attacked before the sound of gunfire was so familiar that mrs halim did not think much of it as she left for work this evening we wake up with shooting and go to sleep with shooting she said it 's routine we 're under siege mr arafat was said by advisers to be very angry over the attack in a statement he promised appropriate measures from the palestinian side to secure the respect for the cease fire and to put a quick and decisive end to any violations from our side earlier in the day mr arafat took one step that the israelis had been demanding of him he arrested atef abayat a leading palestinian militant in bethlehem whom israeli security officials accused of involvement in the drive by killing two weeks ago of an israeli settler sarit omrani members of mr arafat 's own faction fatah strongly protested the arrest as politically motivated calling mr abayat innocent under the terms of their cease fire the israelis were to begin easing restrictions last friday on palestinian areas in exchange for a crackdown by palestinians on militants but progress under the agreement was grudging fighting in recent days had left at least 19 palestinians dead and more than 200 wounded a car bomb that exploded monday morning on a jerusalem street further strained the cease fire in washington on tuesday mr bush called the creation of a palestinian state part of the long term vision for peace in the region mr sharon has made at least a rhetorical gesture toward the same goal but israeli officials are alarmed by a perceived tilt in washington at least at the state department toward the palestinian cause since the attacks on the united states

 the tragedy of the israeli palestinian conflict has always been that the moment a glimmer of hope for coexistence appears the forces of rejection and violence come calling yesterday just as a new palestinian leadership seemed to be clearing the way for a new era a powerful bomb went off at a seaside cafe in tel aviv the work of a suicide bomber it claimed the lives of at least two victims it must not be allowed to claim the new chance for peace as well the palestinians passed a milestone yesterday when their legislature approved a new reform minded cabinet under a new reform minded prime minister that should lead to the unveiling of the final settlement promised by president bush and drawn up with europe the united nations and russia for the first time since the collapse of the clinton peace talks and the onset of the 2000 palestinian intifada it was possible to begin imagining a way out of the cycle of death and retribution it was hardly a coincidence that the explosion came just after the new palestinian prime minister delivered an inaugural speech decrying terrorism the extremists behind the tel aviv attack were undoubtedly aiming their violence at their own leadership as well as the israelis they can not be allowed to succeed there will be enormous obstacles to peace all those involved israelis palestinians americans and europeans must be prepared to show determination courage and energy the terrible attack yesterday will be only the first test the speech of the new prime minister mahmoud abbas to the legislative council yesterday was promising he not only denounced terror but he also acknowledged jewish suffering and concerns but as the events that followed so tragically illustrated much more than words will be required of him and of prime minister ariel sharon of israel to surmount the last 31 months of violence both face powerful resistance mr abbas from militant rejectionists mr sharon from his right wing which demands that the peace plan called the road map be rewritten into a set of conditions the palestinians must meet before the israelis make any concession the europeans the russians and the united nations must also pitch in but the united states must play the central role forcefully guiding both sides toward a set of concrete criteria for every stage of the plan and monitoring when they have been met throughout this effort the administration must stand ready to rescue the peace process when it is tested as it was on the day of its beginning
 what was once a grisly scene of carnage here a smoky pile of bodies and concrete was transformed today into a tranquil city park the aug 7 memorial park opened its gates this morning on the site of the united states embassy destroyed by a terrorist bombing here exactly three years ago the blast killed 207 kenyans and 12 americans but it altered far more lives than it ended lucy kiongo lost her daughter and her husband today she wiped away tears as she said she did frequently but her emotions were even more intense this morning as she spotted the names of her loved ones etched in black granite at the new park even without the memorial i would never forget ms kiongo said but it 's nice thousands of others poured into the park after dignitaries from the kenyan and united states governments had opened it with a formal ceremony in the morning the memorial in the middle of chaotic downtown features a fountain benches manicured lawns and a sculpture constructed from some of the twisted metal and chunks of concrete left after the explosion elen ogindo stood near where she had been standing at the time of the blast she said she was waiting for a bus when the loudest noise she had ever heard rang out she recalls little else but still lives with pain from the flying debris that tore into her head after aug 7 she said nothing was the same for me president daniel arap moi used the commemoration to call on the country 's security forces to be extra vigilant at the borders so that no weapons or suspicious individuals entered mr moi said the bombing demonstrated in a most crude and violent manner that peace is a fragile entity that should not be taken for granted four suspected followers of osama bin laden the saudi financier of islamic militancy were convicted this year in federal court in new york of carrying out the nearly simultaneous bombings of the american embassies here and in tanzania the ambassador at the time of the bombing prudence bushnell returned today from her new post in guatemala city since i left you i have traveled through shock pain despair and hope said ms bushnell who was trapped in the wreckage for more than an hour as i stand here where there was the rubble of the american embassy and ufundi house an adjacent seven story office building i also find the treasure of peace and friendship the united states which is constructing a replacement embassy in a more secure spot outside of downtown has spent 423 million since the bombing to assist the thousands of victims but that support has not been enough in the opinion of some kenyans the aid has paid educational expenses for 1410 children of victims and helped 60 business owners rebuild their damaged shops in addition medical care has averaged 1282 each for hundreds of victims according to officials at the african medical and research foundation the costliest case was that of a street child david maina whose jaw was torn off as he rode in a bus near the blast site but the american assistance for victims is scheduled to end soon and some who were injured in the blast do not buy washington 's view that it is not to blame for the terrorist act if it were not for the us embassy being there then i would have two eyes right now said argwings kodhek 30 who lost his left eye in the bombing i 'm not saying they 're liable but we suffered because of america mr kodhek has joined nearly 3000 other victims in a suit against the government organized by the bomb blast legal rights project but it was not only the level of united states assistance that caused outrage justice r o kwach chairman of the trust that built the park said at the opening that visitors would be charged a 25 cent entry fee to help maintain the green space that prompted widespread grumbling from the thousands who gathered to watch the ceremony how can they charge us to honor the dead one woman said
 if you are in the mood for a warm belly full of porridge there is no shortage of raw materials in addition to staples like steel cut oats and hot rice cereals there are ancient grains packed so full of proteins amino acids calcium and fiber they make brown rice look like junk food porridge you ask if the word sounds antiquarian it is no wonder porridge has been stuffed into a pouch of instant flakes and appropriated by the microwave tear here i figured i could top that nostalgic for true flavor at breakfast and impressed with the sheer abundance of exotic whole grains i posed a challenge to myself to find smooth cashmere flow and a pleasant chew in the same bite a sort of breakfast pilaf think you know your grains be careful the picture can become fuzzy fast grains are the edible seeds of annual grasses like wheat barley and oats when a grain is cultivated for human consumption it becomes a cereal grain rice the only cereal grain grown in water is not the same as wild rice which is not even a rice it is however a grain not all seeds are grains quinoa and amaranth for example are not members of the grass family and thus are not grains but they behave as if they are by succumbing to cooking or popping buckwheat is neither wheat nor grain couscous an imposter it is pasta quinoa revered by the incas is pleasantly neutral in flavor when cooked its coiled center springs open amaranth used by the aztecs and teff from ethiopia are minute slightly sweet and exceptionally delicate but with a tiny caviarlike crunch amaranth is almost malted teff tastes of hazelnut and each is stickier than quinoa with no space to waste these little beads are the most nutrient dense of all kamut an ancient relative of modern durum wheat originally from egypt is a brawny frankly chewy grain with a sweet wheaty flavor with their protective armor of bran a grain 's outer coating and inner compartment or germ the heart of the grain and its reproductive package all whole grains are nutritional powerhouses high in protein b vitamins and fiber the slower digestion this extra baggage demands makes for greater nutritional absorption and a better regulation of blood sugar if you are watching your carbohydrates refined grains like instant oatmeal and cream of wheat are the bad guys stripped of their outer layer in milling and divested of their germ they are left with a starchy endosperm and little to no nutritional value your local market or health food store probably carries many of these and i 've found the following mail order sources to be reliable barry farm enterprises in wapakoneta ohio wwwbarryfarmcom or 419 228 4640 and bob 's red mill natural foods in milwaukie ore 800 349 2173 or wwwbobsredmillcom with a bounty of loose grains on my counter and a shiver of trepidation i got out my saucepans all of the grains cooked in the time it takes to make a pot of steel cut oats and they were all delicious i was so smitten i wanted them together in one bowl a united nations of grains but stove space and practicality pre empted my largesse in the end i had two creamy grain bases corn grits and farina and any number of crunchy and chewy options to ply them with i had to cheat a little grits are not whole grain the corn having lost its hull but they do have a supple toothsomeness and tons of flavor farina whole wheat berries ground fine offers creamy satin beads the final recipes are roughly mesoamerican and far eastern in their orientation but there is no limit to captivating combinations and accouterments the diminutive supergrains all cook in 15 to 20 minutes and are happy to share a pot with one another some whole grains need to be rinsed quinoa barley kamut and anything else that looks dusty amaranth and teff are so small they would need a tea strainer or cheesecloth so i left them alone dry toasting is nice too these pilafs are sumptuous brunch affairs clearly not for weekday mornings it could be argued that their lavish accessories diminish their healthy profiles if you are inclined to reach for the stevia and soy milk be my guest i prefer my sunday mornings dotted with butter and sprinkled with a bit of luxury

 to the editor my main reaction to richard taruskin 's article on carl orff is one of sadness that once again a great deal of precious space has been wasted on academic overkill and though i happen to enjoy a bit of orff 's music on occasion i doubt he 's worth the column inches also annoying is the supposition that the music is somehow insidiously evil because of its beat and primal nature as i recall elvis was condemned for what he did with his hips jazz was once certain to send us to hell and assuredly rap will prove the downfall of western civilization thomas c white bogota nj

 after 13 years in mystic the taste of connecticut food festival is moving to the new waterfront park in nearby new london to take advantage of what is fast becoming recognized as the region 's prime site for waterfront events the 15 million park which was constructed in time for opsail 2000 the international tall ships festival will play host to about 30 restaurants in outdoor booths for three days starting on friday for the first time the festival will be against a backdrop of eight tall ships readings by 60 local and national authors and paintings by a variety of artists this weekend as taste of connecticut combines with the boats books brushes festival opsail in many ways set the standard for what we could do and where we could do it said richard m brown new london 's city manager we learned a lot about the services we have to provide how to pay attention to food and merchandising how to move people in and out expeditiously two years later those lessons have begun to pay off not only did the city prove that it could handle the huge crowds the parade of sails drew about 250000 people but it showed off a newly refurbished waterfront we know if it was n't for the waterfront park we would n't be having this type of event mr brown said the waterfront park makes us very attractive as a visiting spot for the tall ships and having the tall ships in new london makes us attractive as the host for taste of connecticut we 're looking to make the maximum use of the waterfront and one of the things that always seems to draw people is food suzanne myler of daniels productions in west hartford which promotes taste of connecticut said the larger site in new london enabled the food festival to double in size in terms of the number of booths and that more visitors can be accommodated mystic could accommodate 50000 or 60000 people tops and we 're hoping that by combining the two festivals we 'll do better than that this year ms myler said there 's no question that it 's a great location it will offer a little bit of everything in addition to staples like chowder and pizza taste of connecticut will offer specialties like chocolate suicide truffle from armen 's gourmet endings in marlborough which has won best dessert at the festival several times and the popular garlic chicken on a stick from thai taste in new haven i think we 'll have a lot more people turn out than we would if both events were held separately said nancy tyler a spokeswoman for boats books and brushes though the event drew fewer than 10000 people last year it came right after the sept 11 terrorist attacks which many believe affected attendance since its inception taste of connecticut has been the premier fund raising event of the year for the mystic community center a recreational facility that started the festival as a two day event in 1989 and drew 12000 people since the first year the festival has served about 435000 portions of food to an estimated 250000 people karen a quinn executive director of the mystic community center said the festival has raised 75000 to 85000 annually for the center 's programs she added that the event had been limited for several years by the size of the park where has been held new london has really become the focus of our region ms quinn said they 've spent a lot of money upgrading the waterfront and there is a lot of room to grow there mystic is still wonderful but this has become such a huge event we need the space the opportunity to combine with an event like boats books and brushes really made it something we could n't pass up a larger site means that newer restaurants in the region will have access to taste of connecticut she said including the michael jordan steakhouse from the mohegan sun casino which will offer garlic bread and ribs and cascades at the new london holiday inn whose menu will feature tropicana dreamsicle cheesecake linnea lindstrom executive director of the mystic chamber of commerce said that as taste of connecticut grew larger it also found itself at odds with the residential neighborhood around its location we 're very sorry to see it leave ms lindstrom said it was a signature event for mystic it 's sad to see after so many years and being such a success that it 's leaving for new london but at the same time it really became a victim of its own success i think it will have a lot more breathing room now i think this is a real positive move for the community center although new london will receive 20000 for the use of the pier some locals are not pleased with the arrangement mayor lloyd beachy of new london said some people are upset that local restaurateurs were not given preference in their booth locations mr beachy added that others were upset that the festival will still benefit the mystic community center we 're doing all this for the first time so we learn as we go through the process mr beachy said we 're getting to the point where we had to address how we re going to use the park the park is becoming too big and too popular to just let things happen organizers hope that the combination of something to do and something to eat will prove too popular to resist but some vendors think the organizers are tampering with what has been for years a recipe for success in the past we 'll try it in the new location and then we 'll have to assess how it 's been on sales said robert homiski who with his wife armen owns armen 's gourmet endings it 's been a very good event for us for a lot of years we 'll have to wait and see if it 's the same in new london maurice m beebe owner of the north end deli in groton has participated for the last seven years she said the price for a booth had gone from 500 to 750 after the first year if it was gangbusters and we all made a lot of money mr beebe said i could see raising the price but to do it in the first year i think was a little premature but i 'm still very optimistic this has always been

 the first time i tried to order an alberto no 1 at la caravelle alberto would n't let me i was sitting at the small bar in the back room where adalberto alonso alberto for short has been bartender for 38 years not a bad tenure considering the restaurant just celebrated its 40th birthday after two glasses of champagne i asked if he had a house specialty he described the ingredients vodka champagne lime juice sugar and mint leaves then politely suggested that even though i had already consumed several pounds of bar nuts it might put me over the top fortunately my girlfriend arrived i ordered her one immediately and guzzled as much of it as she would allow you can not drink two of them mr alonso says as a rule of his deceptively light concoction the trouble is you desperately want to the vodka cuts the sugar and makes a clean delivery system for the mint and lime imagine a mojito but drier and with an elegant uptown fizz mr alonso who is 62 came to the united states from cuba when he was 17 his first job was at l'aiglon across the street from the st regis before moving to la caravelle he invented the no 1 about 30 years ago and quit while he was ahead there is no no 2 a new york adaptation of the mojito the cuban national cocktail it has the same base of lime sugar and crushed mint leaves but instead of rum it is shaken with vodka and topped with dry champagne it has a new york price too 12 the shaking is something to see not an insubstantial man mr alonso almost fills the small space behind the bar but when he brings the shaker to ear level and moves it rhythmically behind his head he suddenly takes on the lithe grace of a mambo king the no 1 is then poured into in an hourglass shaped goblet i associate with that other great pre castro cocktail the daiquiri sipping it i imagined myself at el floridita regaling papa hemingway with tales of the marlin that got away but was brought back to reality by the sight of michael douglas there he was in a french blue shirt unbuttoned to perfection inspecting an empty banquet table by the bar making sure all was in order for some big birthday party for some reason i was not invited on my next visit to observe more closely mr alonso 's ministrations andre jammet who owns la caravelle with his wife rita came over brandishing what looked like an enormous burgundy glass he asked if i would prefer to sip from this more elegant vessel i declined on the ground that it would mean either too much glass or too much drink there were three of us and we were thirsty in lieu of a second round mr alonso topped up our glasses with champagne by this time one of my dates was calling the drink alberto vo5 because it has the same hold mr alonso told us that he has an identical twin brother jorge who is the bartender at anche vivolo on 58th street you see him you see me he said i tried to imagine the confusion this must have caused in the old days back when jorge worked at le pavillon across the street where michael 's is now i pictured all those larry tate types on fat expense accounts taking their secretaries to this gold coast block and seeing the same face behind two different bars more than one no 1 and you 'll be seeing double without even leaving your stool alberto no 1 adapted from adalberto alonso la caravelle time 5 minutes juice of 1 lime 2 ounces vodka 10 mint leaves rinsed 1 1 2 teaspoons extra fine bar sugar champagne mint sprig for garnish in a cocktail shaker combine lime juice and vodka add mint leaves and crush with a spoon add the sugar and a little ice shake vigorously and pour into a tall stemmed glass add champagne to fill garnish with a mint sprig if desired yield 1 drink
 due preparations for the plague by janette turner hospital 401 pp new york w w norton company 2495 in the late 1980 's arab terrorists hijack an airliner en route from paris to new york after making a stop in germany to release 22 children and to refuel they land at tikrit in iraq when their demands for the release from prison of others in their group are rejected the hijackers blow up the plane all the passengers die except for 10 who are placed in a sealed bunker filled with sarin gas protective clothing and masks will work for only 24 hours the hijacking in fact is a sting operation unscrupulously risky set in motion by american intelligence risk becomes lethal inevitability when the sting is stung in its turn by the arab double agent whom the americans had employed to lead the action using the form of a politico literary thriller janette turner hospital has attempted a metaphysical novel of evil in this case as in some of her previous work notably the mesmeric novel the last magician the subject is the nightmare of power due preparations for the plague the title and the frequent quotes from camus indicate the author 's larger intentions is a descent through dantean circles of governmental conspiracy and betrayal hospital can be a strong and visionary writer but she is no virgil even granting her the role she has chosen the wrong vehicle a skateboard for a trip through hell the political thriller however gnarled calls for an agile energy of maneuver and a sharp if subtle definition of plot and character practitioners like graham greene and john le carre at his less self indulgent were able to infuse a tremor of time and world out of joint into their dexterous twists and betrayals in due preparations there is more than a tremor an avalanche of galactic foreboding effaces the thriller 's need for ultimately patterned logic and is at the same time artificially crimped by it the story begins a dozen years after the hijacking when the children saved from the plane have formed a support group led by samantha who came upon a code name salamander in her search of censored official documents the group has begun to focus on its suspicions of a sting several among them samantha 's lover meet with fatal mishaps samantha recruits an initially reluctant lowell whose mother perished on the flight she was leaving her husband for a jewish violinist also a victim the husband lowell 's father was a former high ranking cia operative he has just died in a car crash following an apparent heart attack his identity as salamander takes gradual fuzzy shape and it also turns out that he had given an airport locker key to his psychiatrist with instructions to turn it over to lowell after much hesitating lowell opens the locker and retrieves some notebooks and audiotapes their contents tell much of the rest of the story in a retrospect so fractured and swiveling that the reader puts as much effort into figuring out what hospital is up to as into following what happens her convolutions supply almost as much mystery as the plot itself they also account for a large part of the book 's paranoid atmosphere blindfolded as it were we hear not only noises but silences we take for noises from the tapes and from other accounts we learn of betrayals betrayed and of the sinister connections that maneuvered certain selected victims onto the passenger list of that ill fated flight salamander had been in charge of designing the trap using a saudi agent code named sirocco to set up the hijacking another intelligence official denouncing the plan is not only overruled but eliminated later that is to say earlier in the book 's vertigo of sequence salamander makes a last minute effort to have his wife postpone her trip this follows a tense confrontation with sirocco sleek and murderous in a paris restaurant an agent whom salamander infiltrated into his own entourage big spies have little spies on their backs to stab them and little spies littler spies etc had warned that the plan would be hijacked along with the plane sirocco whose real masters are saudis connected bin laden like to the royal family is following the instructions that the americans many jewish must die he scorns salamander 's threat to expose him to the police he has arranged for salamander 's french daughter by a mistress to be on the flight and he will warn her not to board only if matters are allowed to take their course this is a well contrived scene in a ludicrously inflamed scenario another is a teasingly complex tangle where two former lovers one american and one french are reunited by a series of phony double messages that end up getting both of them aboard the hijacked flight it 's a puzzle that succeeds hard to work out but absorbing and despite the result oddly playful other twists and turns could as well be jobbed in from the whole range of spy thriller literature and arranged any which way the major characters samantha lowell and salamander are drawn in terms only of their extravagant plights without other rounding or nuance they serve to racket the plot along even more they serve to declare the existential anguish that the plot aims to nourish much of this anguish is in the voice of lowell 's father on the tapes reaching a pitch of near madness including sporadic efforts to present salamander as someone other than himself at one point he delivers a ranting speech to cia recruits conjuring them up as helots who must do dreadful things on behalf of a higher duty and comparing them among other extravagances to shadrach meshach and abednego who enter the fiery furnace at god 's command we make firestorms from air and we walk through the fire unharmed we are zeus of the thunderbolts an even higher pitch is reached in the climactic scene with the 10 hostages in the bunker facing death when their protective gear fails a yiddish writer does a hasidic dance a philosopher delivers a wry deconstructive analysis two lovers embrace a diva sings orlando gibbons 's setting the silver swan who living had no note when death approached unlocked her silent throat it should be a moving triumphant pageant humanity refusing to be dehumanized by power 's purposes the government 's or the terrorists' staginess swamps it throughout the contrivances of the thriller have been shoved askew by symbolic purpose now the culminating symbol is marred by contrivance 's shadows richard eder writes book reviews and articles for the times
 you do n't have to be familiar with the convoluted pop mythology behind the japanese anime film blood the last vampire to appreciate some aspects of a movie that seems destined for cult status anyone who desires to explore its world which is really a genre within a genre is advised to do a little homework but to an uninitiated film critic what 's most intriguing about the movie is n't its story but its digitally animated visual language which is determined more by technology than by content as deployed by the creators of blood the last vampire hiroyuki kitakubo directed from a concept by mamoru oshii digital animation is an extremely linear style that renders inanimate objects especially machines of all kinds with an astonishing precision the movie fetishizes its own technological prowess by lingering over images like jet planes moving behind chain fences that emphasize the mathematical minutiae of the digital universe at the same time the style tends to turn people into machines no matter how clearly drawn the characters may be once they start moving they turn into toylike figures proceeding in digital increments this brooding horror movie set in 1966 at the yakota air force base an american military compound in japan presents some of the most visually detailed characters ever seen in an animated film not aspiring to photo realism how detailed in the movie 's press kit one american filmmaker is quoted as comparing them to the figures in francis bacon paintings that statement may be wildly hyperbolic but the movie does sustain an ominous shadowy mood that is vaguely bacon like the craggy comic book line drawings of katsuya terada who designed the characters imagine a human population of icy technocrats with matching voices these figures are every bit as scary in their way as the league of vampires also known as chiropterans who have infiltrated the air force base these shape shifting monsters have the ability to assume human form and mingle in human society undetected they can also fly because the story is set on halloween the distinction between revelers dressed as vampires and the real thing becomes all the more tenuous the monsters nemesis saya youki kudoh is a grim unsmiling young woman of mysterious origin who wields a magic sword as she cuts a gory swath through much of the movie saya is accompanied by the terrified doctor saemi nakamura from the infirmary of the american school on the base all hell breaks loose after saya strides into the infirmary and attacks two vampires posing as students under treatment for anemia for my taste blood the last vampire which opens today at the village east is much more effective at evoking a paranoid mood than at telling a coherent story and the jerky action sequences are among the film 's weaker visual elements but then i have n't been immersed in the movie 's pop mythology that mythology developed by mr oshii as a novel a film and a video game is deliberately enigmatic and inconclusive according to her creator saya is n't a conventional heroine but an angry loner who loathes humans as much as she hates the monsters if saya 's world is a deeply sullen one some may still want to get lost in it as for me i 'll take a pass blood the last vampire directed by hiroyuki kitakubo written in english with some subtitled japanese by kenji kamiyama based on a story by kazuo yamazaki and mitsuhiro tougou and the original characters by katsuya terada character design mr terada music by yoshihiro ike animation director kazuchika kise art director yusuke takeda produced by spe visual works sony computer entertainment ig plus and ipa released by manga entertainment at the village east second avenue at 12th street east village running time 85 minutes this film is not rated with the voices of youki kudoh saya saemi nakamura infirmary doctor and joe romersa david
 over nearly seven decades robert david lion gardiner the last heir to carry the name of one of long island 's original settler families spent untold amounts for the upkeep of sagtikos manor a historic house in west bay shore where washington slept first as the owner and since 1986 as the head of a nonprofit foundation dedicated to maintaining the rambling 42 room wood frame structure mr gardiner now 90 has said his unswerving purpose was to contribute to long island history the house listed on the national register of historic places in 1976 was opened to the public until recently as a museum but has been closed lately now as the foundation negotiates to sell the house and its 10 acre property to suffolk county for a price yet to be determined mr gardiner a multimillionaire is being politely but pointedly asked to make one last contribution all the house 's furnishings including paintings antique clocks tables chairs dishes and what may be the bed in which george washington spent a night during his tour of long island in 1790 whether the contribution is mr gardiner 's to make is in dispute but his willingness to make one last grand gesture may be needed to quell a potentially nasty legal fight alerted that as many as 63 items had been removed from the house and were to be auctioned off at christie 's in manhattan on friday the state attorney general 's office moved swiftly to block the sale the items had an estimated value of more than 1 million the state officials also headed off a sale by south bay auctions of east moriches news of the planned auctions whipped through bay shore there was disbelief said nancy donohue president of the sagtikos manor historical society mr gardiner has always been so interested in preserving the house and the furnishings his family has owned that house since 1758 denis j mcelligott the assistant attorney general in charge of the suffolk office said last week that his office believed furnishings in the house belonged to the foundation if they did he said the foundation 's tax exempt status meant it would need permission from the attorney general before divesting assets but joseph r attonito a lawyer for mr gardiner and a trustee of the foundation has maintained that the furnishings are the personal property of mr gardiner according to mr mcelligott mr attonito agreed to postpone the auction after the attorney general 's office threatened legal action against mr gardiner our suggestion is that mr gardiner realize that the furnishings were always assets of the not for profit foundation and therefore will be sold with the house mr mcelligott said mr attonito said no threat was needed he said mr gardiner and his wife eunice 73 had readily acquiesced to the state 's request for a postponement mr attonito said that he and the attorney general 's office were near an agreement on the disposition of the furnishings and the future of sagtikos manor itself he said he could not discuss details but said part of the settlement was that the personal furnishing would be returned to the house an array of islip town suffolk and state officials and local residents are aligned in a new group the committee to preserve sagtikos manor that is planning for the transition of the manor into a county owned historical site managed by a not for profit organization it 's a tremendous undertaking but it can be done said robert b mckay director of the society for the preservation of long island antiquities if the county acquires the house it would be one of their flagship properties preservationists are worried that the house is vulnerable and needs to be secured quickly last month the suffolk police arrested an antique dealer anthony pizzirusso of babylon near the manor 's entrance on montauk highway as he loaded an antique table into his car the police charged him with breaking into the house and removing antiques over several days they said the items were recovered the suffolk county legislature unanimously approved the purchase of the house in october the preservation of a house where our first president actually slept is really very significant said angie carpenter a republican county legislator from west islip who sponsored the bill for the county purchase i see this as the south shore 's answer to sagamore hill whether mr gardiner shared these sentiments could not be learned he has an unlisted telephone number in florida where he resides during the winter he and his wife also have a home in east hampton and the gardiner family has owned gardiners island the largest privately owned island on the east coast since the 17th century mr gardiner received sagtikos manor and 1200 surrounding acres stretching from great south bay nearly eight miles inland as a gift in 1933 from his aunt sarah diodati gardiner all but the 10 acres surrounding the mansion are now developed or part of a county park named for the gardiner family sagtikos manor was nearly a century old when washington slept there on april 21 1790 during his victory tour of long island to thank supporters of the american revolution legend has it that the owner a local magistrate named isaac thompson offered washington the best guest room in the house but that the president chose a smaller chamber that today remains much as it was then
 in an upbeat independence day column in the wall street journal peggy noonan the incurable optimist wrote about all the lights that did n't fail america from cops and firemen to peach growing farmers and cancer curing scientists from local churches to tv comedians to blogging blogging she explained the word as the 24 7 opinion sites that offer free speech at its straightest truest wildest most uncensored most thoughtful most strange thousands of independent information entrepreneurs are informing arguing adding information blog is a shortening of web log it is a web site belonging to some average but opinionated joe or josie who keeps what used to be called a commonplace book a collection of clippings musings and other things like journal entries that strike one 's fancy or titillate one 's curiosity what makes this online daybook different from the commonplace book is that this form of personal noodling or diary writing is on the internet with links that take the reader around

1982 in the toronto globe and mail as a lethal fanzine punch concocted more or less at random out of any available alcoholic beverages the first use i can find of the root of blog in its current sense

swell is swelled not swole however the linguistic scientist steven pinker pointed out that many southern us dialects preserve obsolete irregular verb forms like drag drug and help holp he noted that swell was once an irregular verb taking swole as its past tense which is preserved in its participle and adjective form swollen clinton 's usage therefore had some historical linguistic resonance and

 two years ago tomorrow a little after 10 at night cliff schaefer of oak ridge got a phone call that carried the worst possible news for him and the best possible news for a stranger named bonnye spino who lived in brick township that ringing telephone began a story that continues to unfold one that shows how grief and good fortune sometimes intermingle how resilient people can carry on after tragedy and yet not forget the phone call alerted mr schaefer that his only son james a 27 year old with a passion for things that move on two wheels had been severely injured in a motorcycle accident near blairstown it quickly became evident that james would not survive cliff schaefer had never given much thought to organ donations who does who expects his child to die young but remarkably in this numbing moment he broached the subject with doctors his simple explanation two years later it was my desire to more or less try to turn it around bonnye spino needed a gesture like that she was just 55 but a bad heart was killing her my chest just kept filling up with fluid and i kept going into heart failure she said and so the day after the accident james was taken off life support and dr mark b anderson surgical director of the heart transplant program at robert wood johnson hospital in new brunswick put the young man 's heart into ms spino probably about 30 percent of the people on the waiting lists in this country die on a yearly basis waiting for their hearts dr anderson said several intertwining threads let ms spino beat those odds one perversely was james 's love of cycles the accident occurred as he was breaking in a new harley davidson that was his dream to have this harley his stepmother karin schaefer said he bought it that morning at 10 and he died on it that night another was ms spino 's decision to switch her care from a philadelphia hospital to a new jersey one dr anderson said many new jersey doctors having trained in philadelphia or new york refer their transplant patients to large medical centers there even though waiting times for an organ can be shorter in new jersey where robert wood johnson and newark beth israel do heart transplants if an organ is harvested in this state it comes to us first he said we 're only competing against ourselves james 's heart made ms spino a new person as she put it but the physical improvement had an emotional price she is not the type to want to benefit from another 's misfortune when i first received the heart i had a very hard time accepting it because i knew it was a young person she said i would wake up in the night and cry the schaefers meanwhile were having their own struggles including the question that nags many donor families did our child 's heart go to a good person so about a year after the operation the schaefers and ms spino took a step that dr anderson said remains unusual in the transplant world they met and now they 're good friends when ms spino became a great grandmother in april the schaefers were at the christening this month they shared a few days at the shore and they have done promotional work on behalf of organ donations she 's lovely ms schaefer said of the woman who has her stepson 's heart we all get along so nicely and jimmy lives on the schaefers know that meeting the organ recipient might not be comfortable for every donor family but it was for them it just confirmed that we did the right thing ms schaefer said now at the two year mark everyone involved can take stock ms spino has used her gift of more time to enjoy her family to reach out to others in her situation and in general to savor each moment before i was very conservative she said now i push myself because i do n't want to miss out on anything and mr schaefer has used ms spino 's rejuvenation not to erase his loss but to help cope with it i could never replace my son and no one who i could ever be involved with through this thing could replace him he said but bonnye has been terrific her family 's terrific for me to be able to sit there and look at these people and realize that she 's had the opportunity to go on it does me a lot of good remembrance and rebuilding proceeding together a lesson with resonance as another two year anniversary approaches
 charging that a large shipment of plutonium from nuclear weapons may be on its way to permanent storage in his state rather than to the temporary stay needed for processing gov jim hodges has ordered the south carolina highway patrol to draw up plans for blocking the state 's borders to federal trucks bearing it mr hodges says the bush administration has reneged on a plan worked out by the clinton administration to move the plutonium out of the savannah river site near aiken sc after it is converted to power plant fuel or encased in glass without a guarantee that the radioactive material will eventually be moved out of the state he said in an interview today he will do whatever it takes to keep it from coming in i 'll stand squarely in front of the trucks if that 's what it takes to protect the health and safety of our people he said in the meantime we 've got a range of options including roadblocks we are not going to be stuck with permanent storage of plutonium in our state in a memorandum released by his office mr hodges ordered b boykin rose the state 's public safety director to evaluate options for highway roadblocks a step that recalls gov cecil d andrus 's use of the idaho state police in 1988 to block shipments of nuclear waste from the navy to a processing plant in his state mr hodges said a federal lawsuit was another option being considered the energy department which operates the savannah river site a nuclear processing and disposal complex said it hoped to continue discussing the issue with south carolina officials to prevent confrontations at the border joe davis a spokesman for the department said secretary of energy spencer abraham promised on a visit to the complex this week that the plutonium would not be permanently stored in south carolina we 're committed to making sure that the materials that come into the state leave the state mr davis quoted mr abraham as saying but mr hodges said that he was not satisfied with vague assurances and that he had not been given a detailed plan on how the waste will be removed if the government moves to south carolina all the plutonium that requires processing he said it will leave the state isolated because no other state will want the material back we will be left holding the proverbial bag the governor wrote in his memorandum the two sides can not even agree on when the first shipment of more than 50 tons of plutonium from rocky flats the shuttered colorado nuclear weapons complex will enter south carolina on its way to the savannah river site about 20 miles downstream from augusta ga mr hodges said he believed that the trucks would begin coming in two weeks but mr davis said there would be no shipments until this fall the plutonium at issue was left over from the production of nuclear weapons in 1996 the united states and russia agreed to take equal amounts out of their nuclear stockpiles and either convert it to fuel for nuclear power plants or encase it in radioactive glass to keep it from being stolen but in may citing budget pressures the bush administration said it would not yet begin the expensive process of stabilizing the plutonium and encasing it in glass instead officials said waste will be stored in containers at the south carolina complex while the issue is studied further that infuriated mr hodges who said the state had contributed enough to the nation 's nuclear program by allowing savannah river to manufacture plutonium and tritium gas for bombs as far back as 1952 the state has no intention of being the storage site for warhead waste he said suggesting that it be stored instead in a state with many remote locations like nevada the end of the cold war allowed the government to shut down the original five reactors at the 310 square mile savannah river complex and now the only plutonium manufactured there is used as batteries for space probes but the site still plays an important role in storing and processing spent fuel and other waste the cost of processing the plutonium has grown sharply however precisely at a time when the bush administration is looking for ways to cut the budget of most agencies including the energy department a confidential report from the department made public on thursday by the private nuclear control institute said the cost of the 22 year plutonium disposal program that resulted from the agreement with the russians had now risen to 66 billion a 50 percent increase over a 1999 estimate mr hodges a democrat said politics did not play a role in his stand and added that he did not believe his state was being made a target for waste because he is a democrat at a time when republicans are in the white house this afternoon in fact one of his most bitter political enemies state attorney general charlie condon a republican issued a strong statement of support for his position pledging to work with him to keep the government from forcing the state to accept nuclear waste
 mantegna mystery two telephone bidders at sotheby 's yesterday morning tried to buy descent into limbo the last painting by the italian renaissance master andrea mantegna that is still in private hands george wachter director of old master paintings for sotheby 's worldwide took the winning bid for 285 million just shy of the work 's 30 million high estimate the price includes sotheby 's new buyer 's premium 20 percent of the first 100000 and 12 percent of the rest estimates do not reflect commissions the second the hammer came down the speculation started some old master dealers swore the buyer was the j paul getty museum in los angeles but scott j schaefer formerly an old master painting expert for sotheby 's and now the getty 's paintings curator was sitting in the salesroom and said the museum did not even bid another theory was that the buyer was lord thomson of fleet the former owner of the times of london and one of the richest men in canada he paid 767 million a record for an old master painting at auction for rubens 's massacre of the innocents 1609 11 at sotheby 's in london in july and then promised the painting with nearly 2000 other works in his collection to the art gallery of ontario that theory made sense until several dealers near the telephones said that they thought they had heard mr wachter speaking italian all sotheby 's would say is that the buyer wished to remain anonymous it also declined to say who sold the painting although literature about the work lists the owner as barbara piasecka johnson an internationally known collector of old master paintings who moved from princeton nj to monaco several years ago she inherited about 300 million from her husband j seward johnson sr son of the founder of the johnson johnson pharmaceutical company who died in 1983 the painting which has been exhibited in the united states and abroad depicts jesus from the back leaning on his staff by the entry to a cave in a way that instantly draws in viewer and creates an air of mystery on his left are four figures including adam and eve and to the right is a man hunched toward him strong thread peter c marzio director of the museum of fine arts houston was braced for just the kind of response he received when he approached some of his museum colleagues to see who might be interested in showing the quilts of gee 's bend a show that was in houston in the fall and is now at the whitney museum of american art through march 9 when you mention a quilt show to people they roll their eyes mr marzio said so initially he was quite happy when the show was scheduled for new york and houston but its popularity from word of mouth and rave reviews suddenly made the show a hot commodity michael kimmelman chief art critic of the new york times called the quilts some of the most miraculous works of modern art america has produced now the quilts of gee 's bend chronicling the work of several generations of female quilters from the isolated historically black community of gee 's bend ala will travel to eight other museums during the next three years it will be on view at the mobile museum of art in alabama from june 14 to aug 31 the milwaukee art

norfolk va from oct 15 2004 to jan 2 2005 the memphis brooks museum of art from feb 12 through may 8 2005 the museum of fine arts boston from june through august 2005 and the high museum of art in atlanta from december 2005 through february 2006 the show could keep traveling mr marzio said it has become so popular that he had to turn down many requests several from museums that had originally turned him down once this tour is over the mfa will have done its part he said referring to the houston museum we may do another show but it will be of other quilts of equal quality fogg acquisitions

 yungchen lhamo coming home and lama gyurme with jean phillipe rykiel rain of blessings vajra chants real world unfamiliar faiths can be easier to accept when expressed in foreign tongues the chant based sacred music of tibet has helped stimulate american interest in both that country 's religion and in its struggle against chinese dominance new albums by the expatriates yungchen lamo and lama gyurme who share central park 's summerstage next thursday at 7 pm communicate tibetan wisdom and defiance within soothing new age electronica yungchen lhamo 's music is political as well as spiritual on coming home she spans artistic borders aided by the renowned producer hector zazou at times she sounds like sarah mclachlan or a hong kong pop star mr zazou 's settings for her high melancholy voice incorporate electric guitar violin cello and a sample of a tuvan throat singer yet whether singing in english or wordlessly shouting ms lhamo keeps her focus on the essentially tibetan themes of compassion and liberation lama gyurme is a monk and on his second collaboration with the french pianist jean philippe rykiel he focuses on vajra style devotional chanting mr rykiel surrounds mr gyurme 's appealingly homely voice with organ violin and keyboards creating a hymnlike tone less overtly political than ms lhamo mr gyurme still eloquently argues for the preservation of tibet in a form flexible enough to appeal to the west ann powers

 before you know it life just passed you up the man said you lose everything you lose your wife you lose your family you lose your friends but after seeing you go back and forth to jail over 10 15 20 years he added they just give up on you he was speaking of his personal war with heroin addiction a demon he had battled for decades and like the aging addicts described in a study appearing this month in the archives of general psychiatry the man in late middle age was intimately familiar with the addiction 's physical and social costs the study begun in the mid 1970 's by researchers at the university of california at los angeles followed male heroin addicts admitted to a court ordered drug treatment program in california in the early 1960 's the men were interviewed in 1974 and 1975 and again in the mid 1980 's the report presented the findings of a 33 year follow up carried out in 1996 and 1997 of the 581 men in the original study the researchers found 284 had died 216 percent from drug overdoses or from poisonings by adulterants added to the drug another 386 percent died from cancer or from heart or liver disease three died of aids homicides suicides or accidents killed 55 of them yet as disturbing as these numbers were the death rates were higher by several orders of magnitude than those for the general population the struggles of the men who were still living were equally troubling for example of the 242 subjects interviewed in the 33 year follow up at the time in their late 40 's to mid 60 's 405 percent reported using heroin within the last year and 207 percent tested positive for the drug in the urinalysis required for the study abuse of other illicit drugs was also frequent 194 percent had used cocaine in the last year 355 percent had used marijuana as was the use of nicotine and alcohol the striking thing for me is that a good proportion of this group continues using said dr yih ing hser an adjunct professor at ucla 's neuropsychiatric institute and the lead author of the study ordinarily she said you 'd think that when people are reaching old age that they can not continue to do the things they used to like hustling for drugs but that did n't happen among the men in the study who still used drugs health problems unemployment criminal involvement social isolation and broken family relationships were common as they were for a similar group of addicted men who took part in focus groups organized by the researchers some men in the study did manage to attain abstinence and the difference was striking when they came into the interview said dr christine grella also an adjunct professor at the neuropsychiatric institute and an author of the study they were well functioning and they looked good dr grella said those who continued to use did n't look good and they had many physical problems that were hard for them the study financed in part by the national institute on drug abuse found that even the men who achieved periods of abstinence were still vulnerable to relapse those who had abstained for at least five years were less likely to relapse but even in this group 25 percent resumed heroin use some after 15 years of abstinence and among those abstinent for more than five years many abused alcohol or other drugs the findings the researchers said make it clear that surmounting heroin addiction can be a long and circuitous process and that treatment programs need to take this into account most people think that those who go to treatment will be immediately cured she said but heroin is a difficult drug to kick and therefore treatment and recovery has to take incremental steps results from the 20 year follow up the researchers said showed that methadone maintenance therapy helped the men refrain from heroin use but only 10 percent of the subjects were enrolled in methadone maintenance in any given year many researchers believe that methadone maintenance therapy is an essential component of treatment but say that for a variety of reasons it is often not readily available to addicts many programs for example discontinue treatment if a client fails a drug test or can not meet the fee dr hser said that kind of barrier to treatment is partly responsible for the outcome we are seeing she said while several national studies have followed addicts over a period of years the ucla study is the first to track them over three decades

 playing conditions changed today at the byron nelson championship but the leader remained the same after the wind changed direction overnight but was still gusting to 20 miles an hour vijay singh found himself playing a tpc at las colinas golf course this afternoon that he hardly recognized it was harder to score it was harder to choose clubs it was harder to remain patient and it was enough to frustrate many players like tim petrovic who shot a four over par 74 and tumbled out of contention while playing in the final group with singh but singh relied on the experience that comes from playing around the world and winning 33 events including two majors with crisp ball striking and a superb up and down to save par at no 17 singh protected the one stroke lead he started the round with and entered sunday 's final round as the player to beat singh shot a 69 to finish the third round at 11 under par 199 one stroke ahead of jeff sluman who shot a 68 today cameron beckman and luke donald were two strokes back tied for third after shooting 67 's with 17 players no more than five shots behind the event remains wide open and singh was slightly disappointed that he did not widen his margin but he was still in the best position to win the tournament i 'm still in the lead which is an important thing said singh who already has one victory this year at the phoenix open they still have to worry about catching me he added you do n't want to lose a golf tournament on saturday i have been known to get impatient but i stuck to it and i 'm quite happy still leading it took a splendid up and down at the par 3 200 yard no 17 for singh to keep his one stroke edge with the pin back and to the left singh hit a 7 iron off the tee figuring there was no way he could hit the ball over the green but the wind fooled him the ball sailed over the green into rough so thick that when singh arrived at his ball he could hardly see it he had little green to work with and little idea how the ball would react coming out of deep grass singh deftly pitched the ball onto the green and watched it roll softly just 7 feet past the pin the gallery cheered and singh appreciated how good a shot it was i was just trying to get it inside 10 feet and i made a perfect shot he said maybe if i put another 10 balls there i would n't get inside there singh made the putt then he made par at no 18 and looked forward to being paired with sluman on sunday at age 45 sluman hopes to join other over 40 winners on the tour this year including fred couples and scott hoch with six career victories sluman is not likely to be intimidated asked about playing with singh sluman said obviously he is a major winner he has won all over the world he is a big strong guy that hits it a mile and he 's fearless out there but i ca n't worry about whoever i am paired with that goes back to being more of a veteran player than a young guy if i was 24 or 25 i would be probably wondering how he thinks i am going to play is he going to be looking at my swing i wonder how he thinks i am swinging he could care less that 's not saying anything bad that 's reality you have to concentrate on your own game singh has concentrated on his game despite distractions last sunday he voiced opposition to annika sorenstam 's decision to compete on the pga tour next week saying in part she does n't belong out here it was a position that resulted in heavy criticism but with singh the golf course is a place of refuge he is a tireless worker known for spending hours at the range and at age 40 his practice routine has hardly slowed i do n't have too many other things to do he said i have a family but if i have a week off i take two days off and then what you have to prepare i have not lost the desire to practice nor has singh lost the desire to win and he will enter the final round in position to do it again woods is struggling alveslohe germany may 17 ap tiger woods had another poor putting day at the deutsche bank sap open today leaving him with little hope of catching the leader padraig harrington woods shot a two under par 70 and was at six under 210 through three rounds nine strokes behind harrington 201 who led by two strokes over graeme mcdowell harrington also led after the second round

 earlier this fall i was on a flight to los angeles that made a few extra turns after takeoff once we reached cruising altitude the pilot made a long announcement explaining that his computer had been indicating a problem with the hydraulic brake system and that after running some tests he had decided it was ok that the problem was caused by a computer anomaly not the brakes so instead of returning to jfk we were cleared to fly on but then mr pilot added brightly i looked up and noticed we were ascending into the flight path of another plane so i dipped down to avoid it that was the second unusual movement you may have noticed actually no one had noticed from what i could tell though i was alarmed to hear about it why was our pilot telling us about questionable brakes and a computer on the fritz when we still had a landing to worry about five hours ahead clearly he was giving us way too much information he was guilty of overshare overshare is n't just a noun it 's also an accusation a way of calling foul in a culture in which people do n't know how to put the brakes on it 's carnie wilson in us weekly discussing the stomach and intestinal surgery that cut her weight by 150 pounds adding that after having her tummy tucked and boobs lifted she 's going to have sex all the time it 's unsolicited lectures from friends on colonics it 's a kid at the yankees parade holding up an i skipped school sign for a photographer overshare is woody harrelson talking about his tantric sex habits bob dole on erectile dysfunction jay leno questioning al gore about a rolling stone cover deemed too sexy and jim carrey telling details magazine that he could have a tumor on the side of my head and people would still be jealous it 's kathleen turner nude in the graduate in london and anything about the vagina monologues people are sharing without consideration of who they 're sharing with and whether or not they want to hear it said gordon wheeler a psychologist and the author of beyond individualism published this year by the analytic press ultimately i 'm not sure that real honesty is about telling the truth all the time it might be more of a way of unburdening yourself how did this happen was it the share your feelings ethos of the 1960 's the joy of sex woody allen jane fonda egging people into spandex calvin klein pushing male narcissism is it all a result of our tabloid culture or the fact that we constantly have to listen to strangers spill intimacies into cell phones should we blame reality television for empowering anybody at all to blubber and vent on camera and even if we are amused by sex and the city in which no act is taboo for discussion is n't it a textbook case of overshare extraordinaire some people benefit from oversharing when diana the princess of wales declared that there were three people in her marriage she was embraced for this indiscretion on the other hand i know liberal female hillary doubters who would trust her more if she had n't kept such a stiff upper lip during the white house sex scandal society is commonly too cheap henry david thoreau wrote it 's hard to disagree especially when paula jones increases her fame by posing for penthouse and a silly revue called naked boys singing which consists of just that is so popular that it 's being replicated in cities across the country even as we are bludgeoned with all this instances of dignity emerge the full monty on broadway for instance uses stripping to impart a lesson about personal exposure by way of some hard luck guys who flaunt their bodies because they have to not because they want to but ultimately the show charms because instead of sharing too much it keeps the brakes on instead of unburdening himself of his travails our pilot on that loopy flight should have kept his brakes on too at least the hydraulic brakes worked when we landed
 most people do not go to a party with thoughts of working but that is exactly what most of the 600 greater hartford jaycees do for more than seven days each june they are preparing the tournament players club at river highlands in cromwell for the canon greater hartford open professional golf tournament the professional golf association tournament starts on thursday but pre tournament events begin tomorrow these volunteers arrive at the golf course in the weeks leading up to the tournament for work parties as these sessions are called to put up fences organize the scoring system set up luxurious corporate sky boxes by putting up tents arrange and unpack furniture put oak paneled walls in place operate forklifts and attend to the many details of putting on a professional sporting event during the seven days of the tournament 2500 volunteers will work the event adding up to 4000 volunteer hours they will take care of the 35000 spectators who attend each day by working crowd control and handling parking and ticket taking duties but most of the organizational and set up work must be completed two weeks before the event begins during the seven work parties which last anywhere from three hours to all day the large warehouse on the club property that stores equipment such as the tables chairs the leader board and fencing was bustling with activity during one such work party on a hot sunday morning in june janet grace an underwriter for an insurance company and a member of the jaycees has been offering her services at the tournament for 18 years she coordinates the training and scheduling of volunteers the atmosphere here is always upbeat and energetic ms grace said as she unpacked equipment in the warehouse and i have made some of my closest friendships from the people i 've met here she said it is rewarding work you know that you 're helping to raise a lot of money for some really worthy causes terri sultar who sets up and runs the scoring system which among other things involves making sure they have the names of all the golfers in the tournament on scoring sheets and for the leader board said being a jaycee has another advantage after helping to run the gho she said you 're ready to step right into boards and other leadership position in other volunteer organizations like many volunteers cindy skiff in charge of selling setting up and running the corporate sky boxes uses vacation days seven this year from her sales and marketing job to work whole days before and during the tournament some of her duties also include recruiting volunteers who will serve as bartenders tent captains couriers and delivery crew since she will be working all seven days of the tournament ms skiff will in effect be donating more than 14 days worth of work to the tournament that translates into a significant financial contribution to the greater hartford open and the jaycees most of us on the executive committee use on average seven or eight of our vacation days during the june crunch time ms skiff said we just really enjoy the spirit of cooperation that fuels this event the jaycees are a national young persons volunteer community service organization whose mission is to develop leadership skills and raise money for community improvement programs such as scholarships for high school seniors in the greater hartford area and grants to the children 's fund members must be between 18 and 39 years old when they turn 40 members are aged out of the organization as the members put it but they can still volunteer to work during the tournament the greater hartford open has become the largest fund raising event for the jaycees who own the tournament and annually profit more than 600000 from playing host the detailed logistics of putting on such a sporting event usually require many full time professional staffers but the open is managed almost completely by jaycee volunteers each year a new tournament chairman or woman is selected by the organization 's management committee and that person oversees the 22 member executive committee which sets up and runs the tournament patrick mcnickle 33 is one of the tournament

 jazz has bumped up against a lot of different kinds of music in the last 40 years almost immediately creating new genres on contact but one area that seems surprisingly cordoned off from it is electro acoustic improvisation the fairly new fully abstract music that tends to include one musician busily writing code and generating sounds on a laptop computer it 's still a small movement so if you 're a jazz musician and you achieve this fusion few will recognize the significance the most and best laptop music has come from europe and japan leaving a confusing question as to whether jazz musicians in the united states waist deep in an american idiom can or should put their own stamp on it improvisers in the electronic world shoulder plenty of modernity issues making jazz as we know it barely relevant to them so true electro acoustic jazz is n't just going to sprout naturally a few powerful vectors are needed and though they have begun to appear in japan and chicago new york has been lagging behind on the strength of a magnificent performance on thursday night at tonic the trumpeter dave douglas seems like the first jazz musician in new york who 's trying to integrate jazz played on a high level and it is unmistakably jazz with electronic improvisation his set part of a triple bill at tonic that benefited the red cross disaster relief fund drew from a new book of music written for a new band witness the themes he played are also found on his new album witness bluebird rca but in the performance he pared down the arrangements from a wild 11 piece miscellany to a hard driving sextet chris potter was a substitute on tenor saxophone sharing the front line melodies with mr douglas often ebb tide and lyrical all the pieces on witness are dedications to writers and activists who have made nonviolent responses to repressive or abusive political regimes from edward said to the egyptian novelist naguib mahfouz to the bangladeshi poet taslima nasrin melancholy was an ingredient but the music had many dimensions snapping effectively between sections spending as much time in syncopated rhythm as free improvisation there were only two breaks for applause in 90 minutes and around the composed material mr douglas kept the improvised combinations volatile the band members who also included ikue mori on laptop computer jamie saft on a distorted electric piano brad jones on bass and michael sarin on drums all shared solo time producing a real breadth of sensibility everyone was heard and always seemingly for a reason ms mori 's contributions sounds that never had real world referents but could approach bouncing marbles crinkling paper brushed bells records run backwards were loud constantly changing and furtively initiated with her at one extreme and mr potter 's learned harmonically and rhythmically complex jazz language at the other the results could have been a mess of mutually exclusive languages the set was not only coherent but full bodied and confident which felt like victory
 strong roles for women are a staple of ballet and three dancers took advantage of that in la bayadere and antony tudor 's offenbach in the underworld presented by american ballet theater at the metropolitan opera house la bayadere is a gorgeous 19th century war horse of a ballet laced with dollops of pure classical dancing it was performed in a resolutely large scale and traditional way on tuesday night but paloma herrera who danced the doomed young temple dancer nikiya gave that heroine 's fragile indomitability a slightly modern twist evident in her supple expressive torso and her touch of anger in first act scenes her delicately held arabesques in the second act were a special pleasure michele wiles stole the dramatic honors however in a glittering performance of the villainous gamzatti ms wiles did betray the smiling exultancy of a 21st century american ballerina in a splendidly danced variation in the second act but it was an understandable lapse jose manuel carreno was something of a bounder as solor the fickle warrior but he devoted most of his energy to the pyrotechnics of the second act danced with a surging stallion power brian reeder 's imposing high brahmin matched that power in a nicely restrained performance monique meunier made her official company debut in new york on may 8 in offenbach in the underworld ms meunier a new york city ballet dancer who later joined ballet theater but was sidelined by an injury was a deliciously ripe and knowing queen of the carriage trade her expansive performance drew attention to this relatively minor character with just the right insouciant shrug
 to the editor arguing against billboards based on their relative ugliness is to paraphrase the ad man howard gossage like saying mice should be kept out of the kitchen because they do n't match the formica the fact is that what billboard advertisers are selling does n't belong to them our attention we ca n't turn the page change the channel or tune them out walking around broadway and houston is like being trapped inside an issue of details naomi klein a toronto journalist you quoted may be right in saying that many people love new york for the spectacle of over the top commercialism there are however quite a few of us actually living here who disagree carrie mclaren park slope brooklyn

 to the editor there can be no doubt that the family members and loved ones of those killed on sept 11 have suffered greatly and will continue to do so for many years they deserve our sympathy and assistance but there is something unseemly about the machinations behind the victims compensation fund news article march 8 by guaranteeing victims families such huge sums the federal government is complicit in devaluing the deaths of other people families whose breadwinners are incapacitated by disabilities or terminal illnesses continue to suffer financially and emotionally and they can expect little or no help from government agencies instead of engendering continued good will from americans who broadly accept a reasonable level of government compensation the administration risks kindling resentment over deaths deemed somehow more special than others jeff hoover brooklyn march 8 2002
 after president clinton 's motorcade swept out of the gates of vietnam national university here on friday an impromptu teach in began on the steps of the lecture hall as american reporters quizzed vietnamese students about their reaction to mr clinton 's speech more than once the students deftly turned the tables questioning the visitors about their country tell me about your system of higher education said anh le 20 an english student whose unflinching gaze suggested she would not accept a token response i have to give a presentation to my class the two reporters speaking to her shifted from foot to foot offering some thoughts about the number of foreign students on scholarships and trying to evoke the atmosphere of an american campus how can we go to these places she asked mobility is not the same in vietnam as it is in the united states her comments said much about the lure of the united states for young vietnamese but in the soft evening air there were hard reminders that vietnam remains a closed society unnecessary chaperones whenever the exchanges grew animated well dressed men with wide smiles sauntered over and offered to translate since the students spoke english the offers were gratuitous but they were enough to shut down one young woman who had seemed eager to discuss mr clinton 's remarks about civil liberties not everyone needed an official from the interior ministry to act as a chaperone nguyen hoang lien 26 an environmental science student dismissed the president 's comments on political freedom as irrelevant since the 1930 's we have had only one political party in this country she said matter of factly all vietnamese agree with this bill clinton rock star pick up any local newspaper here and one would conclude that mr clinton 's visit is groundbreaking a landmark and any other word that means really important but one would have no clue that mr clinton is being treated like a rock star by people in the streets most papers have covered only the formal meetings between the president and senior vietnamese officials while a few reported on mr clinton 's speech at vietnam national university they quoted sparingly from it and carried no reaction from students or anyone else who heard it two tabloids did offer a glimpse of mr clinton 's charm offensive they ran a picture of him standing on a balcony stretching to clasp the hands of delighted children in the house next door reporters at the vietnam news the english language daily said there was no suspense about how their editors would play the trip visiting heads of state are memorialized on the top left hand side of the front page the article is always accompanied by a picture of the vip with vietnam 's president on friday true to form the newspaper featured an article in that space under the headline us president 's visit hailed as new landmark in bilateral ties the photograph showed mr clinton and the vietnamese president tran duc luong reviewing an honor guard at the presidential palace the last head of state to get such play was from luxembourg and the first lady hillary rodham clinton 's foreign trips have something of a routine and today as she has in more than 20 countries the first lady was host to a forum of women who are leaders here aides to mrs clinton say these events are hit or miss for every stimulating discussion there is a stilted encounter today probably rated as a miss despite a formidable lineup of business people educators and government officials the discussion never got off the ground instead the panelists read long statements many of which simply affirmed that equality of the sexes is enshrined in vietnam 's constitution after listening for more than an hour mrs clinton looked like a senator sitting through a filibuster let me thank the panelists for a thorough discussion of the issues she said with noticeable exasperation mrs clinton took mild issue with the assertion that women have equal rights in vietnam merely because equality is guaranteed in the constitution but she seemed eager to explore the role that women play in the vietnamese economy and society which is greater than in many countries what is different is there is a history of women working alongside men fighting alongside men mrs clinton said diplomatic chuckle at one point during his travels president clinton chatted with a reporter about warren m christopher his former secretary of state who opened diplomatic relations with vietnam on a trip to the country in 1995 i bet chris wishes he was back here right now mr clinton said with a chuckle mr christopher of course is in a quagmire halfway around the world leading vice president al gore 's battle to determine who won the state of florida and the right to succeed mr clinton
 president bush has instructed the team that will negotiate with north korea that the united states will not settle for another freeze on the country 's nuclear program instead senior administration officials said today washington will insist that the north dismantle both of its major nuclear weapons projects as part of any larger bargain with the united states in interviews today the officials said they had relatively low expectations for the first round of talks scheduled to take place next week in beijing the talks which some american officials fear could be delayed now that news of them has become public would be the first between the two countries in more than six months mr bush approved the overall plan for the negotiating strategy at a meeting tuesday with secretary of state colin l powell the officials said he told mr powell that he was not ready to discuss any kind of treaties with the north something the country has demanded until the nuclear threat is dismantled american officials said however that they were seeking new and creative ways to assure the north koreans that we are not looking to overthrow them to take them out a senior official said mr bush has issued several such assurances in recent months but american officials believe the iraq war may have prompted fears in the north korean leadership that they are next as mr bush addresses threats today in his first public comments on the talks mr powell said that the united states was placing no conditions on the negotiations and he told the associated press that the north would have an opportunity to present their positions to come into this trilateral meeting and speak candidly in front of the united states and the chinese it was china 's intervention that created the compromise leading to the negotiations north korea had insisted on direct talks with washington but mr bush had insisted on broad talks involving china japan south korea and russia administration officials said the initial talks would involve only the united states north korea and china but a state department spokesman philip t reeker said today that the united states hopes to expand the talks in later rounds we are looking for the early inclusion of japan and south korea he said privately south korean officials have told the united states that they would not agree to any financial commitments to the north that were made when they were not participating in the negotiations when american officials first confronted north korea with evidence that it was cheating on a 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons program several officials said no talks could take place before the north began dismantling its facilities but in recent months they have backed away from that precondition and next week 's talks if they go forward as scheduled will occur with the north proceeding with two separate programs that could produce weapons within months or years there 's an outward calm people are trying to project about this one senior intelligence official said but the fact of the matter is that if these talks do n't work out we would be faced with a north korea with six or eight nukes pretty soon rather than two possible weapons now one senior administration official said today that it now appears that north korea 's leaders decided as early as 1995 to attempt a clandestine program to produce weapons from highly enriched uranium over the next few years north korea secretly gathered technology from pakistan and other nations at the core of mr bush 's concern now his aides say is a fear that the united states may never be able to verify that the north has given up all of its nuclear projects even if a deal can be reached the main plutonium production plant at yongbyon is relatively easily monitored officials say but american officials are uncertain where the uranium project is or whether there is more than one mr bush has often discussed his distrust of kim jong il the north korean leader a man he has said he detests for starving his own people today the united nations commission on human rights overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning the north for all pervasive and severe restrictions on the freedoms of thought religion opinion expression assembly and association and for torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment of its citizens including imposition of the death penalty for political reasons with saddam hussein disposed of some administration officials who did not want to deal with north korea for fear of distracting attention from iraq are beginning to focus anew on the country that could place pressure on mr powell and his assistant secretary for east asia james a kelly to show that the negotiations are making progress but mr powell said today that he expected this is a beginning of a long intense process of discussion
 what were we doing here we were sitting on hard wooden chairs at tables covered in brown paper at a restaurant that did n't take reservations or credit cards was situated behind a bakery and where patrons had to go next door to use the restrooms what were we doing we were enjoying one of the best meals of the year this was not just any casual cafe but the panini cafe at diane 's in roslyn that is diane as in trattoria diane one of the island 's top restaurants the food at the new spot comes from that same exalted kitchen indeed john durkin the chef owner made frequent forays into our cozy quarters bringing free tidbits for diners to try a crisp wafer thin smoked mozzarella pizza one night triangles of crisply fried mozzarella sandwiches another warm doughnut holes rolled in cinnamon sugar or tiny samples of fudgy brownies with a mini scoop of banana ice cream at the end of the meal the panini cafe is very casual at breakfast and lunch with counter service only patrons order a crisp panino pizza or pasta or choose from an array of salads sold by the pound at dessert time they wander into the bakery at the front of the building and choose a brownie or other goodie to take back to their table at night the lights are lowered votive candles add a bit of atmosphere and there is waitress service the staff members are sweet and professional they aim to please if diners prefer they can order from the trattoria diane menu the space is simple yet pleasant made even more so by shiny buckets filled with daisies but the panini cafe is not about superior servers or charming surroundings it 's about tip top food at rock bottom prices the highest priced menu item is baby lamb chops at 16 most of the food is casual fare panini at 8 bruschetta 6 to 8 salads 6 to 9 and pastas 10 to 12 additional casual offerings like a cheese plate and prosciutto with fresh figs are available they call out for a glass of wine and there are 15 offered by the glass a list of 75 bottles from next door is brought on request begin the meal with bruschetta i thought the traditional version four grilled slices of bread with chopped tomatoes and basil was super then i tasted the even better rendition with fava beans a ragout of wild mushrooms was another stellar possibility as was a marriage of prosciutto fig jam and gorgonzola which revealed a tasty counterpoint of sweet and salty salads also made a good showing especially the mound of arugula over prosciutto surrounded by roasted figs with melted gorgonzola caps the seafood salad was a dream come true big chunks of lobster firm shrimp mussels quartered sea scallops and exceptionally tender calamari rings all blessed with a perky lemon vinaigrette at entree time spring for the 16 lamb chops seven tiny lollipop chops with long white bones that want to be picked up the tasty juicy chops best evers in my book arrived with a small clump of arugula salad and a balsamic dipping sauce one evening the special was roast chicken over mashed potatoes and spinach 15 it was an exemplary bird with crisp herb flecked skin and juicy meat the large generous panini grill pressed sandwiches with about a half dozen savory fillings were also worthy possibilities included tempting combinations like goat cheese and caponata and chicken arugula tomato and asiago cheese do n't miss the spaghettini in a fresh tasting tomato sauce it was a classic done well convince a friend to order the tiny veal meatballs in a lush tomato veal sauce the flavorful marble size morsels were satisfying by themselves augmented only by diane 's great bread other pastas that should not be overlooked are the lasagne with spinach shiitakes goat cheese and tomato basil sauce and the lasagne bolognese with its crunchy top layer just as the meal began with the same bread basket as next door addictive cheese crisps foccacia and slices of chewy bread it ended with the dessert list from trattoria diane all 8 my old favorite the three berry

 a general strike in venezuela the fourth largest exporter of oil to the united states has contributed to a rise in oil prices in the last month but the strike which began on dec 2 and has resulted in a drastic decline in the country 's oil production was not initiated by left wing labor unions as many americans may think in fact it was instigated by venezuela 's wealthy business elite underlying this crisis lies a central paradox of globalization and of united states foreign policy the combination of laissez faire capitalism and free elections can create political and economic instability venezuela is only the most recent illustration president hugo chavez was democratically elected in 1998 in a landslide victory a result reconfirmed in a vote in 2000 since taking office however mr chavez has presided over an increasingly chaotic economy a chaos not always though sometimes of his own making the strikes currently crippling venezuela 's economy for example are largely the work of business interests that are intensely opposed to mr chavez because of his threats of nationalization and his attempts to seize control of the oil sector there is also an ethnic dimension to venezuela 's crisis along with roughly 80 percent of venezuela 's population mr chavez is a pardo a term with both class and ethnic overtones that refers loosely to brown skinned people of amerindian or african ancestry but venezuela 's economy has always been controlled by a tiny minority of cosmopolitan whites or mantuanos the venezuelan term for persons with european features and pretensions not surprisingly foreign investors deal almost exclusively with members of the well educated english speaking mantuano class venezuela 's problems are part of a much larger global phenomenon pervasive outside the west yet almost never acknowledged of market dominant minorities ethnic minorities who for widely varying reasons tend under market conditions to dominate economically the indigenous majorities around them chinese in indonesia whites in zimbabwe and indians in kenya are other examples market dominant minorities are the achilles heel of free market democracy in countries with a market dominant minority markets and democracy favor not just different people or different classes but different ethnic groups markets even if marginally lifting all boats concentrate wealth in the hands of the market dominant minority while democracy increases the political power of the impoverished majority under such circumstances the pursuit of free market democracy often becomes an engine of ethnic nationalism pitting a frustrated indigenous majority easily aroused by demagogic politicians against a resented wealthy ethnic minority this confrontation is playing out in venezuela today in 1998 mr chavez swept to electoral victory by attacking venezuela 's rotten white elites calling himself the indian from barinas and arousing into impassioned political consciousness venezuela 's impoverished pardos after taking power mr chavez disbanded the worm eaten mantuano dominated congress and supreme court he suspended privatization vowed to dismantle venezuela 's plantation system and decreed scores of laws intended to soften what he called savage capitalism predictably all this had a devastating effect on venezuela 's economy the coup against mr chavez last april was a classic effort by a market dominant minority to retaliate against a democratically elected if also blundering government threatening its wealth and power the interim president pedro carmona estanga was a wealthy white businessman union representatives were excluded from positions of authority to the dismay of the united states government which initially hailed the coup as a victory for democracy the high handed actions of the carmona regime combined with mr chavez 's still strong support among venezuela 's poor majority returned mr chavez to power with stunning speed what should the united states do now about venezuela candor would be a good start if we genuinely support democracy in developing countries we can not endorse coups even pro capitalist ones against democratically elected presidents moreover if global markets are to be sustainable ways must be found to spread their benefits beyond a handful of market dominant minorities and their foreign investor partners otherwise markets and democracy will continue to clash destabilizing economies and exacerbating ethnic conflict throughout the world amy chua professor of law at yale is author of world on fire how exporting free market democracy breeds ethnic hatred and global instability
 to the editor re blast kills sailors on us ship in yemen front page oct 13 is n't it time to realize that some of this country 's adversaries may have gotten the wrong impression from the rhetoric of the presidential campaign the fact is our military is stronger and readier than ever to respond to any crisis anywhere could the charge that we have a hollow military have been in part responsible for this tragedy we are strong and we are ready the men and women of the united states armed forces are dedicated to their mission and do it extremely well it 's time for the rhetoric to recognize the reality and to stop putting politics ahead of the country 's interest the well being of the men and women in the military depends on it john marshall columbus ohio oct 13 2000
 as united states troops rolled toward the iraq border this week they were given orders on two matters of decorum no throwing of candy to iraqi children and no displaying of flags regimental state or even the american flag military officials say that candy giveaways would draw swarms of children to the convoys a dangerous proposition with thousands of trucks humvees and trailers barreling toward baghdad as for the ban on flags its effect was apparent in this camp today where no more than a handful of vehicles mustering for the invasion displayed any officials say the flag could give the citizens of iraq the wrong idea about the convoys of artillery ammunition and soldiers they are not these officials say an army of conquest intent on claiming iraqi land or treasure for the united states but a liberation force they are concerned that streams of american flags would be seen as provocative it 's imposing enough that we 're coming into another society said capt frank stanco a commander with an artillery unit in the 101st airborne division i tell our soldiers we want to maintain our professionalism we could be making history i call it being quiet professionals in 1991 at the end of the persian gulf war american military convoys entered kuwait festooned with the stars and stripes after a quick rout of the iraqi army occupying the country soldiers recall being greeted rapturously by the kuwaitis this afternoon thousands of soldiers sat in long convoys fully packed and waiting for orders to begin an invasion that would carry many of them 400 miles north to baghdad only a handful of the vehicles flew american flags the no flags order was passed along to the 101st airborne by its commander maj gen david h petraeus who said the decision had been made by his superiors it 's the right thing to do said general petraeus a way of underscoring the american commitment to ousting the iraqi government to enhance security and human rights and not to seizing the country spokesmen for the united states central command in qatar said they were unable to provide information about the order today the question of flag flying provoked a small debate among artillery soldiers waiting to leave camp today specialist john garcia said he was angry that he had been ordered to take down his flag and that so few countries were supporting the united states and britain in the military campaign when they 're in trouble they do n't call russia china france turkey said specialist garcia they call 911 the united states that 's why i put my flag on my humvee another soldier specialist robert bratton said you ca n't blame them you got a lot of americans back in the states against it a sergeant elmer smith said the united states was seen as interfering in the affairs of too many countries specialist bratton said what 's the reason we 're fighting specialist garcia answered i think saddam hussein got them weapons specialist bratton shook his head i think it 's oil he said sergeant smith offered his theory i think it 's revenge for his father he said to captain stanco who did not take part in the debate over the war 's purpose the flag issue reflected the complexity of the american task in iraq we want to send the right statements he said
 because of an editing error an article on saturday about an assault by israelis on palestinian neighborhoods in hebron referred imprecisely at one point to its connection with an attack on a bus station on thursday in which a palestinian killed three israelis the israeli assault on hebron was partly in response to the wounding of two women in hebron by palestinians on friday it was not as the article noted elsewhere in retaliation for the attack at the bus station

existence for more than 200 years jules witcover columnist for the baltimore sun has been covering politics for about a quarter of that time in party of the people he surveys the democratic story from the days of thomas jefferson and james madison to the second gulf war during its long life the democratic party has changed its name confusingly for us jefferson and madison called themselves republicans to distinguish themselves from the monarchical tendencies they saw in the washington administration the founders used democrats almost as a cuss word savoring of radicalism and anarchy it was not until andrew jackson that jefferson 's heirs adopted the label the party has outlived numerous rivals in the 19th century the federalists of alexander hamilton and john adams and the whigs of henry clay and daniel webster became extinct the populists hijacked the democratic party then vanished in the 20th century die hard southerners bolted first under strom thurmond then under george wallace so did hard leftists under henry wallace in presidential contests the democrats have carried as many as 46 states and as few as 1 through all these vicissitudes mr witcover writes the party has pursued a commitment to social and economic justice that marked its earliest days this is a big subject and party of the people covers it unevenly at the start mr witcover 's survey of the decades before the civil war is slight and biased presenting all non democrats as mere agents of the rich how the virginia planters jefferson and madison turned the illegitimate immigrant hamilton into an aristocrat is one of the great spin operations of american political history at the end mr witcover 's account of the clinton years is remarkably evenhanded sure to displease both ann coulter and joe conason but there is little profit in repeating what no adult has forgotten mr witcover does best with the century from appomattox to john f kennedy this was the era of early modern politics of newspapers not television of bosses machines and contested presidential conventions whose end coincided with the beginning of mr witcover 's journalistic career he has combed the history books diligently and he has retrieved many vivid quotations which stand out from the marsh of his own prose when rutherford b hayes a republican ran for president in 1876 boasting of his honesty after the corruption of the grant administration the publisher joseph pulitzer said hayes has never stolen good god has it come to this in 1894 ben tillman a democrat from south carolina called president grover cleveland the leader of his own party an old bag of beef adding i am going to washington with a pitchfork and prod him in his old fat ribs william jennings bryan the nebraska democrat who won his party 's presidential nomination in 1896 when he was only 36 was known as the boy orator of the platte half a century later the republican thomas dewey another youthful presidential candidate had an altogether different persona he was known as the boy orator of the platitude in 1956 yet another youngster senator john f kennedy sought the vice presidential nomination the house speaker sam rayburn was not impressed calling him that little pissant the weakness of mr witcover 's storytelling is a cartoonish focus on the moment that leaves the reader wondering how individuals and voting blocs change for good or ill he praises the democrats for the practicality and idealism they have shown since jefferson 's day in appealing to recent immigrants yet when he comes to write of the scandals associated with tammany hall in new york he accuses boss tweed its leader of relying on the votes of easily manipulated immigrants daniel patrick moynihan would have known how to balance the outreach and the manipulation mr witcover simply shuffles the two ideas like cards he praises bryan 's 1896 campaign for electrifying the common people of the rural south and west thirty years later when bryan and these same people oppose the presidential ambitions of al smith the roman catholic new yorker they have become censorious rubes supporting prohibition as the centerpiece of their war against sin mr witcover who lives with all of us in the midst of a modern drug war might look at the prohibitionists with a shock of recognition and empathy he understands his republican foils no better than he understands his democratic heroes and this failure drains his book of drama his credo for the democratic party was foreshadowed by the young bryan when he urged it to choose the have nots over the haves on one side stand the corporate interests of the nation its moneyed institutions its aggregations of wealth and capital imperious arrogant compassionless they demand special legislation favors privileges immunities on the other side stands the unnumbered throng which gave a name to the democratic party and for which it has assumed to speak work worn and dust begrimed they make their mute appeal bryan 's opponent in 1896 william mckinley made an equally fervent statement of the archetypal republican position all attempt to array class against class the classes against the masses section against section labor against capital poor against rich or interest against interest is in the highest degree reprehensible over the years each major party has betrayed its ideals even at the level of oratory so often as to make these earnest statements almost embarrassing yet they are not mere boilerplate they do capture fundamental truths about the populist and nationalist yin and yang of our politics a book sensitive to the energies swirling about these two poles would be gripping lacking that sensitivity party of the people is a donkey and elephant show with donkeys in the spotlight political enthusiasts and toastmasters for jefferson jackson day dinners will be able to mine this book for useful material other readers would be better off buying a good general history of

 it is hard to imagine malaysia without mahathir mohamad prime minister for 22 years dr mahathir has become synonymous with his nation other than the weather little happens in malaysia beyond his control and some credit him with the rainfall but dr mahathir stepped down yesterday his final days in office were like his two decades of rule filled with controversy his scripted departure was marred by an anti semitic diatribe at an islamic leaders conference dr mahathir turned over power to a handpicked successor his earlier choice for heir is still imprisoned on false charges and left a nation that is prosperous but undemocratic corrupt and lacking the institutions necessary for enduring success when dr mahathir a doctor became prime minister in 1981 a quarter of all malaysians were poor today only one in 20 is poor per capita income has tripled after trying the nationalization of industry and heavy foreign investment dr mahathir isolated malaysia from the global financial markets during the asian crisis of 1997 the currency controls he imposed were widely criticized including by this page but appear to have kept malaysia 's economy stable as its neighbors collapsed dr mahathir a malay nationalist did relax affirmative action laws that favored ethnic malays over the prosperous ethnic chinese while he has avoided an islamic extremist threat he did so by rhetorically joining the extremists most recently dr mahathir made a poisonous speech in which he said that jews run the world by proxy comments that sadly drew applause from the organization of the islamic conference malaysia 's economic progress under dr mahathir may ultimately be undermined by his destructive legacy of personal allegiance in place of the rule of law there was virtually no check on his power and corruption and cronyism ran rampant his whims led the country into outlandish economic adventures like an attempt to corner the world market on tin his fearsome political police keep opponents in jail the courts the media and the universities are subservient in 1998 jealous of the popularity of his heir apparent deputy prime minister anwar ibrahim dr mahathir had mr anwar arrested on charges of abuse of power and sodomy after a politically orchestrated prosecution mr anwar was sentenced to 15 years it was disappointing but unsurprising that dr mahathir failed to do the right thing before he left office releasing mr anwar the new prime minister abdullah ahmad badawi has given no indication that he will change dr mahathir 's authoritarian style of rule but by freeing mr anwar he could right a tremendous injustice and signal that he at least can see that long term prosperity depends on real government and not the whims of one powerful man
 the arkansas that bill and hillary clinton used to live in does not seem to have been part of normal reality it 's more of a parallel universe like the one the wizards inhabit in harry potter books only uncharming revisit the arkansas of the 70 's and 80 's as we have been forced to do on a regular basis for the last eight years and it appears that the entire state consisted of only about 100 extremely talkative people all of them either emotionally disturbed or teetering on the brink of bankruptcy the rest of the planet has moved on since the days when bill clinton was an arkansas pol but that little world stays in place chewing on bitter herbs and drinking from the well of recovered memories this week it spit out another new recollection via jerry oppenheimer 's state of a union a book about the clintons marriage that reports that hillary used an anti semitic epithet in 1974 this is a very big week for clinton literature today marks the unveiling of joe eszterhas 's american rhapsody a book that answers the oft posed question what does the writer of the movie 'basic instinct make of the monica lewinsky affair mr eszterhas offers several new anecdotes about sharon stone takes the reader on a pretend journey through the sexual reveries of important republicans and claims that steven spielberg would have produced his screenplay about a fictional president who practices bestiality if only he had not been afraid of upsetting the clintons but we digress the anti semitism charge comes from paul and mary lee fray two of the chattiest charter citizens in the razorback version of the land that time forgot the frays figure prominently in just about every clinton tome ever written except it takes a village mr fray ran bill clinton 's unsuccessful congressional campaign in 1974 while his wife was delegated to give hillary hints about nail polish and accessorizing on the night that the campaign ended in defeat the two couples had a knock down drag out fight that has become one of the great set pieces of clinton legend it ended spectacularly when the enraged mary lee decided to enlighten hillary about bill 's other girlfriends past and present over the years mr fray has helped inquiring reporters with stories about bill clinton 's womanizing drug use among campaign workers and rumors in arkansas that hillary was a lesbian the anti semitic angle never came up but in the universe where the frays dwell the past is process and their latest recounting of the great fight begins with hillary storming into the campaign headquarters and denouncing the stunned mr fray as a expletive deleted jew bastard that would have been a terrible ugly moment if mr fray was actually a baptist with a jewish father as he told mr oppenheimer it would be very bad even if mr fray 's jewish lineage was confined to one great grandmother as he told the times this week but you would have to presume that hillary a self absorbed 26 year old was devoting an enormous amount of attention to the details of her boyfriend 's campaign manager 's family tree at an emotional press conference over the weekend mrs clinton denied the frays charges and her outrage seemed genuine just as it did earlier this year when rudy giuliani accused her of being an enemy of religion after years of dodging allegations about white house cover ups and health care screw ups and questionable profits on cattle futures hillary clinton has enjoyed several opportunities during her new york senate campaign to deny responsibility for things she actually did not do nobody else has come forward with another example of mrs clinton ever having made an anti semitic statement and friends of the first lady went out of their way to recount instances in which she 'd angrily used salty language in a slur free context i remember streams of obscenities one overenthused a former arkansas campaign aide meanwhile jumped in on the side of the frays in the end the public will have to decide for itself whether hillary clinton one of the most politically correct people on the planet chose to express her anger 25 years ago by homing in on the ethnicity of a guy 's great grandmother there 's no way to prove a negative but if you buy this one i 've got some information on the murder of vince foster by the israeli secret service that you 'll really enjoy

 fiat and its principal shareholder the agnelli family of italy joined with the french national utility today in a hostile bid for control of italy 's second largest utility montedison late today fiat and the utility electricite de france said that they had so far reached agreements for control of 5209 percent of montedison 's shares with a bid that values the company at 42 billion the alliance of the agnellis and the french utility at first took many investors in italy and france by surprise that the agnellis italy 's most powerful industrial clan would come to the rescue of a government owned french company seeking to gain a toehold in the lucrative italian energy market was unusual enough the move was all the more startling because it pitted fiat and the agnellis against the milan investment bank mediobanca once a faithful ally of the agnellis in the salotto buono or polite salon where the affairs of italian finance have discreetly been arranged for decades but investors soon recognized the logic in the alliance with electricite de france the agnelli family is no no stranger to france and in recent years has extended its large holdings north of the alps acquiring such diverse assets as the foundry and machinery units of the french automaker renault and a controlling stake in the french resort company club mediterranee if 10 years ago fiat represented 80 percent of the agnelli holdings today the figure is about 57 percent and much of the increase elsewhere has been through investment in france nor was the decision to move against mediobanca on closer inspection so startling enrico cuccia mediobanca 's former chairman had forged the secretive investment bank into a kind of club of northern italy 's powerful industrialists after mediobanca was founded in 1946 and mr cuccia then a dynamic young banker was put in charge in its glory days mediobanca was a kind of house bank of the agnellis and of italy in 1986 for instance mr cuccia helped the agnellis get rid of the libyan leader muammar el qaddafi as shareholder in fiat by buying back shares of the fiat automotive empire worth over 3 billion but mr cuccia died last year at 92 and though by then he was only the honorary chairman of mediobanca his departure from the scene appeared to signal the end of the 1990 's period of upheaval in italian business and finance indeed there appeared to be a certain symbolism in the emergence of montedison as the bone of contention between the agnellis and mediobanca in 1993 it was mr cuccia and mediobanca who fulfilled their traditional role in italian business and lined up italian industrial and financial investors to take montedison under their wing by exchanging debt for equity after montedison 's former majority shareholder the ferruzzi group collapsed under a mountain of debt and its creator and chairman raul gardini committed suicide but the disappearance of groups like ferruzzi and industrialists like mr gardini in the financial and industrial upheaval that swept italy in the 1990 's only served to cement the position of fiat and the agnellis at the center of italian business moreover as italy was forced to face the challenges of globalization fiat extended its international reach in 1998 the agnellis picked paolo fresco to be chairman of fiat he was an executive at general electric for almost four decades and became vice chairman under john f welch jr and last year fiat brought in general motors as a major shareholder by contrast mediobanca has struggled to keep its influence from dwindling whittled down by the invasion into italy of big wall street investment banks in the end it was montedison that prompted fiat and mediobanca to cross swords earlier this year gianni agnelli the family patriarch and honorary chairman of fiat suggested that he had little faith in mediobanca and the financial investors that controlled montedison to develop a long term industrial plan such a plan appeared all the more crucial mr agnelli believed given the deregulation of the italian energy market in which montedison is the second biggest player after the former national monopoly enel and the most efficient then in mid may electricite de france announced that it had acquired a 397 percent stake in montedison which it soon increased to 20 percent with an apparent eye to using montedison as a vehicle for entering the italian energy market itay objecting to electricite de france 's continued ownership by france and french sluggishness in opening the french energy market where electricite de france has a 90 percent grip capped electricite de france 's voting rights in montedison fiat and electricite de france created a consortium called italenergia to absorb the montedison holding company and its power generating unit edison italenergia is 40 percent owned by fiat and 18 percent by electricite de france with the remainder in the hands of financial partners it has offered 282 euros about 241 a share for the remaining stock in montedison valuing montedison at about 42 billion fiat generates power for its factories and occasionally sells surplus electricity onto the national energy grid its expansion into power generating while leaving the management to electricite de france fits well with the concept of conglomerate that mr fresco learned at the feet of jack welch utilities are always seen as cash cows that can enhance cash flow while cars rely on the state of the economy noted gareth williams an analyst with the actinvest group

 like its makers the rake 's progress has no permanent home but in celebration of its 50th anniversary this paean by stravinsky to the classical era has returned to the birthplace of its principal librettist w h auden and to the source of its inspiration the rake begins with hogarth 's pictures of a profligate england auden 's words more were added by chester kallman set the stage together they put the english national opera 's new production in its natural element a company known for operas in english has this part of its work already done meanwhile the conception of the director annabel arden accepts the rootlessness and contradictions of this fascinating troubling opera for what they are pushing each element to its limits and leaving the audience to sort out the results stravinsky and auden two expatriates one russian the other english found themselves in postwar america remembering an italian viennese style of opera then dead for a century and a half this production follows them and period is ignored we are given new york policemen yankee sailors top hatted swells and rough trade gays nick shadow 's minions are british civil servants in bowler hats baba the turk 's sedan chair is a miniaturized sputnik she sings through a porthole the auction scene is swaddled in yellow police tape shadow 's bread making machine is a kind of atm tom rakewell 's dress flirts with 18th century fashion but his name engraved corporate style in granite suggests the pitfalls of the american dream as a subtheme hogarth and damon runyon function side by side and why not the rake 's progress was always tortured by conflicting premises it begins with high minded artificiality a conscious attempt to recreate an 18th century opera in which the orchestral effects and vocal formats refer to mozart but where most of the notes go to great lengths to avoid sounding anything like him ms arden highlights the artifice encouraging us to witness both the drama and the theatrical craft behind it much of the evening is played in front of the london coliseum 's fire curtain or a facsimile thereof shadow cues his continuo harpsichordist who sometimes leaves the pit himself and becomes a player onstage chorus members handling viciously difficult music with great style periodically retreat to the boxes and become an audience within an audience auden 's texts acknowledge the conventions of da ponte period librettos but work hard to mock them and rise above them given the nature of operatic singing the acoustics of opera theaters and stravinsky 's weird and jumpy application of syllable to musical rhythm much of auden 's cleverness is more effectively read at home than heard in performance it may be too good for opera altogether indeed the rake is a thoughtful work by intelligent men and one can argue that too much thought never did opera much good the innocence and directness of the evening 's lovers tom rakewell and anne trulove must play against the soft shoe routines of shadow and company and all the allusions to opera history and 1950 's new york ms arden sends the lovers on their way with an intensity and directness that peers through the surrounding sophistication on thursday she had an excellent pair in barry banks and lisa milne a tenor and a soprano with finished voices good diction and a touching belief in what they were doing the rake invites us to admire its elegance from a distance and yet lose ourselves in doomed love these two made a strong case for that possibility gidon saks who towers over mr banks makes much of nick shadow he sings beautifully and is light of foot exhibiting both the devil 's charm and his menace sally burgess as baba and rebecca de pont davies as mother goose are nicely decadent john graham hall sellem and gerard o'connor trulove give strong performances vladimir jurowski 's conducting emphasizes the warmth and civility of stravinsky 's classical era transformations where others have stressed their brightness and hard angles the coliseum 's audience was cordial but not ecstatic
 the recruit which opens nationwide today takes place within the shadowy world of the central intelligence agency where we are repeatedly told nothing is what it seems this is true of the movie as well it seems like a spy thriller but it really is n't sure there are car and foot chases some gunplay a lot of breathless exposition and the frenetic uploading and downloading of files that is a staple of the modern high tech hollywood suspense film but for all of its slick manufactured suspense and a surprise twist that will come as a surprise to exactly no one this movie directed with shrugging professionalism by roger donaldson no way out 13 days belongs to a very special genre the al pacino crazy mentor picture examples include donnie brasco scent of a woman devil 's advocate and any given sunday in each of these movies mr pacino is paired with a younger actor johnny depp chris o'donnell keanu reeves jamie foxx to enact a peculiar generational battle whose outcome is usually a mutual learning of lessons often the temperamental contrast between the characters is reflected in approaches to acting mr pacino 's style the method gone mad is gestural and confrontational with a lot of shouting and muttering while his co stars adopt a cooler warier stance his roots are in the heat and dust of midcentury american realist theater theirs tend to be in the hip detachment of television and though these movies vary in quality and interest they share a lurching improvisational rhythm that makes them interesting to watch in the recruit mr pacino with jet black hair and a diabolical goatee shambles and blusters in his usual way turning the screenplay 's flavorless dialogue written by roger towne kurt wimmer and mitch glazer into mad poetry full of non sequiturs odd pauses and sudden barks and whispers it is almost worth the price of a ticket or at least of a video rental to hear him utter the words bethesda abu nidal and kurt vonnegut though not i 'm sad to say in the same sentence which would have been truly wonderful like christopher walken or marlon brando mr pacino frequently uses his gifts to make mediocre movies more interesting everything else in the recruit may be tiresomely predictable but he at least is not mr pacino is playing not that it really matters since his crazy mentor roles are best seen as episodes in a single continuing performance a man named walter burke whose job is to recruit and train operatives for the cia his protege is an mit graduate student named james clayton colin farrell who in addition to designing some kind of super powerful software application runs a web site devoted to his father an oil executive who died mysteriously in peru burke who has a scary eye for talent persuades james to come to the farm the agency 's top secret training facility a kind of hogwarts for spies there the young man develops a crush on a fellow recruit named layla bridget moynahan and endures a hall of mirrors initiation meant to test his mettle throw him off balance and provide the audience with a few jolts and reversals in anticipation of the main event which i wo n't give away beyond what the trailer has already spoiled nothing is what it seems there is a mole somewhere who could it be someone is betraying someone else guess who poor mr farrell spends his time in a caffeinated frenzy though layla is the habitual coffee drinker trying to maintain his leading man sang froid while registering panic stress and confusion he is without question a handsome and hardworking actor so hardworking it appears that he rarely has time to shave but his charisma and intensity have yet to generate a truly interesting performance some of the blame can no doubt be assigned to the material striving clumsy overdone pictures like tigerland and hart 's war but even as tom cruise 's apparent nemesis in the excellent minority report he seemed to be exerting himself to no clear purpose here for all his confident smirking anguished grimacing and brow furrowing torment his character remains a cipher you never really wonder or care about james 's motives or emotions mr pacino on the other hand is an exuberant riddle even though burke 's motives and emotions ultimately make no sense at all every time burke opens his mouth you wonder who on earth this guy is supposed to be and your realization that the character like the movie itself is incoherently conceived hardly matters it is both appalling and amusing to contemplate the cia as employing such a wing nut especially as a teacher of the young but really what mr pacino provides is an acting lesson one that mr farrell would do well to heed in an unimaginative by the book movie like this one the best thing an actor can do is dare to be strange

 edward said 's orientalism is one of the most influential academic books of its generation it points out in various ways how the east was orientalized by the west how the subtlety of life in places as diverse as japan java and the middle east was seen through lenses that robbed it of its individuality and how the east was stereotyped as a place of romance exotic beings haunting memories and landscapes remarkable experiences one outgrowth has been a lot of west bashing scholarship setting out from mr said 's notion of orientalism as a western style for dominating restructuring and having authority over the orient and linking like minded artistic impulses to imperialism thus the exotic whether in mozart 's seraglio or rimsky korsakov 's is today a suspect category intriguing and alluring to be sure but at its core an example of colonialist appropriation what could be more welcome and stimulating in this context than dream of the orient a deutsche grammophon archiv recording that mingles orientalist works by gluck mozart and lesser lights like johann martin kraus and franz xaver sussmayr with the authentic east concerto koln led by werner ehrhardt performs with vladimir ivanoff 's sarband a turkish ensemble both using original instruments a rousing performance of mozart 's overture to the abduction from the seraglio with more percussion than you 've ever heard is followed by turkish music notated and published by the marquis de ferriol in venice in 1787 both played by the combined ensembles excerpts from kraus 's soliman ii follow a transcription of a janissaries march transcribed by one dimitrie cantemir a moldavian prince who spent time in constantinople at the beginning of the 18th century these juxtapositions are jarring mozart 's overture sounds strict and formulaic after a traditional turkish introduction and another turkish number that follows it seems even more sinuous and flexible our usual vantage point is restored after 30 seconds or so but the effect of these musics on each other is potent the album represents a coming together in other ways less audible in a note how our dream of the orient came true mr ehrhardt describes the difficulty each ensemble had in playing the other 's music the european players kept pressing forward and leaving behind their turkish colleagues who had a completely different and more relaxed approach to the question of tempo he mentions how puzzled the turkish players were by rests in the percussion parts for them it was completely absurd to stop playing for whole bars one wishes there were more in the notes much more about the process of putting the recording together and especially about the turkish pieces themselves this is one of the few weaknesses of a project that cries out for greater explanation and contextualization at the center of the dream experience is the specter of a naive western distortion of a subtler original mr ivanoff in his note speaks of figures who notated turkish music in the 17th and 18th centuries thanks to their writings on turkish culture and their collections of music these contemporary witnesses allow us to hold up the mirror of european exoticism to its actual real life object i have as much confidence in my specialized knowledge of turkish music as i do in my ability to illuminate the past precisely which is to say not much but i can state without fear of contradiction that ferriol 's turkish concerto in the hijaz scale is not a real life object in any sense how could it be first it is a centuries old transcription of a living music by a foreign observer we know how even the most sensitive local observers transform musical substances according to their own predispositions leos janacek for example an expert on moravian folk speech and song tended to impose his favorite interval patterns on his scientific transcriptions even the most gifted listeners hear what they want to hear and what they are trained to hear in addition given that mr ivanoff has himself arranged the transcription and that concerto koln is playing along what you have is simply another level of exoticism strangely parts of this track sound not unlike a hollywood harem fantasy speaking of hollywood as i ponder these issues the recruit is showing on the airplane and its theme reiterated several times by al pacino runs to nothing is what it seems to be in the film it refers to the cia spooks art of deception but it also rings true in the world of exoticism and in music in general most of us do n't need reminders to be skeptical of gluck 's attempt in his overture to the unexpected meeting to frame the orient but we might forget to apply the same skepticism to pieces played by sarband although mr ivanoff 's arrangements may be closer to authentic turkish music than mozart 's turkish rondo that just makes them more seductive examples of orientalism even as we enjoy them we should be on our guard and wonder why we want to hear them as some kind of real thing when they are at best fantastical reconstructions of an irretrievable past describing sussmayr 's turkish symphony mr ivanoff writes only in the final movement does the european orchestra finally seize control of the coveted turkish percussion instruments and launch into a hapsburg victory march my own hearing of this movement does not take such an imperial view of matters the finale is a brief rondo and while the main idea is an abduction imitation the interludes are altogether different for sussmayr seems to be trying to get closer to the spirit of turkish music in these middle sections with their perpetual motion and modal inflections how fitting the more real orient is trapped in an inner section like a fly in amber captured amid the caricature outer part much the way the orient is said to have been subdued and abused by the west but mr ivanoff 's mention of the hapsburgs should remind us of the polyglot strivings of that empire instead of reading orientalism darkly as is so often done today one can also happily celebrate the austro hungarian sense of inclusiveness where pastorale bachian counterpoint and the exotic lie cheek by jowl and ultimately mozart 's turkish music is about mozart being as much a comment on the orient as bach 's french suites are a statement about the french though relations between france and germany are perhaps of less international moment today than those between orient and occident we should resist the temptation to apply tendentious contemporary politics to artistic endeavors of the past rather we might profitably follow the probing and celebratory strivings of concerto koln and sarband and add our own dreams to them as well michael beckerman a specialist in east european music teaches at new york university
 the free throw by connecticut 's taliek brown bounced off the rim and the huskies putback also missed finally seton hall had something to celebrate so in the moments following the pirates 65 63 victory today their players and fans joined to form a mosh pit in front of the pirates bench the emotions of relief may be fleeting and they could extinguish in the next few days but for the first time in weeks the pirates have a future darius lane who did not start after arriving late for a meeting earlier this week made the go ahead 3 pointer with 61 seconds left to give seton hall the victory at continental arena in front of 18055 its largest home crowd in five years it 's definitely a relief lane said it 's been an up and down season for our team and myself this was a big shot for myself and a big win for our team seton hall 14 13 over all 5 11 big east squeaked into next week 's big east tournament and avoided having to watch rutgers 's game against providence this afternoon to find out its fate rutgers entered the day in last place one game behind the pirates in the west division but held the tie breaker because it had swept the pirates but seton hall 's victory made rutgers 's outcome moot and set up a matchup of two disappointing programs seton hall and st john 's which did not play in the regular season meet in the first round of the conference tournament on wednesday at 2 pm at madison square garden the pirates most likely guaranteed themselves a postseason they avoided having a losing record and qualified for consideration for the national invitation tournament connecticut 19 10 8 8 earned a no 6 seeding and will play either georgetown or syracuse which both play sunday depending on which team finishes third in the west trailing 63 62 seton hall regained possession with 179 seconds left following a traveling call on connecticut 's caron butler his second in the closing minutes pirates coach tommy amaker designed the play for lane to run off two screens on the baseline and take the final shot pirates guard ty shine dribbled into the corner and passed to lane who hit the 25 foot jumper with 61 seconds left lane had arrived late for a meeting with amaker this week causing his removal from the starting lineup amaker said lane probably felt upset and embarrassed with the demotion but lane said he was more motivated by the pirates loss at villanova on wednesday he scored 5 points in that game and his friends and family in minnesota watched that game on television and told him it was the worst they 've ever seen me play lane said we just did n't look like we wanted to play he said this was a total turnaround despite a messy first half today seton hall played with intensity to snap a three game losing streak and win for only the third time in 13 games and lane said eddie even came out and played hard eddie griffin who scored a game high 16 points has been booed by pirates fans for his sometimes passive effort but he too found a winning ending connecticut called a timeout with 18 seconds left and edmund saunders inbounded the ball to brown on the perimeter but the seton hall freshman marcus toney el was caught in a switch tripped and ran into brown for a foul with half a second remaining brown a freshman missed the front end of the one and one and connecticut 's johnnie selvie missed the tip in igniting the celebration i guess it was a good thing i fouled taliek because there was a lot of pressure on him toney el said griffin said he felt mad after the foul but then felt fortunate because selvie had leaped over him for the tip oh it 's going to be my fault now griffin said he told himself griffin said he never considered that this may have been his final college game he bypassed a chance to play in the national basketball association so he could attend seton hall and said he has not decided whether to return for his sophomore season or enter the nba draft seton hall 's troubles this season began jan 6 when griffin punched shine in the locker room after he felt shine was not passing him the ball shine was the darling of the pirates run to the round of 16 last season today shine scored all 8 of his points in the second half his three free throws with 7 minutes 1 second left gave the pirates their first lead in three games ty 's always made big baskets big shots for us his entire career amaker said i think he has the confidence and the guts to do those things rebounds this was seton hall coach tommy amaker 's first victory over connecticut in eight attempts the pirates last crowd this big was also against uconn seton hall drew 20029 on march 2 1996

 wolfgang holzmair baritone austrian cultural forum the austrian baritone wolfgang holzmair has an extraordinary way of addressing you directly and intensely when he is singing in a regular concert hall so the tiny space of the auditorium at the austrian cultural forum could bring him little benefit when he performed there on friday evening with russell ryan at the piano there may even have been disadvantages in that both artists had to restrain themselves and in that so few people 60 or so were able to hear mr holzmair in unusual repertory most certainly there was a big disadvantage in philipp harnoncourt 's staged installation a hesitant sequence of projections presenting images and sometimes the text for color and atmosphere one needed only mr holzmair 's singing for words too he being such a master of diction and inflection he began with schoenberg 's cycle the book of the hanging gardens the work in which sensuous festering poems by stefan george became the vehicle for early atonal wanderings often sung by sopranos who easily seem to inhabit the spiritualized air of the music more than the jungle of the poetry beneath the piece here became a union of word and sound for mr holzmair singing is the best way of speaking poetry he seemed in the thick of george 's troubled solitary desire and that way he was in the thick too of the music 's transcription of spurts of feeling and deadened lack of feeling five morike songs by wolf continuing on from the schoenberg george with no break gradually drew back or forward to self certainty and pleasure in life while giving mr holzmair abundant further opportunities to show his sensitivity to words in the sudden brightness of erstaunt for example contrasting with the velvety enclosure of anschaun he ended with der abschied from the song of the earth which does not sound well on the piano that however did not stop him from suggesting the same anxious personality moving through planes of hope to arrive not as usual at release but at a question paul griffiths

 to the editor although david wondrich in his article ragtime no longer a novelty in sepia jan 21 is correct in saying that there is a greater availability than ever of ragtime recordings they have been accessible as reissues since the 1960 's his comment that the men who ran the recording industry left the piano music to the player piano is belied by the sheer number of ragtime and ragtime novelty piano sides that have been issued in the years since by pianists from felix arndt and mike bernard to eubie blake even less perceptive is his statement that ragtime was black music and universally acknowledged as such at the time the sad truth is that just as paul whiteman would later be called the king of jazz irving berlin was more likely to be identified as the king of ragtime than scott joplin berlin and many other white composers managed very quickly to usurp black influence and credit it 's also a pity that mr wondrich did n't mention prime african american composers of the ragtime years like chris smith irving jones and james bland it was largely through their efforts that african american ideas about music rhythm and lyrics were absorbed into the american popular musical mainstream allen lowe south portland me the writer is the author of american pop from minstrel to mojo on record 1893 1956 cadence jazz books 1998

 in the world of transportation there are few brand names to match that of the ho chi minh trail the secret shifting piecemeal network of jungle roadways that helped the north win the vietnam war most of the trail has been consumed by the forest in the 25 years since the war ended but its myth is still there indeed it seems to have seduced vietnam 's planners into a project that some outsiders say they find unrealistic and misguided the government announced friday that it planned to turn the faint remnants of the old trail into an honest to goodness highway that would link the north and the south for peaceful commerce as it once did for wartime supply and transport according to an announcement from hanoi wartime capital of the communist north and peacetime capital of a unified communist vietnam the 1000 mile 6786 million project is to be completed in just three years if they transported artillery pieces along it the reasoning seems to be they can mobilize to lay asphalt at a record pace an expert on vietnam at harvard university tom vallely was skeptical he called a paved road through the country 's western mountains something they do n't need that 's a misallocation of funds said mr vallely director of the vietnam program at the harvard institute of international development you are supposed to invest in things you need not in things you do n't need and you are supposed to invest in them in a timely way they already have a north south highway and there is not a lot of traffic on it he added i do n't think they 'll do it i ca n't imagine they 'll do it i do n't think any international donor would touch it the government envisions a two lane road to supplement the current coastal route highway 1 with an eventual expansion of the mountain road to six busy high speed lanes it is easy to see the attraction of the idea the ho chi minh trail has been the stuff of legend for both america and vietnam since it confounded the united states military and led to a secret border crossing bombing campaign that helped draw cambodia into the horrors of the war begun in 1959 as a hidden trail through the jungle it expanded over the years into a network of five main routes portions of them paved that dipped back and forth across the borders with laos and cambodia for both sides the trail symbolized the determination and ingenuity of the north and the overmuscled inability of america 's war machine to cope with small bore guerrilla tactics at one point near the end of the war for example frustrated american commanders ordered that in certain intractable hostile areas any gatherings observed from the air of more than a handful of people would be attacked with b 52 strikes the war 's knockout punch capable of leveling an area the size of several football fields but no amount of bombing or the use of high tech sensory devices was able to slow for long the antlike traffic of men women trucks and bicycles that allowed the north to pursue the war in the south as the stuff of legend the ho chi minh trail has continued to inspire vietnam a nation that has not been able to show its people many heroic achievements since the war ended for a time a few years ago there was a notion some called it harebrained to exploit the trail as a tourist attraction according to the plan rich visitors would be ferried in by helicopter and housed in old bunkers converted into mini resorts visitors would be provided with the old time uniforms hats and walking sticks of the troops which will remind them or help them to imagine how it was for people and soldiers during the war said the plan 's promoter an architect named hoang phuc thang in its way mr vallely said the road building plan seems almost as misguided it would take resources from things they need like education or science or building urban infrastructure or getting successful provinces more ports he said i think the idea of integrating is good access roads electricity the internet there are all sorts of ways to get the country connected better and cheaper than this in the former saigon which now also bears the name of vietnam 's wartime leader ho chi minh coffee table books are for sale with propaganda photographs of the famous trail though much of it has disappeared now its essence is alive in these pictures singing optimistic soldiers men and women with bouquets of camouflage leaves on their pith helmets determined patriotic fighters heaving heavy machinery through ravines and across streams not mention the endless chinese made bicycles overladen like beasts of burden with more supplies than the laws of physics would ever approve but of course the miracle of the ho chi minh trail was that it accomplished the impossible if the vietnamese had listened to experts at harvard they would have given up without a fight so who knows
 this month in the brazilian state of para the wealthy and influential rancher jeronimo alves amorim received a 19 year prison term for ordering the murder of a rural union leader expedito ribeiro de souza nine years ago more than 1000 activists for the landless such as mr ribeiro de souza have been killed in brazil in the last 10 years only a handful of the murderers have been tried virtually all of them low level hired triggermen the conviction and sentencing of the powerful mr amorim is one of several recent setbacks for brazil 's ranchers whose drive for land is furthering the destruction of the amazon and condemning peasants to lives of destitution brazil has one of the world 's most unequal patterns of land distribution one percent of landowners own half the agricultural land much of it idle bought for speculation brazilian law allows land to be expropriated if it does not fulfill its social function tens of thousands of peasants have won title after occupying idle land but millions remain landless and their leaders run huge risks other victims are rubber tappers who live in the forests claimed and burned by ranchers and farmers the ranchers have great political power in rural brazil and in congress they have little to fear from the justice system or the police who have themselves massacred the landless in 1996 19 peasants were killed and dozens injured when they clashed with military police in para state last year three police commanders were acquitted of the massacre after a trial marred by evidence tampering and accusations of jury bribery president fernando henrique cardoso criticized the verdict his government supports some land reform but the ranchers lobby has been able to block progress after the landless movement occupied government ministries recently mr cardoso cracked down establishing a federal police unit to deal with the movement and making it harder for those who occupy land to win title to it but brazil 's state and federal authorities also feel pressure from sectors of the catholic church environmentalists and the growing movement of the landless who can mobilize a network of supporters abroad on controversial issues these voices can be persuasive para has now ordered a new trial for the police accused of the 1996 massacre ranchers had sought a change in forestry laws that could have allowed a 25 percent increase in the clearing of amazon forests last month in congress the legislation was unexpectedly defeated mr amorim 's sentence is perhaps the most significant victory in the courts the challenge for brazil however is to do justice and make fair land decisions even in the cases that never make headlines

 by many social financial educational and health measures the well being of america 's children has been improving according to a new report from the federal government while children are still more likely to be living in poverty than adults the child poverty rate has been dropping steadily in 1999 16 percent of the nation 's children lived in families below the poverty line the lowest rate in two decades and two percentage points less than in 1998 the decline was especially sharp in households headed by women and in black families according to the report the fifth annual compilation of data on children from a dozen federal departments and agencies these findings represent important victories for children and adolescents said dr duane alexander director of the national institute of child health and human development children are less likely to live in poverty more likely to have a parent working full time and more likely to have health insurance in one measure of the strong economy of the 90 's the percentage of children living in households with at least one employed parent rose to 79 percent in 1999 from 77 percent in 1998 and 72 percent in 1994 on this measure too children living with single mothers showed the most improvement but children living below the poverty line are increasingly likely to have at least one parent working full time year round in 1999 31 percent of children in poverty had an employed parent compared with 21 percent in 1980 the proportion of children covered by health insurance rose to 86 percent in 1999 the highest since 1995 there were 704 million children under 18 in the united states in 2000 or 26 percent of the population down from a peak of 36 percent at the end of the baby boom that percentage is expected to remain relatively stable with children making up 24 percent of the population in 2020 the diversity of american children is growing with the hispanic population increasing fastest in 2000 16 percent of the nation 's children were hispanic up from 9 percent in 1980 sixty four percent were white 14 percent black 4 percent asian pacific islander and 1 percent american indian over the last two decades the percentage of school age children who speak a language other than english at home and have difficulty speaking english has nearly doubled to 5 percent in 1999 from 28 percent in 1979 the percentage of children living with one parent increased to 26 percent in 2000 from 20 percent in 1980 and the proportion of children living with single fathers doubled to 4 percent in 2000 from 2 percent in 1980 according to the report put out by the federal interagency forum on children and family statistics adolescents cigarette use is declining among 12th graders the proportion of daily smokers was 21 percent in 2000 down from a recent high of 25 percent in 1997 among 8th graders 7 percent reported smoking daily last year compared with 10 percent alcohol and illicit drug use did not change substantially with about 30 percent of 12th graders reporting that they had at least five drinks in a row in the previous two weeks and about 25 percent of them reporting drug use in the previous month the percentage of young adults completing high school has increased although the proportion earning a regular diploma has been dropping the increase in those obtaining an alternative high school credential has more than made up the difference other findings included these adolescent deaths declined to an all time low of 71 deaths per 100000 the greatest declines were in firearm deaths which dropped to 16 deaths per 100000 adolescents in 1998 from 28 deaths in 1994 almost 60 percent of 16 year olds were employed at some point in the school year as were about 18 percent of the 14 year olds the violent crime victimization rate for 12  to 17 year olds dropped to 20 per 1000 in 1999 from 25 per 1000 in 1998 although that change is not statistically significant it is part of a longer term downward trend in which the number of assaults rapes robberies and killings of youth has declined by half since 1994 one troubling finding of the report was the increasing prevalence of asthma the most common chronic childhood illness more than 5 percent of children under 18 had asthma in 1998 an increase of more than 20 percent in a decade in 1981 3 percent of children had asthma and by 1988 that figure rose to 4 percent
 the director shekhar kapur 's remake of the four feathers is a tepid shallow tributary of larger deeper bodies of waters like the historical revisionist film dramas last of the mohicans which was also a remake and little big man heath ledger stars as harry feversham an officer in queen victoria 's army full of mellow bonhomie and a cheeky modesty in the late 1800 's he and his unit are in training in the british army and feathers gives us a protracted and reverent look at their life harry and his best pal jack durrance wes bentley wearing a silly smirk that suggests he ca n't believe he 's being paid for his bad british accent are mad over ethne ethne is played by kate hudson who seems to have been hired for balance she possesses the one mock english accent worse than mr bentley 's but ethne is wild about harry when the friends unit is assigned to fight in sudan harry is overcome with fear at the prospect of battle jack and their fellow officers greet harry 's plight as a game that he is playing and since harry makes such a grandiloquent display of it and it 's filmed with wide screen splendor so that every twitch of his lachrymal glands seems visible we think so as well that is until harry resigns his commission drawing disdain from his father the general tim pigott smith who 's playing the same exemplar of british priggishness he displayed in jewel in the crown harry is given a white feather by four of his friends a public repudiation what do you do if you 're branded a coward and you know you 're a man in harry 's case it means you pack off to sudan wear a phony beard and join the natives in their battle harry could n't fool a distracted 4 year old but in one of the film 's many instances of absurdity he goes native and somehow suckers the africans his mission is to rescue his friends who quickly discover that they 're in way over their regiment this director would appear to be an ideal candidate to oversee a remake of feathers with his penchant for showing how personal politics fit into institutional cruelty as he did so elegantly in elizabeth and the bandit queen but feathers so grandly plays out the imperialist fraternity of the british army that it 's as if mr kapur were making a commercial for a way of life that no one misses if he wants to underscore the macho superficiality of the traditions the point could have been made much faster but the spectacle of clubby empty headed good cheer is so lovingly protracted this section takes up almost the first 20 minutes that we feel as if we 're trapped reading a tribute to someone who few people particularly care about it 's the kind of wrongheadedness that can make one reflect kindly back on the schoolyard testosterone antics of young guns a wild west drama with a superficial historical perspective the casting of feathers which opens today nationwide is along the same lines as guns the good humored mr ledger crunches his eyes into a pained crinkle at this point in his career he 's the wrong actor for this kind of thing his welterweight misery seems even punier when djimon hounsou makes his entrance as abou the requisite buffed sidekick abou barely lifts his eyelids past half staff when hearing of harry 's desperation to prove himself and his courage it 's embarrassing to treat abou as someone incapable of understanding loyalty especially when we know he 'll eventually come around to assisting harry in his struggle and of course wander off into the distance mr hounsou with his pride in movement and dogged confidence is the kind of handy presence the picture could use more of his eccentric pauses and laughs suggest a modern day version of ralph richardson one of the stars of the 1939 feathers and with its jumps from past to present the movie could use ballast an extended flashback just when it feels as if feathers should be ending will probably produce a number of heavy sighs from the audience the ragged condescension toward the natives which includes such exquisite exotica as the fashion model alek wek as a slave who saves harry 's life for a moment of kindness is the kind of tired patronizing that you 'd hope mr kapur could shove the four feathers past instead he is shackled to epic by the yard filmmaking on the other hand one of the most immediate and shocking benefits of his direction is the action sequences most notably one set piece in which an apparent victory immediately segues into a slaughter with angles filmed from a vulture 's eye view by the cinematographer robert richardson but such few assets are n't enough to alleviate the film 's shallowness the picture 's wheezing fussiness and devotion to the british empire and its minor nods to questioning unthinking loyalty to an ideal make the four feathers a possible first of a kind a movie that 's halfhearted about ambivalence the four feathers is rated pg 13 parents strongly cautioned for violence action some bloodshed and several scenes of single malt scotch swallowing the four feathers directed by shekhar kapur written by michael schiffer and hossein amini based on the novel by a e w mason produced by paul feldsher marty katz stanley r jaffe and

 dorothy dunnett a scottish historical novelist whose weighty works about renaissance life attracted swarms of devoted fans in the united states died on friday in edinburgh she was 78 her best known works the lymond chronicles in six books and the house of niccolo in eight have inspired conventions fan magazines among them a quarterly called kisses and marzipan and several internet forums packed with lively speculation ranging from points of history to the pedigrees of her characters and the subtly wrought links between the heroes of the two series mrs dunnett more properly dorothy lady dunnett tempted her fans with buried clues and red herrings that keep them reading and rereading the books anne malcolm writing in the the new york times book review last year said the chronicles although not widely known nearly 40 years after the first volume appeared are almost certainly destined to be counted among the classics of popular fiction identifying just what it is that sets them apart from other works of historical romance is difficult ms malcolm wrote although she cited a painter 's eye for gorgeous detail and a vocabulary that sometimes outstrips the shorter oxford english dictionary ms malcolm described the protagonist of the first series the fictional francis crawford of lymond a 16th century scot as the perfect romantic hero impossibly charming elegant and accomplished a brilliant swordsman an inspired leader of men who was also highhanded cynical and dangerous and not above employing a bit of violence when it suits his often veiled purposes for the uninitiated the uncomprehending or those whose linguistic spectrum spans fewer than half a dozen languages there is a guide to the minutiae of mrs dunnett 's work the dorothy dunnett companion by elspeth morrison vintage books 2001 from which the reader can learn the common punishment for adultery removal of the nose by biting or other means or a simple formula for hair dye involving leeches marinated in vinegar the companion offers a glimpse of the laborious process of writing the many layered historical novels which delve into the art culture manners and science of the times although mrs dunnett said the novels drew on her own background in music art and sailing they also involved a great deal of travel in search of authentic detail as well as dizzying amounts of library research until shortly before her death she was helping ms morrison complete a second companion volume mrs dunnett was born dorothy halliday on aug 25 1923 in dunfermline scotland she grew up largely in edinburgh and was at school at the same time as muriel spark at james gillespie 's school for girls the model for the academy in ms spark 's prime of miss jean brodie she said it had never been her intention to become a writer of fiction she studied music and art and took a job in britain 's ministry of information in 1946 she married her boss alastair dunnett and the couple moved to glasgow where mrs dunnett was employed by the board of trade and continued her studies in singing and painting she had become a professional portrait painter when her husband a banker author journalist and eventually an oil company executive suggested she write a novel he said make it a series they 're popular at the moment she wrote so always cooperative i did her first novel was rejected by five publishers in britain leading her husband to suggest she seek publication in the united states they like long books in america she quoted him as saying the book was accepted with the proviso that it be cut and the game of kings the opening book of the lymond chronicles was published by putnam in 1961 the other books in the lymond series are queen 's play 1964 the disorderly knights 1966 pawn in frankincense 1969 the ringed castle 1971 and checkmate 1975 an idea of the complexity of mrs dunnett 's books can be seen in the list of characters which in niccolo rising 1986 the first book in that series takes up four pages peppered with historical kings their mistresses medicis and merchants as well as invented characters the niccolo series about nicholas de fleury of burgundy a merchant also includes the spring of the ram 1987 race of scorpions 1989 scales of gold 1991 the unicorn hunt 1993 to lie with lions 1995 caprice and rondo 1997 and gemini 2000 she was also the author of a

 jack 's fifth is the name of the place it has a no nonsense american sound to it turn the name around and you get a fifth of jack 's it feels right if the laws were different every table at jack 's fifth would get a complimentary pack of luckies just for the visuals it 's that kind of restaurant a subterranean lair with a swanky bar lots of circular booths and a retro sense of style that 's part 1940 's nightclub part rat pack hangout herb wilson was most recently the chef at bambou but he started out working with patrick clark and later with larry forgione the influence shows in his vigorous uncomplicated approach to american food taking his cue from the setting he has come up with a menu that 's as reassuring as a firm handshake it 's strong on seasonal ingredients and uncompromising when it comes to delivering clearly defined flavors with a minimum of fuss when he falls short the food can be a little bland when he 's on target however it 's richly satisfying and refreshingly sane the grilled seafood sausage pleasingly plump comes stuffed with chunks of scallop lobster and shrimp a light ginger and lime sauce makes the fresh ocean flavors even more vivid i was unhappy to see the hazelnut crusted foie gras with figs disappear from the menu with the waning of the fig season but mr wilson has replaced it with something i like even better a big slab of seared foie gras resting on an oozing slice of caramelized pineapple you still get the hazelnuts sprinkled around the plate in a viscous syrup of meat juices and liquid fruit it 's cold outside mr wilson understands this in an act of mercy he has come up with a kind of dismantled cassoulet a dark steaming stew of braised oxtail oven dried tomatoes roasted carrots and firm cranberry beans another winter warmer on the appetizer side is his dense butternut squash soup flavored with curry and apple and scattered with toasted pepitas the meat entrees tend to be muscular and hearty so much so that they often overshadow the fish braised short ribs falling off the bone form a blissfully rich partnership with a fruity intense zinfandel sauce and a sweet satin textured parsnip puree mr wilson treats chicken like a heavyweight surrounding it with chanterelles leeks and spinach and giving it a port wine sauce to deal with it 's a mild surprise to see duck breast get relatively gentle handling with a light off sweet cider sauce and a southern accented accompaniment of grits with bits of pancetta and tiny roasted turnips and brussels sprouts roasted loin of lamb with wilted spinach in cardamom jus sounded promising but turned out to be curiously lacking in personality a lot like the rice crusted red snapper fitted out with a thai lite garnish of peanuts cucumber and mint that can only be described as diffident it needed a role model i suggest the parsley roasted halibut a fully empowered even swaggering piece of fish wearing the heady aroma of shiitake mushrooms and saffron like a designer fragrance heather carlucci most recently the pastry chef at pop but before that at judson grill shares some of mr wilson 's instincts her desserts rather than straining for effect rely on clear flavors placed in pleasing combinations her peanut butter ice cream sandwich sounded awful but the thing itself was impressive two paper thin oatmeal cinnamon coins provided the crunch and contrast to roasted peanut ice cream and banana slices caramelized in grappa pumpkin panna cotta with chestnuts and rum sabayon was a skillful very american rebuttal to creme brulee jack 's fifth is situated in an unforgiving space formerly occupied by pondicherry the ceilings are low there are no windows because the restaurant is one floor below street level in a mighty effort the restaurant 's designers have solved about three quarters of the problems banquettes and circular booths tend to focus the attention of diners on each other rather than the space around them and the s shaped bar off the entrance strikingly backlighted and hung with slinky fabrics goes a long way toward relieving the hovering sense of claustrophobia good spacing between tables also helps imagination failed however when it came to the old stock photographs that line the walls each one depicts an american worker dressed in the uniform of his or her trade like an emblem of honest labor the nurse rubs shoulders with the secretary who stands next to the welder and the deliveryman none of them would ever have eaten at a restaurant like jack 's fifth although they might have lived down the block from a bar called jack 's but i 'm willing to bet that every one of them would have understood the shell steak with onions and wine sauce and lemon meringue parfait jack 's fifth rating two stars 8 west 58th

 when it comes to polo or more precisely polo ralph lauren 's commercial sense has long outpaced the united states polo association 's from shirts to sheets to cologne polo is a near ubiquitous global brand and lauren perpetually relaxed looking and silver haired epitomizes elegant poloesque style a galling fact of life for the association unlike polo the association is engaged in the actual playing of polo as it has been since 1890 but lauren trademarked polo in 1967 in the 1960 's when ralph lauren got started everybody was playing polo and not interested in sports marketing merle jenkins the president of uspa properties said he said the association received 22 million in royalties last year from its licensing business of course polo and polo are associated with wealth or at least the impression of it lauren 's polo goods play off the cachet of riders atop horses galloping during seven minute periods on a 160 foot by 300 foot field the average polo player is a 40 year old man who earns 184000 a year and has a net worth of nearly 1 million according to the polo association with its 300 clubs and 3500 active members the association dearly wants to be like ralph and capitalize on being the true representative of polo not polo yet it says that the corporate ralph called polo ralph lauren has wielded a mighty mallet to keep the association from licensing a two horseman logo or really anything too polo y because it is too close to polo 's one horseman logo the latest chukker in their legal match part of a saga that is nearly 20 years old began last week when the polo association sued polo ralph lauren usa holdings in federal court in manhattan alleging that it maliciously acted to destroy the sports merchandising program of the us polo association by writing letters that intimidated retailers with trademark infringement lawsuits if they sold the association 's goods the lawsuit follows by 11 months polo 's still unresolved federal suit against the association for infringing on its rights by using the word polo and a player on a horse its dispute comes down to this odd notion polo does not wish the polo association to use the word polo alone to sell its goods the association believes that to be a straitjacket on its marketing we 're not saying polo ralph lauren should n't do what it does said jerry ferguson a lawyer for the association but we have a legitimate interest in the name polo les fagen a polo lawyer said a 1984 federal decree in an earlier lawsuit ordered that the association stay away from polo ralph lauren 's logos stay away from the horseman stay away from the name polo in trying to settle a lawsuit in the 1990 's the association said it presented all possible uses of its name logos and trademarks to polo for approval one that it approved the association says was the two horsemen upon that approval investments were made by the association and its licensees to make goods with the mallet swinging horsemen which is distinguished by one man and one horse from polo 's logo but fagen said polo never gave final approval earlier this year as they tried to settle last year 's lawsuit polo ralph lauren said the two horsemen infringed on its rights they say they did n't approve it even after approving it ferguson said when they changed their mind it devastated our business polo ralph lauren has told the association that it is ok to use some logos that say us polo association but not others that say the same thing because the polo is too prominent they have a name us polo association and if they can use it without confusing consumers they can do it fagen said if the association loses the lawsuit it may have to sell goods with a trademark horse logo we thought of becoming the us horse hockey association ferguson said but we do n't think the members would like it
 north korea 's military threatened today to abandon its commitment to the 1953 korean war armistice if the united states moves to impose penalties like a naval blockade for its suspected nuclear weapons program the north 's state run news media has kept the nation near a war hysteria since the nuclear crisis flared up last fall and it was not clear if the latest statement marked a real change in policy but the warning came from the nation 's all powerful military the korean people 's army the kpa side will be left with no option but to take a decisive step to abandon its commitment to implement the armistice agreement as a signatory to it and free itself from the binding force of all its provisions regarding the possible sanctions to be taken by the us side against the dprk the army statement said using the initials of north korea 's formal name the democratic people 's republic of korea on monday the new york times reported that bush administration officials were drawing up detailed contingency plans for penalties including the interception of north korean ships carrying arms and missiles for export if the us side continues violating and misusing the armistice agreement as it pleases there will be no need for the dprk to remain bound to the aa uncomfortably said the statement published by the north 's official korean central news agency the statement was issued by the army mission at the border truce village of panmunjom 30 miles north of seoul the south 's capital in seoul this morning the south korean defense ministry spokesman said no unusual moves by the north koreans were sighted telling reuters nothing has been going on the north korean military long a brake on easing relations with the south is by far the most important institution in the impoverished nation north korea 's leader kim jong il has a background in theater and in spy work to cultivate the military he reportedly installed 1000 generals and imposed on the nation an army first policy channeling about one quarter of national spending to the military with 11 million people or 10 percent of the population in arms north korea is the world 's most militarized nation last weekend in north korea 's southeast border region soldiers appeared well fed well clothed and omnipresent stern unsmiling sentries were posted every 50 yards along a 10 mile fenced in route used by south korean tour buses the occasional sight of a broken down jeep or soldiers pushing bicycles down muddy lanes indicated that their equipment was poor on friday at a separate border point a north korean officer accused the united states of moving weapons into the southern sector of the demilitarized zone we have seen armored cars and tanks inside the dmz which is a violation of the armistice because only officers can carry side arms inside the dmz the officer maj kim kwang kil told a reuters reporter who visited the north korean side of panmunjom they have increased the number of soldiers and they are carrying heavy weapons american officials have said there has been no change in the positions of the 37000 american troops on the peninsula in congressional testimony last week defense secretary donald h rumsfeld raised the possibility of shifting american forces away from the zone and removing some of the american troops stationed in the south on monday the united states and south korea announced annual bilateral military exercises in the south the allies said they would hold their exercises from march 19 to 26 a related drill will be held from march 4 to april 2 they said american officials here said the allies had told the north about the war games the north invariably protests the exercises but today 's statement was directed at the prospect of penalties the statement said the united states was planning to bolster its military forces around the peninsula and to conduct naval blockade operations which can be seen only between the warring states during the war and this is little short of an open declaration of war in the long run

 the aftermath of monday 's six hour firefight in this palm studded village 50 miles west of baghdad was an encounter on tuesday with two different countries one was inhabited by an occupying army at war with unseen guerrillas who lay bombs on the roadside and shoot from the cover of citrus groves and stands of corn the other was inhabited by iraqi tribal families who were picking up the pieces of their shattered homes ahmad hassan whose two brothers were arrested by troops of the 82nd airborne division was showing relatives and many other visitors the pile of shrapnel that had shredded the masonry of his house like paperboard crushing a balustrade and setting fire to the upper floors where many of the 54 members of his extended family slept the night before the onslaught as he walked through the detritus of his home he denied that anyone in his family had had anything to do with the attack on an american convoy that sparked a counterattack by tanks helicopters bradley fighting vehicles and infantry we do n't know the people in the resistance said mr hassan whose house and those of his brothers bore the brunt of a combined armor and helicopter assault they come here in cars from all over the country and they chase the americans and shoot them whenever they see them as he spoke cousins were arriving from baghdad and other distant places because they had seen on arab satellite television news that their ancestral village had come under attack we came to see the work of the great liberating army one announced as dozens of tribal elders arranged themselves on plastic chairs in the courtyard to express their sympathy and discuss the sad state of affairs in postwar iraq on the other side of the cultural divide american soldiers in tanks and armored vehicles put up a heavy cordon around the village of qurtan on the edge of this euphrates river town a gunner on an m1 abrams tank shouted down to a reporter i advise you to stay away from our position we are attracting fire this is a very dangerous area as he spoke a mounted convoy of infantry roared up the road through the scatter of houses tucked under the palms after they passed an iraqi roadside soda vendor warned do n't follow that convoy because they are preparing an ambush against it the police chief in this town was assassinated this month for collaborating with american forces and a stubborn underground of iraqi fighters is engaged in a clandestine war to drive american forces from sunni muslim tribal lands that have proved most troublesome for the united states military peace and stability the things that the elders here say they want most seem a distant prospect but as a military spokesman in baghdad said tuesday the low intensity war here is not typical of what is happening in much of postwar iraq the vast majority of the country was calm peaceful and rebuilding lt col george krivo said at a news briefing nonetheless he added the attacks on american forces in recent days show that the complexity and sophistication of the attacks is greater than we have seen in the past colonel krivo said iraqi guerrillas seemed better coordinated and organized in planning their attacks and in general were expanding the range of weapons used from small arms and rocket propelled grenades to mortars and more sophisticated mines and explosives there is a level of expertise that is higher than the average attack in the past he said however we want to be careful not to draw conclusions about why that is so it could be that we are getting down to the more hard core elements of the former regime that are actually out now taking action themselves the ambush on monday began after 9 am when a guerrilla force with small arms and rocket propelled grenade launchers opened fire on a convoy of the 82nd airborne four soldiers were wounded one of whom later died the convoy returned fire and called in reinforcements iraqi witnesses said tuesday that the convoy had been pinned down for some time by the attacking force as reinforcements came colonel krivo said soldiers identified the houses where the attackers took shelter and ordered an attack on them the most heavily damaged houses were those of the hassan brothers who said tuesday that no one had returned fire from their homes all family members fled to the cover of a nearby date palm plantation leaving behind two brothers salih hassan and faisal khalil to watch over the homes both were arrested in a subsequent sweep which colonel krivo said netted 14 suspects during the operation the colonel said observation helicopters arrived to track two men seen escaping from the houses and during the pursuit he added the helicopters came under fire from as many as 20 iraqis a helicopter and an armored vehicle returned fire on another building where the two men had taken cover west of baghdad on monday night an american soldier was killed when his humvee overturned into a canal while responding to a report of a mortar attack at abu ghraib two soldiers were rescued from the canal but a third was still missing the military said early tuesday morning a soldier was slightly wounded after his convoy was attacked in a residential neighborhood in baghdad apparently by an explosive from another vehicle despite the violence which military officials say is concentrated in a few areas american officials announced a loosening of the curfew in the capital the curfew will now begin at midnight rather than 11 pm and will continue to run until 4 am a statement from the military cited recent improvements in security and the reduction of crime as the reason for the easing

 two members of the nassau county legislature jeffrey toback and michael zapson say there 's something rotten in oceanside but neither oceanside residents nor the town of hempstead nor the state department of environmental conservation can agree on what it is or where it 's coming from on june 21 mr toback and mr zapson joined a group of about 40 people at a protest the third last month in front of the waste transfer station owned by the town of hempstead on long beach road in oceanside next to the former oceanside landfill the protesters contend that strong odors have been coming from the station in the last few months some said the place smelled like manure others compared the odor to garbage or rotten eggs the transfer station accepts mostly yard waste like grass clippings and branches brought in by landscapers and yard services and some metal goods like refrigerators the waste and metal are then shipped out in trucks to landfills or recycling plants the transfer station has been operating since 1988 the town denied that there was a problem in a written statement issued last month a town spokesman mike deery took issue with the two legislators in a flier announcing the june 21 protest mr toback and mr zapson had said let 's close the town of hempstead 's oceanside dump facility once and for all mr deery said that by using the word dump people would be misled into thinking that the landfill was still open as he put it in a written statement released last month today 's call for the closing of the oceanside dump is a cynical and shameless attempt by lawmakers seeking re election to mislead residents as to the current status of this facility in fact the oceanside dump has been closed since 1989 mr toback and mr zapson both democrats face republican challengers in november mr deery said later in a telephone interview that the town had received only one formal complaint about odors from the station he added that state department of environmental conservation which issues the permit for the station and inspects it had not cited any violations and had continued to issue it a clean bill of health in its reports he said that the source of the odors might be from recycling companies in oceanside or from a county sewage pumping station a department of environmental conservation spokesman michael fraser agreed that any of these could generate odors and said that the department had stepped up its inspections of all of them to four times a week representatives from the two recycling companies nearest the transfer station and from the county sewage pumping station denied that the smells were coming from them mr zapson whose district includes about 80 percent of oceanside stood pat we believe this is where they 're coming from he said in front of the transfer station at the protest last month i mean you just have to stand here to smell it each time a landscaper 's truck drove through the crowd there was a noticeable manure type smell from the vehicle mr toback a democrat whose district includes 20 percent of oceanside cited two potential odor sources liquid dripping from the landscapers trucks and the storage of yard waste inside the station overnight jeff frank the director of the nature lyceum which teaches organic gardening in westhampton said that the record breaking rainfall this spring might be a factor the rain has made for lush growth which means more grass clippings and when grass clippings start to decompose he said the odor can resemble manure the issue of overnight storage at the transfer station has been a source of some confusion until late last month the department of environmental conservation had maintained that there should be no overnight storage at the transfer station citing a stipulation in its permit that says at the close of business each day all tipping pads shall be free of all debris and swept clean but when the permit was last renewed in december 2002 the department had added a provision that allows up to 2500 tons of waste to be stockpiled a condition the town interpreted to mean that it could be stored overnight on june 27 the department reversed its official position agreeing with the town that overnight storage had been permitted since last december mr fraser the dec spokesman said that the provision was added to give the town more flexibility ideally there would be nothing staying overnight he said but we realize that due to the volume that comes in during their heavy times that some overnight storage is necessary david levy counsel to the town of hempstead said that it was the town 's policy not to store waste overnight and it did so only when a landscaper arrived late in the day after the last truck had left for a landfill or recycling station mr fraser said that recent department records show that the station has stored as little as 10 tons and as much as 400 tons in the last few months he could not say if there were any nights when nothing was stored mr toback the legislator said the fact that no one had complained about this under the old permit and we are complaining about it under the new permit seems to indicate that storage is the problem and they 're in violation of the permit by allowing the odors out meanwhile there seems to be no consensus about the extent of the problem or if there is a problem at all among people who live in oceanside nancy magaddino 65 who lives in oceanside cove a co op apartment complex at daly boulevard and long beach road near the transfer station said i ca n't keep my windows open and i ca n't breathe it stinks to high heaven les and judy gardonyi said they could smell the transfer station at their house about half a mile away you step out in the morning and you get a huge whiff mr gardonyi said at the june 21 protest but marc karp another oceanside resident came to the protest to dissent calling the gathering a political ploy mr karp was the vice president of close the committee to learn organize and save the environment which successfully fought to close the landfill in the 1980 's i 'm objecting to the fact that they 're creating fears and anxiety in the community which are unwarranted he said of the protesters michael raphan a lawyer who lives and practices in oceanside was the president of close he said that he had not noticed any smells i do n't want people in oceanside to begin to think that the landfill is open he said and the garbage dump is being used again
 the families of two east meadow residents who died of west nile virus one four weeks ago and the other yesterday are blaming nassau county for not spraying against infected mosquitoes and say they will sue for wrongful death my father 's dead because they did n't spray charles fink said today we 're definitely going to file a lawsuit his father karl w fink 77 died of complications early thanksgiving morning at winthrop university hospital here after fighting the disease for nine weeks karl fink was hospitalized on the same intensive care ward as the other victim adeline bisignano 71 who died on oct 26 although the two families lived less than a mile apart in east meadow they did not know each other until they became acquainted during hospital visits mrs bisignano 's husband frank expressed similar views if the county would have taken precautions beforehand maybe my wife would have been alive today mr bisignano said it could have been avoided he said he had already consulted a lawyer nassau sprayed insecticide by helicopter in 1999 when the west nile virus first appeared in the new york region and in 2000 did limited spraying by truck in one corner of the county nassau 's decision not to spray this year contrasted with the policies of its neighboring municipalities new york city on the west and suffolk county on the east both of which continued spraying this year six city residents and one from suffolk were sickened but all survived nassau had two other residents who were sickened nassau officials expressed sorrow over the deaths but defended the county 's policy it certainly is a tragedy these two deaths said a health department spokeswoman cynthia d brown after the east meadow cases were diagnosed ms brown said we did increase surveillance in that area but we did n't find evidence of mosquito infestation that was why the county decided against spraying earlier in the season she said we did not find the number of mosquitoes in traps to justify spraying basically it 's a risk assessment ms brown noted that many residents oppose spraying citing fears that the insecticide will harm people or the environment it 's quite a hullabaloo she said but the finks and the bisignanos say that the two east meadow cases should have raised red flags and prompted belated spraying to prevent any further spread of the disease the families said that the two victims both retirees spent nearly all their time at home and were undoubtedly infected there we would like to see this not happen to any other family mr fink said there are still mosquitoes around and we can see them they try to come in when it 's cold i saw one in my car the day before yesterday it 's absolutely wrong not to spray where there is a deadly disease mr bisignano too voiced worries about prevention i could have been bitten he said my neighbors could have been bitten the west nile virus is found in southern europe and much of africa the middle east and south and central asia its arrival in new york in 1999 was its first appearance in north america and it has rapidly spread as far as florida and the midwest the virus is carried by mosquitoes which get it by biting infected animals and spread it by biting uninfected animals migrating birds contribute to the spread of the virus contracting it from mosquitoes in one place and then spreading it to new mosquitoes somewhere else there is no known treatment for west nile virus many humans survive infection with few or no symptoms experts say while some become sick and even develop meningitis or encephalitis most of those who are stricken survive but mortality is higher among the elderly

 more than 34 years ago a prosperous stockbroker named henry scharf parked his green corvette sting ray at kennedy airport on a spring evening boarded a flight to cincinnati under an assumed name and disappeared earlier in the day mr scharf who left a wife and young daughter behind at his home in weston conn testified before a federal grand jury in manhattan that was investigating a 7 million tax fraud scheme several months later mr scharf a 45 year old naturalized citizen who was born in vienna was indicted in absentia on charges that he had conspired to evade taxes on the sale of more than 50 million in foreign stocks three other men charged in the scheme were ultimately convicted and sentenced to federal prison in the days after mr scharf vanished in 1966 his wife filed a missing person 's report and about a year later the internal revenue service issued a wanted bulletin but as the years and decades passed the authorities lost interest in mr scharf and the tax case against him until now kentucky authorities are expected to announce today that dna tests on a body found last april in the sandy clay banks of the ohio river show that the body was that of mr scharf he had been shot once in the back of the head and buried in lime 25 to 35 years ago his skeletal remains had been exposed by flood waters that had eroded the river 's bank where he was buried near fort thomas ky the discovery made on a cool spring night by two 15 year old boys fishing in the river focused attention on a mystery that had been long forgotten and on a case with hints of organized crime and international financial intrigue the discovery also set in motion a modern detective tale an exhaustive investigation by the kentucky authorities who worked for months to learn the identity of the dead man when the remains were first examined the state forensic anthropologist dr emily a craig thought she was dealing with the body of a drifter or a homeless man because she thought a piece of dark blue polyester fabric found with the body was common work clothing but dr craig said in a telephone interview yesterday that she soon learned that the dead man was anything but ordinary despite the passage of time and tree roots that had grown through the skeleton and the clothes the sandy moist ground preserved a lot of material for the investigators the blue fabric it turned out was not from work clothes but from a tailored drip dry suit one that would have been considered out of style by 1970 dr craig was also able to determine that the man had worn knee high lightweight dress socks held in place with garters he had two gold money clips in his pocket one was engraved with the initials h s and a gold a t cross pen and pencil set that had been made between 1965 and 1970 it was still attached to the fabric of his white dress shirt but it was five rusted keys found near the upper part of the dead man 's trousers that led the forensic anthropologist and detective mike daly of the fort thomas police department to begin looking into mr scharf 's case dr craig said there was a 1964 nickel in his pocket and a bunch of keys that were all corroded together she said we used naval jelly wd 40 and good old elbow grease to clean and separate them markings of two locksmiths in fairfield county in connecticut prompted the authorities to seek media coverage in the area about the missing remains and an article in the connecticut post prompted a call to detective daly from a scharf family friend who told them about the missing broker as the investigators began to delve into the missing person 's case on mr scharf and learn about the tax fraud scheme they found that the similarities between their victim and the connecticut man were extraordinary dr craig said the height weight age and build of mr scharf matched a profile they had prepared based on dr craig 's analysis of the remains as did the initials on the money clip and the estimated time of the man 's death and the date of mr scharf 's disappearance while the investigators were unable to find mr scharf 's dental records and his military records burned years ago in a fire at an archive center in st louis they were able to contact his sister and take a dna sample which came back this week matching one taken from the remains dr craig said dr craig said it was an emotional time for mr scharf 's widow and daughter who can finally put their concerns to rest neither of them could be reached for comment as the authorities began reviewing the missing person 's file on mr scharf and the tax fraud case they learned that one old report filed at the time quoted an fbi agent as saying that some of mr scharf 's co defendants had definite connections in the underworld one investigator said some of the reports also had oblique references to ties between the tax case and the mafia and one reported that mr scharf had some connection to loan sharks in new york the investigator said at the same time while investigators have no idea why mr scharf flew to cincinnati the area near where his body was found had been an organized crime haven in the 1950 's and 1960 's when newport ky was a gambling center mr scharf whose case in 1966 was brought by robert m morgenthau who was then the united states attorney for manhattan had been a principal in two firms that had gone bankrupt and in an investment firm that had been barred from dealing securities in 1962 according to securities exchange commission records detective daly said that he was investigating the possibility that organized crime may have played a role in the killing but he said that was just one of several possible motives this is n't a case where we have a smoking gun he said we 've come a long way and there is still a long way to go

 as a guidance counselor at lincoln high school for four years i am deeply disturbed by the article on lincoln turning lincoln around march 12 while lincoln has experienced considerable disruption this year staff and students are also actively engaged in meaningful education daily teachers have been working toward meeting the new educational standards and students are working toward and achieving their goals of high school graduation and higher education however from the opening paragraph the article made it clear that the intended picture of lincoln was purely negative the article referred to last year 's school day which ended at 12 30 pm because it was tailored to meet the teachers needs not the students according to the superintendent of schools in fact last year all ninth graders had classes through the end of eighth period 2 10 pm most but not all upperclassmen had classes periods one through seven and lunch eighth period which allowed them to leave for the day at 1 25 pm the remaining upperclassmen had an early lunch and an eighth period class the teachers day was from 7 45 am to 2 15 pm and many stayed later to work with students it was reasonable to refer to the teachers strike last fall but the student reaction took place at all four high schools not just at lincoln and the staff members who were injured were not hurt by students but in an incident where students were not even present the principal referred to students who have been at lincoln for seven years presumably this is true but as a guidance counselor responsible for 21 percent of the student body for four years i have never had a student who remained at lincoln for six much less seven years in the entire article just 18 lines discussed the positive side there was no mention of the students taking advanced placement classes no mention of the students who struggle to work 30 hour weeks and yet maintain their academics only a brief reference to the fact that over 70 percent of the students who took the english regents exam in january passed and no mention that of the juniors the number was closer to 80 percent perhaps the most destructive and misleading statement was a quote from the vice president of the school board mr weibrecht said when we have children in high school who are n't reading it begs the question how did that kid get here he goes on to imply that teachers are to blame for this i however can vividly recall the eight years i spent as an elementary school counselor when each year teachers would ask that students be held back usually in the primary grades because they needed more time to catch up the answer was always the same central administration would not allow any students to be retained thus students without the basic skills necessary to move on to higher levels were repeatedly pushed up anyway i hope that future articles will discuss in more detail the positive things happening at lincoln and the accomplishments of our students however this article has already done its damage worst of all for our students most of whom are terrific kids who do n't realize just how good they are this article will simply reinforce their already low self esteem susan bryant larchmont
 russia 's use of a dangerous incapacitating gas to knock out chechen terrorists who had seized more than 750 hostages at a moscow theater has underscored the urgent need to develop safer methods to immobilize hostage takers without harming their hostages the powerful gas which was pumped in through the theater 's ventilation system killed at least 116 of the hostages and sent hundreds more to the hospital whether the high death toll was deemed acceptable collateral damage or was the result of a terrible miscalculation is not known russia needs to provide fuller details on the assault and its harm to the hostages such information could help this country and others prepare to deal with future terrorist takeovers the agent used against the chechen terrorists was most likely an aerosol version of a potent fast acting opiate called fentanyl that is used as an anesthetic for horses whatever the specific chemical it falls into the category of incapacitating agents which are supposed to be nonlethal the only trouble is the difference between an incapacitating dose and a lethal dose can be very narrow in hospital operating rooms anesthetics are administered with great care under close monitoring lest too high a dose prove lethal such careful calibration is impossible when the gas must be dispersed in a large area at a dose level strong enough to disable large numbers of people quickly a safer more humane technology is needed in a long search for good incapacitants scientists have investigated chemical and biological agents loud noises microwaves high intensity light and obnoxious odors all have drawbacks that either impede their effectiveness or risk lasting harm to people exposed the federal government is said to be supporting research on nonlethal weapons that could be more effective than the pepper spray and tear gas typically used by police for crowd control but the extent of the effort is murky like any weapon incapacitating agents could be abused perhaps disseminated to quell a peaceful political protest or used to disable people for summary execution as may have happened in moscow some applications may also run afoul of arms control agreements but in an age of terrorism it would surely be desirable to develop a mist that could put people to sleep quickly without harming them permanently this is an area that congress needs to explore more fully for homeland defense

 secretary of state colin l powell said today that opposition around the world toward the war in iraq would pose a significant challenge for the united states in the future and that he never expected it would be as easy as some had thought to break the hold of saddam hussein 's government mr powell said that to counter global antiwar sentiments the united states would seek a major role for the united nations in a democratic postwar iraq move more aggressively to restart the israeli palestinian peace talks and reach out to friends with whom we may have been having some difficulty once we have been successful and we have prevailed and people realize that we have come to provide a better life for the people of iraq mr powell added i think you can turn this rather quickly the secretary 's comments came in a wide ranging interview much of it focused on his reflections about the war and the comments of some commanders and analysts that the current level of forces was not sufficient to win the war mr powell a former army general who was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has propounded the so called powell doctrine that war must be waged with overwhelming or at least decisive force asked whether the united states had fielded such a level of force mr powell demurred i think that they will bring decisive force to bear he said but what i do n't want to do is start commenting on the ups and downs the ins and outs of the daily battle but he explained that in anticipation of an adverse situation after the first week the pentagon had queued up lots of forces in anticipation that you may not know in the first week or so what the total requirement would be and that 's why there are forces that are still now flowing into the theater the secretary declined to say whether he had taken part in the debate with the president over what the size of the force should be i do n't discuss options that were presented to the president which were accepted which were discarded he said i defend the president 's positions and decisions in discussing the future of postwar iraq mr powell provided new details on the administration 's thinking his pledge for a big role by the united nations echoed prime minister tony blair at his joint news conference with president bush at camp david on thursday mr bush did not mention the united nations and some in the administration make no secret of their opposition to its playing a role particularly in any reconstruction of iraq the united nations has made it clear through the secretary general they do not want to become the new governing authority of iraq mr powell said but they have a role to play in many different ways he said the united nations was needed to provide international legitimacy to the occupation with a mischievous grin and a linguistic bow to france the major foe of the war the secretary then offered two metaphors for what he said washington wanted first he said the united nations would serve as a chapeau the french word for hat conferring broad legitimacy and endorsement of iraq 's postwar operations including some of its reconstruction second it would serve as a vessel receiving funds from aid groups and those financing iraq 's reconstruction as a practical matter mr powell said without some kind of international legitimacy iraq under an american  and british led occupation would not be able to produce currency that would be recognized by other countries or sell oil on the international market on the other hand he made clear that the military would have to be in charge at least at first so long as the situation in iraq remained unstable we 're the ones who are doing the fighting and the liberating with our friends in the coalition he said we believe we have an important role to play and to some extent drive this process until such time as there is an iraqi government that is functioning and running on other subjects mr powell took exception to many accounts suggesting that the administration 's so called preemption strategy contained in its national security strategy published last year meant that mr bush might use or threaten force against north korea and iran as the next stage of its policies noting that newspapers had written much about this strategy as guiding the iraq war and possible future confrontations mr powell said give me the evidence for this point of view just because there is a war with iraq that does n't mean we 're going to a war footing as soon as iraq is dealt with he said the president has available to him lots of tools and the tool you use is not always a hammer he added mr powell disputed news accounts of the administration 's actions once again when he said it was wrong to say that the effort to try to get a second security council resolution authorizing use of force against iraq was a mistake or a setback rather he said the effort had been closer to succeeding than was generally acknowledged but the united states let some countries willing to support the american position off the hook once it became clear that france was going to kill the resolution with a veto when we looked at that and realized the position this was putting some of our friends in he said and have them show their hand and still lose at that point it was sensible not to do that that 's diplomacy sometimes he also said the effort to get a second resolution enabled mr blair to quiet a revolt within his party over going to war in talking about all the predictions of quick success in iraq whether from surrender popular uprising or resignation by mr hussein he seemed more reflective than irritated over the many predictions that the war would go more easily than it has you know you may have to go and take a census of everybody but i had no illusions he said we all hoped for the best but you plan for not the best reminded that some had talked about the war being a cakewalk or rout the secretary said you can search my speakings and writings for years i never used expressions or terms or words like that war is not a game and it 's not a slogan these are young men and women who are being sent to their to their fate
 the charles atlas of algae diatoms algae that are major components of plankton are proof that small is beautiful their silica shells called frustules are exquisitely ornamented symmetrical structures but a diatom is more than just a pretty face its frustule is a form of armor that can protect the diatoms from predators just how much protection the typical diatom frustule offers has been determined by scientists in germany who performed load tests on several species engineers perform these kinds of tests all the time putting thousands of pounds of pressure on an aircraft part say until it breaks the diatom tests were the same but since diatoms are on the order of 100 microns in diameter very tiny amounts of force were applied using a microscopic glass needle the researchers writing last month in the journal nature say the three species tested broke at forces ranging from about 100 to 700 micronewtons this is equivalent to a weight of about 150 to 1000 pounds per square inch not bad for a single celled organism the researchers also studied the shells using finite element analysis a technique that involves breaking down a structure into many elements whose behavior can be described by a set of equations that can be solved by a computer they found that most frustules have circumferential bands called girdles that help absorb stress and contribute to the shells remarkable strength ravages of the reef some of the effects of human settlement on nature are immediate and obvious an acre of forest cleared for agriculture for example is one less acre of habitat for other species but other effects are more subtle and long term a case in point is what has happened on the great barrier reef in australia where human settlement with its attendant land clearing cattle grazing mining and other activities has affected water quality agriculture industry and development lead to increased erosion and the eroded sediments can harm coral by blocking light and interfering with feeding the extent of the problem however has never been clear now australian researchers have shown that sediments in one part of the reef have increased 5 to 10 times since europeans began settling the area in the 1860 's the researchers describing their work last month in the journal nature used the coral itself in an area known as havannah reef as a marker for sediment concentration the sediments contain an element barium that is incorporated into coral skeletons as they grow since coral growth can be traced year by year as a tree 's age can be gauged by rings the researchers were able to track how the amount of sediment changed by analyzing barium concentration over the years from about 1750 to 1870 sediments reached the study area only rarely in huge floods along the burdekin river after 1870 however barium concentrations increased markedly within just a decade of europeans arrival in the region the researchers say there was already an effect on the reef waters one that continues to this day steps for the galapagos in january 2001 the delicate and historic ecosystem that is the galapagos islands had a close call a tanker ran aground near the islands and leaked most of its 240000 gallons of fuel oil although the damage was limited most of the oil evaporated and only a few animals died conservationists realized it could have been much worse hoping to avoid future disasters the ecuadorean government signed an agreement last weekend with wwf the conservation group formerly called the world wildlife fund and a local group to develop a renewable energy program for the archipelago the plan calls for cleaner motors for boats that frequent the islands and replacing diesel power plants with renewable sources like wind and solar power observatory correction march 14 2003 friday an illustration with the observatory column in science times on tuesday about the strength of the shells of diatoms single celled algae that are a major component of plankton depicted a different type of marine plankton it showed another single cell type a coccolithophorid which is spherical

 india chastened by its disastrous intervention more than a decade ago in the brutish war that has long plagued sri lanka its island neighbor to the south is nonetheless gingerly stepping back into a conflict that has once again reached a crisis stage officials here continue to say india will not send in its own troops or supply arms to sri lanka which is battling separatist ethnic tamil rebels but the defense minister and the national security adviser have suggested in recent days that the indian navy is prepared to evacuate 30000 sri lankan troops at the request of the sri lankan government under certain conditions a spokesman for india 's ministry of defense pramod bhatnagar said in an interview tuesday that the navy had two large ships standing by to evacuate troops and civilians from the jaffna peninsula a small finger of land just miles from india 's southern coast though only if a cease fire is declared between the government and the rebels the moment we receive an order we will go into action he said it will be essentially a peace mission at this point the sri lankan government is not ready to withdraw and turn over the city of jaffna in the tamil dominated north of this majority sinhalese nation to the rebels but the boastful declarations of military and political leaders that the country would fight to the last man to defend jaffna are sounding more tentative as the fighting continues to rage the sri lankan president chandrika kumaratunga said in an interview published today in the hindu a national indian newspaper that the military still holds two thirds of the jaffna peninsula but added that the rebels are putting up a very determined fight withdrawal she said does not seem a possibility at this moment military analysts and western diplomats say they doubt that the government can hold on indefinitely even though its troops outnumber the rebels by 6 to 1 the sri lankan military has been weakened by a highly politicized command structure a demoralized rank and file and planes that do n't fly they say mrs kumaratunga herself acknowledged shortcomings in the military strategy in contrast the rebels who call themselves the liberation tigers of tamil eelam have proved to be a motivated expertly led force that is ruthlessly focused on winning a homeland for the country 's tamil minority and is financially supported by a large tamil diaspora india which has it own chronic secessionist problem in kashmir has a tortured history in the sri lankan conflict in the 1980 's under prime minister indira gandhi india which has a huge tamil population in its south covertly armed and trained separatist tamil militants from sri lanka and allowed them to set up bases in the southern indian state of tamil nadu sri lankan historians see mrs gandhi 's meddling in the affairs of sri lanka as a cynical effort to court political support among tamils in southern india and to assert india 's dominance over its smaller neighbor but india succeeded only in helping to unleash a war that has taken more than 60000 lives and has entangled india itself rajiv gandhi who succeeded his assassinated mother as prime minister sent in indian troops in 1987 with the aim of quickly imposing a settlement of the ethnic conflict at its peak more than 75000 indian troops were on sri lankan soil almost three years later india pulled out with none of its aims achieved and more than 1000 of its men killed in 1991 mr gandhi who was then out of office and campaigning to regain his post was assassinated by a suicide bomber from the tigers one of the guerrilla groups india had trained the conspirators in his murder have been sentenced to death and the tigers banned in india sri lanka itself said good riddance when india departed in 1990 but 10 years later facing a renewed onslaught from the tigers it has turned to india for military assistance mrs kumaratunga alluded to india 's moral responsibility in her interview with the hindu noting that it was india that supported the terrorists on their soil gave them not just refuge but arms and training so that they could come back and start the war she said india should now be using its influence to bring the tigers to the negotiating table sri lankan officials have been meeting with a delegation from norway over the past three days that is trying to facilitate peace talks between the government and the rebels that broke off five years ago india as well as the united states and other western nations have taken the position that the conflict can only be resolved through negotiation and that the solution should preserve the territorial integrity of sri lanka while granting greater autonomy to the tamils india which is deeply embroiled in a conflict with anti india guerrillas to its north in the state of kashmir can not afford to encourage tamil nationalists in south india by countenancing the creation of a separate tamil nation in sri lanka for now though the immediate crisis is a military one in the jaffna peninsula the tigers controlled the city of jaffna from 1990 to 1995 lost it to the government for the past five years and claim they are moving closer to recapturing it there are fears that the tigers who are infamous for assassinating their tamil rivals and other political leaders will kill many civilians whom they consider government collaborators the american state department has categorized the tigers as a terrorist organization fighting has been raging in the north in recent days but it is difficult to know what is happening on the ground the government has banned reporters from the battle zone and imposed severe censorship on the press in the past week it has closed two newspapers for defying the censor the sunday leader a weekly newspaper based in colombo and udayan jaffna 's tamil newspaper the coverage of the crisis has been largely reduced to regurgitating press releases issued by the government if the time comes when the government has to withdraw from jaffna sri lankans may well be unprepared for the defeat that would prove politically costly for president kumaratunga 's party which faces parliamentary elections by october no one knows how long the government can hang on in jaffna it has been buying arms and aircraft from abroad to resupply the men fighting there kingsley de silva a historian who is executive director of the international center for ethnic studies in kandy sri lanka said he believes mrs kumaratunga will try to hold on militarily in jaffna until after the elections if at all possible i do not think the government can survive if there is a massive evacuation he said
 kevin compton a 48 year old grain farmer recently walked into his corn field to inspect the damage from a summer long drought he tore open an ear of corn and grimaced look at this little bitty ear he said revealing a stunted partly rotted corn cob this wo n't amount to nothing everything 's gone mr compton then hopped in his ford explorer and drove a mile east to inspect some soybean acreage it was even worse you see these spots he said fingering a withering pale green soybean pod these are dying when you look at these pods you see about 8 or 10 normally you 'd have 30 or 40 farmers all over the state are making similar assessments because of what state officials say is one of the worst droughts in the plains states in decades this community in northeastern kansas is one of the areas hit hardest for the second straight year kansas and parts of missouri and nebraska have suffered through an extremely dry summer that has brought back memories of the 1930 's dust bowl a shortage of rainfall and a series of 100 degree days have destroyed crops on millions of acres and dried up streams creeks and rivers state officials said all over kansas there have been scenes of loss and despair farmers have been harvesting corn that matured too early and turning it into animal feed ranchers have been hauling water to cattle grazing on shriveled pastures even grain sorghum which is considered more drought resistant than other crops is dying in the fields recent downpours that flooded the eastern part of the state came too late to save many crops state and agriculture officials said the rains were beneficial but they did n't save anything said mary knapp the kansas state climatologist we need continuing rains to end this some farmers have had to take drastic steps farmers are cutting their corn for silage because it 's not good enough to grow said lisa taylor a spokeswoman for the kansas department of agriculture farmers had hoped this year would be better than last when they lost more than 1 billion worth of crops to drought the losses could be as high this year congress offered about 200 million in drought aid in 2002 this year state officials are planning to ask the federal government for more relief indeed the united states agriculture department 's weather crop report recently showed that about 55 percent of the state 's corn crop and 61 percent of its soybean crop were poor to very poor one of the few bright spots for kansas farmers was last winter 's wheat crop which resulted in an unusually good harvest many farmers who expect huge losses from this summer 's corn and soybean crops are hoping for another strong winter wheat crop which is planted in october and harvested in june there is already a rush to buy seed for winter wheat agricultural officials here say kansas ranchers are also faring well by selling their cattle early to take advantage of a strong demand for beef market prices are extremely good said todd domer a spokesman for the kansas livestock association they 're near all time highs the pessimistic report from the department of agriculture came at the end of august when parts of kansas were suffering through 11 consecutive days of 100 degree heat on day 12 the temperature was 99 parts of kansas were so dry that restrictions on water use and rules against trash burning were put into effect to conserve water and prevent wildfires some reservoirs were 14 to 20 feet below normal levels along interstate 70 which stretches in this state from kanorado near the colorado border east to kansas city there are dying trees acres of stunted soybeans and fields of deformed earless corn corn fields that typically average 150 bushels an acre are now yielding just 30 or 40 local farmers say the harvest began weeks ahead of schedule because farmers wanted to salvage part of the corn here in the northeastern part of the state the remaining corn is so brittle that a recent wind storm knocked over huge fields of it soybean farmers are not much better off many soybean crops look as though they have stopped growing altogether the dark greens have gone pale like some tree tops this is the second year in a row said kenlon johannes a spokesman for the kansas soybean association it was bad in 2000 2001 was ok 2002 was bad and this year is bad three out of the last four years have been tough after going nearly two months with little or no precipitation people in kansas were joking that they would not know rain if it hit them smack on the head rain what 's rain said stanley mccauley a farmer driving a pickup truck on main street in nearby highland just before the downpours at ernie 's restaurant and pool hall in downtown highland everyone had something to say about the weather people are driving trucks up and down the nemaha river said artie lucas an insurance agent who was eating chicken strips and potatoes that 's a tributary of the missouri river someone in the crowded hall called on wilbur winter 87 to comment on the drought mr winter a retired farmer sought to put things in historical perspective i remember '36 he said that was the dust bowl we had 36 days over 100 degree temperatures this is n't as bad as then but this is bad in a state dominated by farmers and the business of farming the drought has rippled through the economy everyone 's tightening up said emmett cole who operates a grain and fertilizer business in highland they 've quit spending money and they 're cutting back on their farm inputs while the rains came too late for the summer crop they could

 democratic gains in the house and senate on tuesday fell short of control but produced the most narrowly divided congress in almost half a century democrats gained at least three senate seats and one or two in the house with one senate race undecided republicans had 50 seats and democrats 49 in the house republicans won an apparent majority of 221 to 211 with 2 independents and one seat undecided with the democratic candidate leading but republicans asserted that recounts or absentee ballots would give them two or three of the seats where democrats now had more votes and democrats predicted that a recount would get them one republican seat the last time both houses were so closely divided was at the end of the 83rd congress of 1953 55 when republicans ended with a 49 to 46 senate edge with 1 independent and the house had 219 republicans 215 democrats and 1 independent but that was an entirely different era when lawmakers drank and golfed together and when blunt partisanship as seen in today 's attack advertisements was almost unheard of a widely recalled saying of the time has a senior democrat correcting a freshman who called house republicans the enemy the elder democrat explained the republicans are the opposition the senate is the enemy there were some bows to the older spirit yesterday senator john ashcroft of missouri the republican who was narrowly beaten by the late mel carnahan after his widow agreed to accept appointment if he won rejected any legal challenge to the result saying i believe that the will of the people has been expressed with compassion and the will of the people should be respected but more typical was the sort of call for bipartisanship made by senator robert g torricelli of new jersey head of the democrats senate campaign committee republicans must recognize mr torricelli said that there is no constituency in this country for stopping progress on prescription drugs or hiring new teachers or defeating the building of new schools senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky who heads the senate republican campaign committee brushed off mr torricelli 's call for new campaign finance legislation saying democrats would love to cripple the parties because they have allies in the afl cio and the sierra club similarly representative thomas m davis iii of virginia head of the house republican campaign committee said cooperation was possible if democrats abandoned their recent stands the democratic leadership did not want the house republicans to get credit for anything mr davis said i think they were willing to kill a pretty good deal and not get anything i hope that will end he also taunted democrats by saying that a few of their members whom he did not name had talked to him about switching parties the senate results followed a pattern widely anticipated in recent weeks democrats won five republican seats defeating incumbents in delaware michigan minnesota and missouri and winning the republican seat in florida opened up by connie mack 's retirement they could still win one more because several thousand absentee ballots in washington state may overcome senator slade gorton 's current 3197 vote margin and give the seat to maria cantwell a former democratic representative but even if ms cantwell wins and the senate is divided 50 to 50 republicans would be in control if gov george w bush of texas is elected his vice president dick cheney would cast a tie breaking 101st vote to give republicans control if vice president al gore wins senator joseph i lieberman re elected to the senate on tuesday would resign to become vice president and a republican would be appointed to succeed him breaking the tie republicans held on to the majority they won in 1994 by taking the democratic seat in nevada that was vacated by the retirement of richard bryan and by ousting senator charles s robb the two term democrat in virginia democrats retained several seats that had been jeopardized by retirements in new york new jersey and nebraska republicans held on in one tough race in which senator conrad burns of montana overcame a challenge that was largely focused on the prescription drug issue a comparable even stronger fire wall preserved republican control of the house republicans aimed at and won seats opened up by democratic retirements in michigan missouri pennsylvania virginia and west virginia and by the defeat of representative michael forbes democrat of long island in the primary republicans also defeated two incumbents who had not been serious targets early representatives sam gejdenson in connecticut and david minge in minnesota jim wilkinson a spokesman for the republican campaign committee said yesterday that republicans were confident that further counting would erase the 56 vote lead held last night by representative rush d holt a democrat in new jersey democrats had singled out republicans in florida illinois ohio and pennsylvania but in the end they took only one republican seat east of the mississippi that seat was vacated by representative rick a lazio who lost new york 's senate race to hillary rodham clinton they picked up five seats in california one was easy for no republican was running in the 31st district which had swung to the republicans only briefly when representative matthew g martinez switched parties after losing the democratic primary three republican incumbents lost in california representatives james e rogan brian p bilbray and steven t kuykendall representative jay dickey of arkansas also lost and four democrats won seats vacated by retiring republicans they were jim matheson in utah brad carson in oklahoma rick larsen in washington and mike honda in california democrats also said they hoped recounts would give elaine bloom a victory in florida over representative e clay shaw jr and do the same for dianne byrum a michigan state senator who held a victory party before the final count favored mike rogers the republican candidate representative richard a gephardt of missouri the minority leader who would have become speaker had the democrats won held out hope yesterday for an eventual democratic gain of up to four seats mr gephardt also told reporters he had called speaker j dennis hastert to congratulate him the two men had not spoken since june those months of silence reflect the difference between attitudes today and the last time the congress was so narrowly divided in the old days said norman j ornstein a congressional scholar at the american enterprise institute in washington partisanship existed and did not dominate the congress he said political fights then were local you did n't have tom davis or bob torricelli putting together ads to be used across the country to condemn candidates sometimes for taking positions that mr davis or mr torricelli themselves supported what this does is to create a bitterness among people who get elected against the party itself and not just the guy who runs against you
 only a handful of the books first published in london in the sober year of 1653 are still read today even by scholars and only one of that year 's first editions has gone on over the next three and a half centuries to be reprinted again and again and to find new readers every year that book is izaak walton 's the compleat angler or the contemplative man 's recreation being a discourse of fish and fishing not unworthy the perusal of most anglers there is hardly any assessing how different our world is from walton 's from 2003 1653 looks like a vastly simpler time if only because there were fewer lawyers as walton puts it but simplicity is always deceiving the compleat angler was published just five years after england had hung its king and brought civil war to an end under the puritan rule of oliver cromwell yet what walton asks is simply this is it not an art to deceive a trout with an artificial fly he asks it not as a scholar of angling sitting in a musty room filled with old books and tackle but in the persona of piscator the fisherman who teaches venator the hunter how to fish during a beautiful outing in may and what makes walton interesting even now is that the art of being an angler was far more complex in his day than it is in ours walton 's kind of fisherman had to be able to discourse on pliny and to quote st augustine and to consider the analogies between his art and that of the fishers of men who were called apostles his angler needed to be able to sing as well as bait a hook or tie a fly he should revel in the pleasures of the countryside and the companionship of other anglers venator soon qualifies as a fisherman not just because he catches fish but also because he has a genuine delicacy of soul let 's go to that house venator says at the end of the day for the linen looks white and smells of lavender and i long to lie in a pair of sheets that smell so if to us piscator sounds didactic and a little long winded praising water for instance because it allows the english to travel easily to rome venator 's patience is only magnified as a result it is indeed an art to deceive a trout with an artificial fly now as well as then but by art walton means something much more inclusive than technique as the two men walk along in the shade of a honeysuckle hedge piscator turns from the technical matter of painting a fly rod to a question of much greater importance thankfulness fishing may be a contemplative person 's recreation but it 's even more fitting for a person who has also taught himself to be thankful piscator 's by word in a world full of suffering is simply this every misery that i miss is a new mercy to tie your own flies gather your own bait make your own tackle to sing well to quote learnedly to know the seasons of the trout and which winds are preferable for fishing to love the scent of lavender in an ale house window to fish thankfully   these are just the beginnings of the angler 's duties in walton 's eyes he lived in a time when a fisherman might hate otters still common then for destroying trout but even walton knew that the love of his sport meant first of all a care for nature which we believe too often at our peril can take care of itself i remember he wrote that a wise friend of mine did usually say 'that which is everybody 's business is nobody 's business our business after all this time has passed is still to learn from walton editorial observer correction may 28 2003 wednesday an editorial observer published on saturday about izaak walton mistakenly asserted that charles i had been executed by hanging he was beheaded in 1649 four years not five before the publication of the compleat angler

 as stars of the show athletes gathering here for the winter olympics want for nothing that includes condoms they are free for the asking where athletes live and where they compete in many places it would not be a big deal vital for safe sex condoms are distributed by cities and school systems all across the country they have been provided at every olympics since 1992 including the summer games of 2000 in sydney australia where more than 70000 condoms in a rainbow of colors were distributed to athletes some countries exhausted their supply but here in utah a conservative and largely mormon state that requires parents to give written permission for their children to attend classes when human sexuality and reproduction are discussed the availability of free condoms is a big deal big enough that generation life an anti abortion group promoting sexual abstinence before marriage plans five days of protests during the olympics which start next friday brandi swindell the group 's director said we want to expose the horrific realities of abortion tie in our message of chastity and tell people that condoms are not that safe it is the kind of message that city officials worry might spoil the enjoyment for some olympic visitors even if the more conservative residents of the state agree with ms swindell 's position state senator bill wright a republican who represents one of the most conservative areas in utah a region south of provo criticized olympic leaders and by extension athletes for a program that he contended conveyed a cavalier approach to sex it 's atrocious that the organizing committee has come to this mr wright said through a spokesman they should be mature adults who represent their countries in an honest and respectful manner i do n't think this is the way to do it vania grandi a spokeswoman for the organizing committee said an olympic sponsor cardinal health inc of dublin ohio had donated the 12000 condoms that would be available free in clinics at the 10 competition sites and the complex where the athletes would live we 're not distributing them ms grandi said they 're available like aspirin tylenol and bandages it 's good public health policy mr wright has been a leading force in the state to tighten laws that make utah one of the most restrictive states in the nation in how sex education is taught in public schools in every school district parents are asked to designate subjects they do not want their children learning about in the classroom including sexual abstinence human reproduction reproductive anatomy physiology marriage pregnancy childbirth parenthood contraception and sexually transmitted diseases in addition state law prohibits the classroom discussion of other sex related subjects including contraceptive methods intercourse homosexuality and erotic behavior an aide to mr wright said the senator intended to introduce legislation this year that would shift control of sex education to local school boards to give parents even more control over what their children were taught efforts like those ms swindell said convinced her that many local residents would support her group 's message at the olympics with conservatives this absolutely resonates vicky l dahn director of curriculum and educational technology for the state office of education said of the opposition to the condoms they firmly believe in abstinence before marriage in their minds there is no gray area but others in the salt lake area applaud olympic organizers for the condom program describing it as a good public health policy and proper use of athletes as role models they strongly believe condoms promote promiscuity karrie galloway chief executive of planned parenthood of utah said of the state 's powerful conservative lawmakers the saddest part is that responsible use of contraception prevents abortion and decreases the likelihood of unintended pregnancies but they do n't teach that in the schools most of the 3500 olympic athletes from 84 countries are staying in dormitories at the university of utah several miles from downtown salt lake city some of them are quite young including two 16 year old women who are members of the united states team lyndsay walls of churchville ny a hockey player and sarah hughes of great neck ny a figure skater for security the athletes quarters known as the olympic village are fenced off from the general population but organizers have provided everything for them including game rooms restaurants a health center where condoms are free and a store where they can be purchased several athletes said this week that they believed that providing free condoms made sense because most of olympic athletes were young and unmarried and many were sexually active nikola sudova 19 a free style skier from the czech republic said her sport was populated by many athletes her age who tended to be friends more than lovers but maybe it is a good thing she said stefan georgiev 24 an alpine skier from bulgaria said you have people from so many nations here not only america it would be better if they use condoms vuk radjenovic 18 a member of yugoslavia 's bobsled team eagerly endorsed the condom policy it 's a very good idea a very very good idea he said today is a very nasty time for diseases and there will be a lot of parties in the olympic village i suppose it 's a natural thing sex but you must be careful
 to the editor re restarting the mideast peace clock editorial june 29 yasir arafat 's apparent inability or unwillingness to enforce his will on every teenage stone thrower and every suicide bomber as well as israel 's frustration with his efforts underscores the inherent difficulties with the infirm peace process the oslo accords were meant to deal with a conflict between two peoples but in reality the palestinian people have never fully endorsed the concept of peaceful coexistence with the people of israel they continue to teach their children the rhetoric of hate and the glory of the jihad while their leader plays the diplomat in an attempt to turn world opinion against his partner in peace until the palestinian people and their leaders speak with a united voice of peace and cooperation the peace process will remain unrewarding for both sides eric jay wolf new york june 29 2001
 in the face of strong and growing opposition the japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi expressed strong support today for the united states ultimatum to president saddam hussein of iraq to leave his country within 48 hours or face war now that it is determined that the extremely dangerous regime of hussein has no intention to disarm i believe it appropriate to support america 's use of force mr koizumi told a news conference tuesday mr koizumi 's foreign minister yoriko kawaguchi reinforced the japanese government 's message on tuesday in a meeting with iraq 's interim charge d'affaires qasim shakir if iraq paves the way for the abolition of its weapons of mass destruction with the exile of president hussein the iraqi people will be able to avoid damage stemming from military action ms kawaguchi was quoted as telling the envoy prime minister koizumi made it clear that because of the constitutional constraints japan will not participate in any military action against iraq said hatsuhisa takashima a foreign ministry spokesman however the government of japan will make a thorough study on how to help the rehabilitation and reconstruction of postwar iraq and contribute to international peace and stability while making utmost efforts to secure the safety of japanese nationals and to prevent any economic disruption japan 's support of american policy toward iraq has scarcely been in doubt here but with his public opinion ratings plummeting and opposition to the war rising mr koizumi had always been careful to hedge his statements recently he said that japan 's response to any american attack on iraq would depend on the climate of the moment a kyodo news agency poll conducted saturday and sunday put the prime minister 's support at 41 percent his lowest ever of the respondents 53 percent said the government should not back an attack on iraq another kyodo survey suggested that 68 percent of the country 's legislators did not support an attack regardless of whether a united nations resolution authorizing war was adopted numerous recent polls here have shown that over 80 percent of japanese oppose washington 's threatened use of force in iraq japan 's streets have grown lively with antiwar protests despite public opinion against the war mr koizumi said that no additional security council resolution would be necessary before the expected attack on iraq because past resolutions had already legitimized the use of force to disarm iraq

 as he walked to meet tiger woods at the driving range this morning butch harmon was asked if woods expects to contend every week harmon laughed at the question tiger does n't expect to contend every week said harmon woods 's only coach since turning professional contending is n't good enough we expect to win every time we tee it up now you have to be realistic winning is not always going to happen but he 's driven to be the best with him it 's not about money it 's not about fame it 's about being the best there ever was that 's the challenge and everything he does is directed toward that goal to do it you need longevity and only time will tell but winning is always the focus the focus will remain on woods beginning thursday when he attempts to win his sixth consecutive start on the pga tour at the att pebble beach national pro am only two players in tour history have won more than five consecutive starts byron nelson who won an incredible 11 consecutive starts in 1945 and ben hogan who won six consecutive starts in 1948 woods has played down his current streak because it has stretched over two calendar years and because he did not win the johnnie walker classic last november in taiwan nor the williams world challenge in january those were not official tour events however so until woods loses on tour he can expect scenes like today when more than 50 reporters surrounded him following his practice round at pebble beach the streak may not motivate woods but winning does i do n't know what competitor likes finishing second said woods who will be playing for the first time in three weeks since winning the mercedes championships last month in hawaii my ultimate goal is to win and anything short of that i 'm always going to be disappointed born and reared in california woods would love to win at pebble beach one of the world 's most picturesque courses he came close to winning the tournament in 1997 when he tied for second place with david duval one stroke behind the winner mark o'meara woods made a dramatic weekend charge in '97 shooting a third round 63 and a final round 64 which nearly erased a seven stroke deficit on sunday needing an eagle on pebble beach 's famous par 5 18th hole to tie o'meara woods reached the green with a 3 wood from 267 yards on his second shot but he just missed a 35 foot putt that would have tied him for first that experience gives woods even more confidence heading into this weekend as if he needs more confidence his victory in hawaii was a classic ernie els played superbly in hawaii and against anyone else it probably would have been enough to win but it was n't enough to beat woods both els and woods made eagle at no 18 to force a playoff but woods ended the duel two holes later making a phenomenal 40 foot putt for birdie els left wondering what else he could have done woods left with another dramatic victory can woods top last year when he won nine times worldwide and eight times on the tour harmon would not rule it out i think you 're going to see him get a lot better this year harmon said he hit 71 percent of his fairways last year and we 'd like to get that up to 75 his bad shots are going to get less erratic his swing is continuing to improve he may not win 10 times but he 's going to play better golf the weather is usually a factor at pebble beach where strong winds and rain are commonplace but woods dealt with strong winds effectively in hawaii using a low trajectory 3 wood shot off the tee that he has worked on during the past year if the wind blows this week woods will actually welcome it it separates a lot of players said woods referring to the wind you have to focus a little bit harder grind it out some of the guys do n't want to be out there woods will play thursday at poppy hills one of three courses on which the tournament is held on friday woods moves to spyglass hill before playing both saturday and sunday at pebble beach jerry chang who played with woods on stanford 's golf team will be his amateur playing partner woods was supposed to play with michael jordan who pulled out after accepting his new front office position with the washington wizards he 's got a job said woods laughing about jordan he ca n't get off work even though he 's the boss but on the golf course woods believes he is the boss and he hoped to drive home that point again this week winning at pebble would mean a lot said woods i have played great weekend rounds here i just need to get off to a better start

 to the editor the aug 16 article design and dissent roil ivy clubhouse about the dispute over additions to the harvard club says it all the issues facing the club are multifaceted many of them having little to do with design communication is as much at issue here as whether a contemporary addition is more palatable than a faux neo georgian pastiche as an architect who has worked on both the 1986 scheme of edward larrabee barnes and now davis brody bond 's i can note that it would be unrealistically optimistic to expect that a design could be met with unanimous approval of a client whose membership exceeds 11000 but the new york city landmarks preservation commission has found that the proposed addition will enhance the special architectural character of the harvard club and the special architectural and historic character of the other landmark buildings within the streetscape of this block steve fisher the writer is a senior associate at davis brody bond in new york

 92nd street y the canadian period instrument ensemble tafelmusik devoted its tuesday evening program at the 92nd street y to concertos by handel bach and vivaldi and a suite of short sonatas sinfonias and dances by salamone rossi handel was given pride of place with his concerto grosso in g op 3 no 3 and the ensemble led from the violin by its music director jeanne lamon gave the work a robust but surprisingly plain reading so much more could have been done with balances within the group and there were times when the energetic string playing became strident and oboe intonation went awry but perhaps the band was sizing up the hall in the bach concerto for oboe d'amore in g reconstructed by ms lamon using movements from bwv 100 170 and 30 john abberger 's performance of the solo line was on target and the string playing was decidedly more rounded rossi who flourished in mantua at the turn of the 17th century is best known for his monteverdi like settings of hebrew prayer texts the instrumental pieces in tafelmusik 's suite were composed for use at the mantuan court and because they were written on the cusp of the baroque era some sing in the accents of the renaissance style and some draw on newer techniques particularly intriguing was a sonata for four violins in which two pairs of fiddles debated antiphonally the rossi was beautifully played but the ensemble 's best and most supple work was in the four vivaldi concertos offered after the intermission among them was a lively account of a bassoon concerto rv 483 with dominic teresi playing the solo line gracefully and a zesty concerto for two cellos in which christina mahler and allen whear were the able soloists allan kozinn
 suddenly south koreans are enthralled with all things north korean since the two nations vowed to pursue peace and reconciliation last week sales clerks at the vast kyobo bookstore in central seoul have been working overtime to meet an explosive demand here for books about north korea and communism across the street department stores and fashion outlets have been selling out of sunglasses and drab worker 's uniforms similar to those that north korea 's leader kim jong il wore at the talks in pyongyang with the south korean president kim dae jung and at a nearby samsung consumer electronics store the company 's first color television assembled in north korea went on sale today to rave reviews recent public opinion polls show that a majority of south koreans surveyed now have a good impression of north korea and its leader after the talks social commentators here are calling south korea 's new fascination with its estranged northern neighbor an unexpected case of kim jong il fever but whatever the diagnosis the summit meeting last week has forced south koreans to reassess the decades old cold war view of north korea as a mortal enemy in high school we were taught that north koreans were all communists and therefore very bad and dangerous people cho jae hyung 17 said as he flipped through titles like will spring come to pyongyang a very special leader kim jong il and che guevara at the bookstore but i saw kim jong il on television and he seemed like a very modern practical and intelligent man mr cho said now i 'm not sure what to believe about north korea but i know that what i was told in the past is not exactly the truth for many south koreans especially older people who lived through the korean war overcoming a half century of deeply ingrained fear and animosity toward north korea will not come easy many south koreans were stunned and confused by the abrupt thawing of relations between the two countries which agreed to cease aggression on the korean peninsula and forge economic and other ties especially puzzling for many south koreans is mr kim the north korean leader who they were long told was a reclusive bellicose dictator but for many he came across on television as a warm gracious and charismatic host during the pyongyang talks many south koreans remain uncertain whether to embrace north korea as a long lost brother or reject it as a charlatan preying on their sensibilities overhearing a reporter 's request to a shopping mall vendor for kim jong il sunglasses which have a half tint han choon ja a 63 year old homemaker became enraged why would you want to wear the same glasses as that evil man she said he was only putting on a show for the television cameras we still ca n't trust him but hwang chang seok the sunglasses vendor told the woman that south koreans who imitate mr kim 's choice of eye wear were helping to reduce the fear and tension between the two countries one week ago people considered kim jong il a monster and now they think his glasses are really cool mr hwang said it might sound funny but i think that 's real progress toward reunification still opposition party leaders have expressed concern that the euphoric unification fever that is gripping the nation is leading to unrealistic expectations the most undesirable effect of the inter korean summit is that the nation is now seized by a euphoria as if the threat of a war has disappeared and unification is already achieved while there exist no real changes said lee hoi chang head of the conservative grand national party mr lee said that given the euphoria south koreans might start to question the need for the 37000 american troops that have been stationed in the south since the end of the korean war in 1953 and indeed such questioning has already started in the aftermath of the summit agreement but for now it appears that most south koreans have a favorable opinion of kim jong il in a survey conducted by the chosun ilbo a conservative daily and gallup korea 88 percent of those polled said they had a good impression of the north korean leader a separate survey conducted by the korean broadcasting institute last week showed that mr kim had a 502 percent popularity rating for his political trustworthiness compared with a 151 percent rating just before the summit meeting at kyobo books the manager cho jae hyung said that after the summit meeting books on north korea and communism were in such high demand that the store had to reorder many titles and set up a special section to display them he said people of all ages had expressed interest in the books which before the summit talks were not very popular but are now among the store 's top sellers i think people are very optimistic about the changes that are occurring in korea but they are also a little scared like i am said lee kicheol a graduate student who was browsing the north korea section for many of us this is the first time that we 've honestly thought of north korea as a friend and we want to read as much as possible about this place and this man a sales clerk for samsung consumer electronics kang kyung hyung said the store was flooded with customers today inquiring about the company 's first television made in north korea customers mainly wanted to know if there was a difference in quality between models made in the north or here in the south mr kang said some people were afraid to buy it but others were very enthusiastic about purchasing something from the north some people said they were buying a piece of history while others said they were trying to show their support for north koreans who are less fortunate than us he said a sign posted above the 20 inch television which sells for a little less than 200 read in honor of the successful south north summit meeting we are pleased to announce the sales of color televisions made in north korea samsung said the north korean televisions were indistinguishable from models made in south korea except for a label on the back that indicates that the device was made in the daedongkang plant in north korea cho sung in a samsung spokeswoman said that as part of a corporate good will program to increase economic ties with north korea samsung ships the television parts to north korea where it pays a government owned factory to assemble the sets so far samsung which makes no money on the deal has received 2000 north korean televisions which were tested in the south to insure quality the company is considering investing as much as 1 billion in a fully integrated consumer

 stroller potatoes q i see children old enough to walk being pushed around in strollers can this stunt development a experts suspect that the problem is not that tired parents are using strollers while shopping but rather that they may be preventing their children from moving enough the rest of the time child development specialists think that freely crawling cruising and toddling are a normal progression in a child 's physical and cognitive development but as soon as babies can move independently they tend to be confined much of the time to strollers infant seats highchairs playpens and walkers according to dr martin i lorin a pediatrician who wrote the parents book of physical fitness for children this can mean that young muscles languish away for want of exercise in 1997 research at case western reserve university found that walkers in which children can walk without seeing their feet are likely to impair motor and mental development apparently because movement is limited and children can not freely explore their environment many experts recommend encouraging more activity for very young children not necessarily with formal exercise but by allowing normal walking running and climbing within the limits of safety and playing games as simple as catch tag and chase c claiborne ray readers are invited to submit questions by mail to question science times the new york times 229 west 43rd street new york ny 10036 3959 or by e mail to question nytimescom
 two gas explosions nearly half a mile beneath the earth killed four coal miners on sunday afternoon and left nine of their rescuers missing and presumed dead in what could be the nation 's worst mining calamity in 17 years many of those missing and unreachable in the still burning mine were colleagues of six men injured in a cave in the initial explosion at the blue creek no 5 mine the nation 's deepest about 40 miles southwest of birmingham instead of fleeing 10 miners working nearby raced to aid their comrades and were caught in a second explosion about 45 minutes later officials of the mine company jim walter resources inc said these great acts of unselfishness are eerily reminiscent of the heroes of our sept 11 national tragedy don defosset chief executive of walter industries the company 's parent said today at a news conference these men gave their lives to help others just as the firefighters and police of new york did nearly two weeks ago these men are heroes the blue creek mines which encompass a vast area between birmingham and tuscaloosa are considered ultra gassy by the federal government because of the large amounts of methane released during the mining process the mines are equipped with several air intake shafts 23 feet in diameter to bring oxygen to the miners 2100 feet below the surface and diffuse the methane but about 5 15 pm on sunday mr defosset said some rock fell from a roof section near a large battery charger and apparently caused sparks that ignited gas about 32 men were in the mine mostly maintenance workers performing repairs to machinery and 6 were in the area of the explosion three of those men got out but three others were injured when word of the explosion spread through the mine on a special paging system 10 men working elsewhere raced to the site three miles from the main elevator that took them underground once they got to the site there was a second much larger explosion possibly from methane that was trapped when the first explosion damaged ventilation shafts mr defosset said three bodies were removed from the mine and a fourth miner died of burns at a birmingham hospital today the federal mine safety agency quickly sent specialized rescue equipment to the site but agency officials said workers had been unable to use it because they encountered high levels of methane deep underground which could produce another explosion the agency also closed all operations at the mine and will investigate the accident no sign of the explosion could be seen above ground but the entrance to the mine with its conveyer belts shaft openings and mountains of stored coal is only a tip of the giant iceberg underneath schematic drawings of the mine at the company offices show tunnels laid out in the orderly pattern of a major metropolitan street grid punctuated by ventilation shafts and elevators the three walter mines in the area produce about seven million tons of bituminous coal a year for use in electric generating plants about 1300 people work in the mines part of the huge black warrior basin coal and gas field under northern alabama and mississippi and there are about 330 workers in mine no 5 said officials of the united mine workers of america local 2368 which represents the workers the company has a mixed safety record with fewer serious injuries than the industry this year but nearly double the industry average last year according to the federal mine safety and health administration a construction worker was killed in a fall at one of the local mines last month and in 1993 four men were seriously injured in a gas explosion at the no 5 mine one of those men wade gibson 43 came to the mine workers union hall today to show his support mr gibson suffered burns to more than three fourths of his body and his face though healed is now a disfigured patchwork of skin grafts and plastic surgery he never went underground again and is now retired i know exactly what they went through mr gibson said their bodies were on fire just like mine was if they 're gone at least they wo n't have to live through the pain of the burns if those missing have died the accident would be the worst in an american coal mine since dec 19 1984 when a faulty air compressor ignited a fire that killed 27 workers in the wilberg mine near orangeville utah one of the miners who survived sunday 's explosion michael mcie 42 considered himself lucky to have sustained only second degree burns i had just gotten a drink of water and walked out into the entry and the next thing i knew i felt like i was in a tornado mr mcie said from his bed at the dch regional medical center in tuscaloosa where he was listed in good condition with two broken ribs and a bruised foot and knee i rolled around to put the fire out on my clothes and then i got out brookwood where many of the miners live was already filled with half staff american flags and god bless america signs because of the terrorist attacks in new york and at the pentagon the parallels between the accident and the attack left many residents shaken it 's a tough situation knowing your parents are over there underground and ca n't get out said wayne mcbride principal of brookwood high school which several children of the trapped workers attend it 's a tragedy it 's not as big as new york but there are still lives at stake
 something about the seashore lends itself to nostalgia something to do with childhood memories or the ceaseless murmur of the waves or maybe too much sun it is probably no surprise then that our latest exercise in nostalgia has washed up on the shore of coney island baseball is back in brooklyn in a fine little park along surf avenue with a view of the beach and the boardwalk from the grandstand this is minor league baseball no less a particularly insistent suburban form of nostalgia one in which the ballplayers still hustle for pennies a day and little kids get to run around the bases after the games are over it remains to be seen whether publicly subsidized baseball can spark an economic turnaround in coney island as we have been promised yet its advent does underscore a major shift in how we as a nation now go about having fun coney island is where fun was invented at least that peculiarly american manifestation of fun known as the amusement park for most of its history fun on coney meant something fast and new something a little risque something outrageous and even dangerous the roller coaster was perfected after all on coney island and sex was always a big draw on coney the very spot where the brooklyn cyclones now roam was once steeplechase park where nearly every ride was designed to throw members of the opposite sex together albeit at bone crunching speeds women descending from mechanical horses on the steeplechase 's track found their dresses blown up by hidden jets of air while men and women alike were attacked by a leering dwarf in a harlequin costume armed with a cattle prod at one point the island featured a 150 foot tall tin and wood hotel built in the shape of an elephant with glowing yellow eyes an observatory in its houdah and rooms full of prostitutes elsewhere you could visit a village built entirely to the proportions of some 300 dwarves and midgets who lived there year round or at the infantorium you could see for a few cents the life and death struggle of premature babies in their incubators you could see aboriginal tribesmen from around the world recreations of the latest natural disasters the first motion pictures the shape of wars to come and the technological marvel that was coney itself by 1910 the three immense and wondrous parks that straddled the waterfront steeplechase luna park and dreamland were limned in millions of individual lightbulbs this spectacle required enough power to light an american city of some half million souls and the generators were tourist attractions in their own right featuring gold and enamel instruments and murals illustrating the history of electricity it was no coincidence that this coney island flourished during the height of the immigrant era new americans came to see their worst fears and their best hopes for the future not to mention new thrills and sensations of every kind the more shocking the more titillating the more novel the better perhaps it is a sign of maturity that we are no longer so forward looking or frantic in our entertainment that instead we crave the familiar the reassuring the nostalgic amusement palaces are still built on the scale of the old coney but inside they resemble nothing more than shopping malls with slot machines in every corner in much the same way the arrival of the brooklyn cyclones is meant to tame and homogenize coney island yet other attempts to sanitize coney have always failed it remains a marginal place in the city and very much a place of immigrants particularly the russian and jewish immigrants who have opened the small shops and flea markets that now dot surf avenue the city seems to want to drive out these businesses in favor of some unspecified new development yet chances are it will be the newest americans who write the future of coney island no matter how nice a memory we build in the sand kevin baker is the author of dreamland a historical novel

 give credit for bold thinking to prof euan nisbet a zimbabwean scientist now working at the university of london while the rest of us have been wringing our hands at the accelerating disappearance of glaciers professor nisbet has come up with a proposal to slow the melting of the famous glaciers atop tanzania 's mount kilimanjaro the highest mountain in africa and an iconic symbol of the continent 's beauty the crux of his plan is to drape huge tarpaulins over the edges of two glaciers to retard their melting and buy time for more lasting solutions it would be a mammoth undertaking yielding dubious benefits the glaciers on kilimanjaro have been in retreat for at least a century shrinking by 80 percent between 1912 and 2000 although it is tempting to blame global warming the most likely culprit is deforestation forests at the base of the mountain which once exhaled moisture that replenished and protected the ice fields have largely disappeared leaving the glaciers to the mercy of hot dry winds that erode and melt the high cliffs that form their edges experts say the glaciers could disappear within a decade or two taking with them a frozen record of east africa 's climate over the ages enter professor nisbet who suggests that huge white tarpaulins be draped over the edges to retard wind erosion and reflect the sunlight much as the artist christo adorns the countryside with miles of white fabric the goal is to slow the melting long enough to replant the forests an enthusiastic op ed article in this newspaper suggested that the effort to save kilimanjaro 's ice could become a powerful way to say that we do not have to accept environmental change even when it looks inevitable but at least one scientist has wondered if the plan might backfire allowing a little heat to penetrate the tarpaulins and get trapped inside thus speeding up the melting science might be better served by pouring more resources into collecting and studying ice cores before the glaciers disappear and leave africa with a new icon a bare mountaintop underscoring the folly of reckless destruction of the forests
 aposi lakwemwe considers himself one of the poorest people in one of the poorest countries all he owns is hanging on his lanky frame a torn t shirt and a too small pair of jeans plus there is his slab of cardboard which is the only thing that separates his body at night from the cold pavement nobody 's poorer than me he says with a hazy look in his eyes the result of hours of sniffing aviation fuel how can they be i do n't have anything i do n't have a mother i do n't have a home i do n't have anything but aposi 16 has plenty of competition when it comes to desperation especially among the thousands of street children who haunt the business district here as others do in many african capitals begging and robbing their way from one day to the next street children are just one visible sign of poverty african style and of how efforts to help them are sometimes defeated africa 's economies are in a long term stall in uganda well over half the population lives in poverty mostly in the countryside where they survive on less than 1 a day yet this country has made rapid economic progress the dark days of idi amin and other dictators when inflation soared and wages were worthless are in uganda 's past international lending institutions now give willingly to kampala because of the government 's fiscal discipline but aposi and many others do not see their lives improving aids has robbed many street children of their parents police officers have little sympathy for them the boys and girls too consider their only escape a whiff of glue most of us are thieves but not all of us said aposi denying that he has resorted to stealing you have to be careful around us the problem is that not enough people give to us what are we supposed to do charities do offer ways out but they are tough to adjust to after years of scrounging in garbage cans and outrunning security guards and brawling with other street children sometimes the solutions even have problems of their own one of the numerous organizations providing for street children is the africa foundation a group founded by kefa sempangi who is a member of uganda 's parliament a christian leader and a longtime advocate of street youth mr sempangi has set up numerous group homes to turn street children back into just plain children at first he allows the children to continue their glue sniffing and other drug taking then he weans them away from destructive habits as they begin shedding their pasts they attend classes and turn their backs on the street that is the theory anyway for every success story mr sempangi can claim he acknowledges that there are other cases of heartbreak and the street children are not the only ones who fail mr sempangi lost the bulk of his financing recently after a dutch foundation called redt een kind or help a child accused him of misappropriating the 8000 a month the group was sending to support 241 street children mr sempangi has been forced to close one of his homes in mukono which had cared for 500 children from a variety of backgrounds ten of the youths have moved in with the local anglican archbishop mpalanyi nkoyoyo those with families have been sent home but some of the children mr sempangi had been caring for have found themselves sleeping on cardboard again now along with his political work and his charitable work mr sempangi is trying to save his reputation he appeared recently alongside a large group of street youths who marched through the city carrying banners supporting him and asking other donors to help the crowd included a glue sniffing teenage mother who held her infant daughter like a rag doll mr sempangi dismisses any talk of shady dealing he says accounting for all the spending is sometimes as messy as the work itself do donors want to know he asks that new mattresses had to be discarded because boys had wet them repeatedly or that blankets were there one day and gone the next sometimes sold by the very children he was trying to help mr sempangi lashes out at other charities that feed the youth right on the street that acts as an incentive he says for the children to stay put the children their expressions part puppy dog and part pit bull are but some of the faces of africa 's poor most of the continent 's destitute live away from big cities in the remoteness of the bush aid groups reach them too but it is often mother nature who decides whether they eat or go without poverty is everywhere said osborn muyanja who is one of mr sempangi 's success stories the young man emerged from one of africa foundation 's group homes years ago and now counsels others struggling against poverty you wake up in the morning and you help everyone you can help he said of his daily routine the problem does not go away though someone needs food someone needs clothing there 's so much need in this country and there 's only so much time time is all that aposi has his mother died when he was young and he lost touch with his father he remembers hopping on a bus from northern uganda when he was about 14 and arriving in kampala alone he says he wants a better life with an education and a job and a real bed but until he figures a real way out he relies on a drug induced one when i sniff i forget about everything he said i have another life i 'm not so poor anymore as aposi spoke some of his contemporaries were busily begging on the nearby sidewalk they put on sad faces and extended their palms at a stream of well dressed men and women who happened to be visiting government officials from around africa who were at a conference on international trade the boys wanted quicker assistance than the conference could provide they wanted coins
 mayor rudolph w giuliani said yesterday that his administration 's new plan to close the fresh kills landfill and ship the city 's trash from existing waterfront stations would reduce truck traffic and not unfairly burden any city neighborhood city council leaders also praised the plan and promised to work to approve it quickly speaker peter f vallone and other council members had criticized mr giuliani 's original plan which would have created a garbage station in red hook to handle 12000 tons of garbage a day the new plan would abandon such large scale waste plants in exchange for trucking the garbage to the city 's eight existing marine transfer stations from which the garbage would then be shipped out of state those stations were originally built to help ship garbage to the fresh kills landfill which by state law must close in 2002 it 's a very sensible plan mr giuliani said it 's an environmentally sound plan it does n't add any burdens any place and it allows us to solve this even earlier than we thought the city 's sanitation department will formally present details of the plan to the city council on wednesday if the council approves the plan it would be sent to the state for review the benefits and burdens of this plan are divided equally mr vallone said i think most people will accept it the mayor has come so far in our direction that we should n't have any major stumbling blocks council leaders and administration officials estimate that disposing of residential garbage under the proposed plan will cost 95 a ton the city now pays 50 to 70 per ton for trash disposal but city officials said costs were rising rapidly and that carting garbage out of the city by truck would not save money in the long run the bottom line is the cost compares favorably said martha hirst a deputy commissioner at the sanitation department this is a terribly efficient system to use just tip and go under this plan all the residential waste will leave new york city by barge or rail the plan calls for new transfer stations at the fresh kills landfill and on the queens bank of newtown creek the newtown creek station would handle the 1000 tons per day of queens garbage that is now shipped to greenpoint brooklyn the city would also renovate an existing transfer station in the south bronx and expand one near the southwest brooklyn incinerator in gravesend under the plan the city would demolish the shuttered incinerator the success of the plan hinges on an agreement with linden nj to handle 10000 tons of new york city 's garbage every day the linden city council has approved the plan though it must still win the approval of the state department of environmental protection charles j crane a member of the linden city council and the union county utilities authority praised the transfer station plan which he said would provide his city with a 13 million annual payment and help revitalize the city 's industrial base he said he thought governor christine todd whitman would give the plan her blessing the transfer station is located on the arthur kill away from residential areas mr crane said i do n't see it why it should be controversial this is the kind of thing governor whitman has been looking for to take care of our declining cities efforts to reach a spokesman for governor whitman last night by phone were unsuccessful stanley e michels the chairman of the new york city council 's environmental protection committee said the agreement with linden required study but he added that it was important to quickly end the carting of residential garbage by truck we need to implement this plan as soon as possible to reduce the time we have to be under the interim plan mr michels said
 making schools work a revolutionary plan to get your children the education they need by william g ouchi simon schuster this ambitious book wants to do no less than show parents and educators how to revolutionize their schools dr ouchi a professor of management at the university of california at los angeles and an expert in organizational structure set out to study what characteristics made one school district successful and another failing he chose six school systems three centralized top down new york city los angeles and chicago and three successful seattle houston and edmonton canada from this experience dr ouchi developed seven keys to success which he skillfully illustrates through descriptions of some of the 223 public and independent schools he and his research team visited while details vary the overall pattern is simple bad schools fail largely because of too much district oversight and micromanaging great schools have entrepreneurial principals who are in complete control including of their own budgets dr ouchi found his holy grail in edmonton which decentralized three decades ago the other districts he deemed successful including well regarded district 2 in manhattan were emulating edmonton and shifting more authority to individual schools in particular dr ouchi author of the best selling theory z how american business can meet the japanese challenge shows how schools could have the funds they need to improve if they controlled their own budgets this is an important argument given the debate over financing schools in disadvantaged communities there 's one problem dr ouchi occasionally ignores evidence that hurts his argument take houston the texas miracle has been crumbling lately nowhere more so than in houston which turns out to have drastically understated dropout rates this ca n't be a surprise to dr ouchi since he did n't believe what houston told him in the first place his own calculations showed that just 45 percent of its first graders graduate from high school a figure close to those found in a recent state audit and he admits that reading and math scores are below the national average even so he writes that improvements in student achievement are dramatic to the point of straining the limits of credibility but they 're true the numbers hardly justify such praise so why does dr ouchi consider houston a success story because it 's decentralizing he is so convinced good things will follow that he allows himself to believe they already have that said he does visit individual houston schools that seem to be succeeding the book 's greatest value is not its reform plan anyway it is insights into understanding what is really going on in schools teachers and administrators weigh in on what to look for elementary classrooms should be stuffed with books teachers should be working with a few students not lecturing at the entire class principals should give you a tour of classrooms a principal who prefers just to walk down the hall is one of the most telling signs that things are n't right making schools work may not lead to a revolution as dr ouchi hopes but it explains what is good and bad about schools with sound ideas on how to improve them timothy a hacsi

 for the nation 's most feared islamic militant no glory was waiting at the end of the road he was killed in a late night shootout in this dusty farm village in the blistering plains of south punjab in his 36 years the militant riaz basra the head of the dreaded sunni extremist group lashkar i jangvi had led a life brimming with murderous action along with a legend of miraculous escapes his activities ranged from a bombing attack against former prime minister nawaz sharif three years ago and the murder of an iranian diplomat in 1990 to multiple jailbreaks and exile he eventually gained the leadership of a terrorist training camp in afghanistan in alliance with the taliban and fought with the anti soviet mujahedeen in between there were the killings of hundreds of doctors policemen and lawyers from his country 's shiite muslim minority and a notorious lahore cemetery massacre of 1998 in which 25 shiite mourners were gunned down and 50 injured as they recited the koran he sprinkled his resume with numerous bank robberies like the bandit queen of india mr basra 's career even included a run for political office in 1989 when he sought election to the regional assembly of lahore but lost a simple villager armed with a 22 caliber rifle and a few neighbors with old pump action rifles and handguns brought down mr basra the villager fida hussain ghalvi was on guard on top of his house on tuesday as he said he was every night since mr basra 's group killed his brother in 1997 he stood guard because he feared that mr basra 's rogues would come back to stop him from testifying in murder cases involving his brother and others on this night the terrorist leader and three comrades approached his home at 3 30 am with ak 47 rifles and rockets launchers mr ghalvi 44 said mr ghalvi a soft spoken father of three said he had no idea the attackers included mr basra although he knew immediately that it was the lashkar group it had come for him several times in the past killing over 20 villagers here they pulled up to the house in a suzuki and when a guy got out and i asked him who he was they opened fire with kalashnikovs mr ghalvi said i returned the fire from my rooftop and soon many of the neighbors were firing too two of the terrorists fell in the street and two others broke into my compound by the grace of god they died in the exact spot they had slaughtered people here several years ago as he spoke he was surrounded by visitors who had come to his house to congratulate him they met in a living room decorated with islamic art and photographs mr ghalvi 's story generally corresponds to the official version of events a half hour after the shooting began a heavily armed special police brigade arrived and finished off the surviving assailants the authorities say the body was positively identified the next day and relatives turned out for a funeral today that drew 3000 mourners to his native village in sargodha the news of mr basra 's death was slow to sink in here because the police have claimed to have killed him many times before only to reveal later that they had shot the wrong man in a typical expression of doubt one newspaper carried a totally straight report of the fatal shootout under the headline basra killed again we have heard many times before that he is dead but our hearts do n't believe it yet said asim nadeen a shopkeeper who sells spices biscuits and tea in a small town nearby people say he was a real goon but only god can judge him the death of mr basra is a reminder that in this part of the world terrorism is not limited to osama bin laden pakistan and its neighbors crawl with groups like mr basra 's lashkar i jangvi but they have usually reserved their wrath for fellow muslims and have not become well known in the west but since the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon the united states has urged pakistan to rein in militant islamic groups it has done so with mixed results as terror has continued against americans including the reporter daniel pearl the 11 french citizens killed by a car bomb in karachi and the continuing violence in kashmir an attack on an indian army camp there this week killed 34 but many pakistanis say it is pakistan 's own intelligence services that have been the most important sponsors of fanaticism this all began when president zia was facing a challenge from civilian political groups said rashid ahmad khan a former dean of political science at punjab university referring to the former president mohammad zia ul haq in order to reduce their influence he decided to split the country along ethnic and sectarian lines and began sponsoring these groups many of them were sent to training camps in afghanistan and when they came back it was to sow terror and sabotage in pakistan sardar nur ahmad khan a lawyer and former president of the regional bar said poor men like riaz basra are recruited from the religious schools and turned into terrorists and the result is panic for all of us for mr ghalvi the killing of mr basra has only increased his turmoil i ca n't even go outside he said they will come again because i have killed their

 the american composers alliance has hit retirement age ah let 's rephrase that the organization founded by aaron copland and roger sessions in 1937 to further the role of the composer in america celebrated its 65th birthday last weekend with six concerts of music by past and present members the anniversary concert itself on saturday night commemorated sessions with music by him and his students and grandstudents milton babbitt studied with sessions george edwards studied with mr babbitt and so on over time organizations can get clubby and this band of uptown composers seemed all the more so through presenting their concerts in the elegant kosciuszko foundation on east 65th street in manhattan against a backdrop of gilt framed works by polish masters velvet drapes and an air  conditioner with a quiet insistent rattle the unwritten charter of this particular club involves a brand of intellectually sanctioned music steeped in serialist tradition and complex atonal theory the program note for the chamber concerto by hubert howe the group 's president gives an idea the piece is based on a series of pentachordal arrays that exclude the collection 02350 a group of trichordal arrays that are embedded in these arrays and another group of tetrachordal arrays that use the same interconnecting arrays these statements fail to convey much about what mr howe 's piece in its world premiere sounded like sounds piled together in ways more interesting to the ear in their juxtapositions than in say their phrasing if you did n't have the proof of the incredible underlying complexity of the work you might almost think it was a little simplistic by the same token sessions 's reputation as the founding father of this particular club does n't convey the sheer sturdy craftsmanship of his duo for violin and piano the piece tugs at the moorings of tonality but is dominated less by tonality than by simple solid tone showcased both through the composer 's excellent sense of pacing and a rousing performance by philip wharton a violinist nor does mr babbitt 's status as a thorny serialist reflect the quirky humor that pervades pieces like around the horn 1993 essentially a stand up routine for a virtuoso soloist excellently communicated by karl kramer the evening 's highlights were pieces that did n't strictly toe the party line mr sessions 's students included enfants terribles like david del tredici whose virtuoso alice here adequately performed by the composer should be programmed by star pianists it is large scale heart on the sleeve music that keeps winking at the listener archly cocking its head as if to say call me a guilty pleasure i dare you and then doing something startling and wonderful and fun andrew violette ended the evening with another blow in the face of staid tradition by placing seven musicians around the room for six performances and setting each of them off on a different difficult musical line the experience was akin to sitting in the middle of a tuning orchestra partly marvelous and partly headache inducing but new and bold we 'll certainly grant him

 they are to be truthful as few and random as summer 's last fireflies but every now and then sparks of theatrical magic light up the dim landscape of the late henry moss sam shepard 's new play at the signature theater company and for those fleeting moments the dark anxious and uncertain world outside does n't exist at all at such moments you remember gratefully that playwrights of fierce imagination can indeed work this transporting sorcery even when their own attitudes to life are definitely dark and anxious and so there you are grinning away at the audacity of the image of a voluptuous woman in a bathtub holding a dead fish as a lure to catch weak men or at the pointed language of forgetfulness that is always spoken by reunited family members in shepard land the grin unfortunately does n't linger in the late henry moss which opened last night under the direction of joseph chaikin with a cast led by ethan hawke a popular hit in san francisco last year in a staging by mr shepard packed with two fisted marquee names sean penn nick nolte woody harrelson the play itself is long plodding and diminishingly crowded with echoes from stronger shepard works the title character here is dear old destructive dad a seedy hard drinking figure who has shown up in many of mr shepard 's plays both in the unwashed flesh buried child fool for love and as the son warping center of memorably spun anecdotes true west henry moss is mr shepard 's most earnest and direct attempt to pin down this festering paternal ghost and to find the attendant filial guilt and responsibility the results suggest that mr shepard of all people may be ripe for a guest spot on oprah the play is part of the 10th anniversary celebration of signature the essential manhattan theater company that devotes itself to exploring the lesser known works of eminent american dramatists for shepard scholars and hard core fans count me among them henry moss has its value it explains itself in ways that mr shepard 's plays seldom do moving inexorably to that big moment of self confrontation regularly found in dysfunction of the week television movies yet the overall effect is n't half as illuminating as that of mr shepard 's more seemingly obscure works his singular gift has been for building mysteries out of the ordinary ingredients of american family life in which home becomes less a place to rediscover than to lose your identity this remains a theme in henry moss and the evening begins tantalizingly as the brothers ray mr hawke and earl arliss howard swap clashing memories with a whiskey bottle between them and their father 's corpse on a metal frame bed just behind them it 's a classic shepard setup posing the question of who really owns the past normally his answer is that no one does that history and memory keep shifting on us here there seems to be one incontrovertible reality that ray has spent his life fleeing and we have cottoned on to what that is so early that the staggered series of stories and flashbacks in which we get to meet old henry guy boyd feels like a slow dance of 700 veils this is a play that keeps pressing for answers by having characters ask questions like would you mind going through the whole story for me one more time that line is spoken by ray and it more or less sums up his character the younger of the brothers ray is a hostile interrogator of anyone who knows anything about the last days of his father 's life in a bare bones shack in the the desert of new mexico the quintessentially shepardesque set is by christine jones that includes earl who says he found the body the solicitous next door neighbor esteban jose perez and the logorrheic taxi driver clark middleton who took henry on a fatal fishing trip his companion on that expedition was a stormy sensualist named conchalla lupina sheila tousey and boy are we glad she 's around ms tousey has a bizarrely anachronistic role that of woman as both life giver and life taker but the part benefits from being written from mr shepard 's willful befuddlement with women and he has fun with his own incomprehension and ms tousey has a field day plowing robustly through this idea of a rocky earth goddess none of the men have located similarly secure handles on their characters and mr chaikin has n't given them a classic shepard style wrestling match production in which they could lose themselves in adrenaline mr hawke who showed he can play dumb with wit and intelligence in a recent revival of camino real has a couple of funny bits in which ray trips on his own ingenuousness but it 's a tiresome part in which a man becomes a combination of gestapo interrogator and psychiatrist to his own brother mr howard whose earl at least gets the chance to fall apart fares better and the evening 's few genuinely disturbing moments belong to him but for henry moss to work at all you have to believe in the dominating menace of its title character and mr boyd plays him as a jackie gleason style drunk he is merely pathetic which may be mr shepard 's point but the production should n't give it away so early over the past decade mr shepard has forsaken the experimental forms with which he made his name in favor of more conventional rigidly structured narratives but in so doing he has tamed and fenced in an imagination that was born to run wild henry moss has just enough glimmers of perversity to suggest that this freer spirit the sort of authentically original american voice that is so much to be cherished right now is still somewhere inside mr shepard it 's time to let it loose again the late henry moss by sam shepard directed by joseph chaikin sets by christine jones costumes by teresa snider stein lighting by michael chybowski original

 racing the antelope what animals can teach us about running and life by bernd heinrich illustrated 292 pp new york cliff street books harpercollins publishers 23 bernd heinrich provides welcome relief from technological shut ins who run outdoors while wearing headphones such sensory invalids their aural blinders seem a violation of the essence of running which is a rustling of the unconfined no muffling hindrances for heinrich a zoologist whose previous nature writing earned a nomination for the national book award when he runs he seems to see and hear everything in sensurround the haunting cries of geese and the soaring wing beats of butterflies noted with the precision of a marathoner recording split times since he was 4 heinrich has been on the run from the russian advance into poland along sandy barefoot trails of postwar germany on a steamship across the atlantic through fields and around cinder tracks in high school and college and finally on a circling of concrete loops in chicago attempting to break the american record for the 100 kilometer 62 mile run it was this ultramarathon on oct 4 1981 that inspired his new book racing the antelope for him running has provided escape acceptance a measure of objective achievement beyond even the impartiality of science the quality of running can not be defined in terms of anyone 's use or place in a hierarchy or plan he writes the test is the race where credentials mean nothing and performances everything the book operates on several levels as a memoir natural history experimental training guide it has its weaknesses heinrich 's insights about running sometimes limp toward metaphor for life sentimentality and his knowledge of elite international competition seems as dated as the prototype sneakers that nike once fashioned with a waffle iron but there is an unfailing wonder in his writing that gives the book a transforming visual quality the overall effect is as if the boston marathon were being televised by the discovery channel by 41 heinrich had run the equivalent of four times around the earth but did he have the endurance to cover 62 miles a distance more than twice the length of a standard 262 mile marathon an enervating exercise that would require more than six and a half hours of continuous running he knew of no ultramarathon training manuals so he looked to nature could the evolutionary adaptations of other animals assist his own endurance nectar collecting bees because they do n't sweat regurgitate and spread over their bodies their stomach contents for evaporative cooling vultures can drop their body temperature as much as 36 degrees fahrenheit by excreting waste on their legs pronghorn antelopes always keep their mouths open when they run saving energy by curtailing the resistance of expelled air although unlike deer they have n't evolved the ability to make vertical jumps over fences dogs synchronize breathing with their strides reducing the amount of output required for inhalation and exhalation camels store in their fatty humps a source of concentrated food akin to power bars the champion runner is the american cockroach which can sprint on its hind two legs at a pace of 50 body lengths per second while heinrich offers page after page of fascinating biological adaptation he is less successful attempting to explain one of the more urgent questions of human endurance how athletes from the east african nation of kenya have come to dominate distance running he even lived for a time in neighboring tanzania and as a runner and a scientist he might have been expected to add a fresh voice to the discussion instead we get a cursory deliberation heinrich sides with the cultural argument as many do but by completely discounting altitude as a factor as he appears to he risks his credibility on the subject sea level performance is not increased by training at altitudes he writes a flat assertion that would be countered by many scientists and marathoners a majority of the world 's elite distance runners train at altitude for a period while preparing for sea level races in order to build up their oxygen carrying capacity in the thin air he also writes naively about performance enhancing drugs to say about distance running that on the whole it is honest is callow to be charitable in fact there is no way to know many believe the exact opposite is true suspicion of drug use is so rampant that the new york city marathon and other leading ones have called for blood testing at their events heinrich is engaging when he details his own training methods born of science quirky intuition and a willingness to subvert convention for instance he never stretched before a run because muscles deliver power only when pulled taut i 'd never heard of a yogi who was a great runner even socks would be too heavy to wear in an ultramarathon in running 62 miles he would take 124000 steps lifting an extra ounce of foot weight one inch higher than necessary on each stride would amount to lifting a 900 pound weight one foot off the ground he would have to glide close to the ground like an ostrich lifting his body only three inches with each step would result in a cumulative vertical distance of two miles punishing work an ultramarathoner can not double his body weight in fat for fuel like a migrating bird so heinrich had to find an efficient balance between short term carbohydrate energy for speed and fat metabolism for endurance one way to keep blood sugar levels up during a race is to absorb carbohydrates from the digestive tract heinrich experimented by gulping honey and olive oil and trained by eating a sandwich hamburger and fries and even a full meal immediately before a long run once he started a long race carrying three six packs of beer for carbo replenishing finally he settled on cranberry juice which like nectar is a diluted sugar solution the day of his big race having arrived heinrich set off to take the measure of his imagination an endurance predator on a symbolic communal hunt the human experience is populated with dreams and aspirations he writes for me the animal totem for these dreams is the antelope swift strong and elusive most of us chase after 'antelopes and sometimes we catch them often we do n't but why do we bother to try i think it is because without dream antelopes to chase we become what a lap dog is to a wolf and we are inherently more like wolves than lap dogs jere longman the author of the girls of summer covers running as a sportswriter for the times

 richard york gallery 21 east 65th street manhattan through may 10 born in london in 1812 john william hill came to america as a boy and spent most of his life in west nyack ny while working as a draftsman for the new york state geological survey he discovered john ruskin whose writings deeply influenced the english pre raphaelites hill cared nothing for the pre raphaelites medievalist mythology but he took to heart ruskin 's admonition to work directly from nature and he became the founder of the now barely remembered american pre raphaelite movement this exhibition of works on paper from 1848 to 1876 includes many small landscape pencil drawings and watercolors skillfully made with meticulous delicacy longer views of mountains valleys and lakes tend to be conventionally picturesque for all its sunny luminosity there is a small brush fussiness in the large watercolor of a mill with two boys at the pond 's edge it makes one wish for the vigor of homer 's watercolors it is when he drew close to study things in detail that hill 's work comes alive two remarkable still life watercolors stand out from everything else in the show fruits vegetables and nuts are arranged on the ground with grass and weeds behind them the composition is flat footed as though the artist was less interested in making a nice picture than in testing the limits of his observational capabilities rendered with zillions of minuscule multicolored brushstrokes the objects under study assume a robust earthy palpability that one imagines henry david thoreau would have appreciated ken johnson
 with mideast peace talks stalled ariel sharon israel 's prime minister says his government could decide within months to unilaterally set a makeshift border with the palestinians but where would israel draw the boundary mr sharon is not saying but it would most likely follow the zigs and zags of the barrier israel is building which under the current route carves off about 15 percent of the west bank land that palestinians want for a future state but mr sharon has not yet announced whether the barrier would run through the jordan valley near the border with jordan if it headed in that direction palestinians claim the barrier would be likely to take around half the land in the west bank greg myre

 gay rights organizations in alabama and washington called yesterday for the resignation of chief justice roy moore of the alabama supreme court who wrote in a child custody opinion issued on friday that homosexuality was considered abhorrent immoral detestable a crime against nature and a violation of the laws of nature and of nature 's god chief justice moore who was championed by the religious right as a lower court judge after he hung a copy of the ten commandments on his courtroom wall argued in a concurring opinion that homosexuality was an inherent evil against which children must be protected he said homosexuals were presumptively unfit to have custody of minor children under the established laws of this state the case concerned a custody battle between a father of three children and his former wife a lesbian two groups in alabama that promote equal rights for gays the gay and lesbian alliance of alabama and equality begins at home of central alabama asked chief justice moore to leave the bench he has shown there is no way he can fairly judge any cases involving gay and lesbian citizens of alabama or their family and friends ken e baker chairman of equality begins at home said in montgomery the executive director of the national gay and lesbian task force lorri l jean said it is appalling to see that blatant bigotry and unrepentant ignorance reign supreme in alabama 's highest court chief justice moore has decreed that his personal religious beliefs will now be the law of the land in alabama this violates the constitutional mandate of separation of church and state and it renders him unfit to serve as a judge state representative alvin holmes democrat of montgomery said he would ask the alabama judicial inquiry commission to examine chief justice moore 's opinion to see whether he should be removed mr holmes maintained that chief justice moore had violated judicial canons that require a judge to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the judicial office into disrepute and to not allow his family social or other relationships to influence his judicial conduct or judgment a spokesman for chief justice moore who was elected in 2000 did not return a call for comment chief justice moore wrote his opinion in concurrence with a 9 to 0 ruling by the supreme court that awarded primary physical custody of the children to their father over their lesbian mother the decision written by another justice was based more on procedural issues than on the court 's view of the mother 's homosexuality and its relationship to her abilities as a parent indeed the consensus opinion barely mentioned the mother 's sexual orientation that made it all the more striking that chief justice moore wrote a long and heavily footnoted essay about homosexuality and his view of its effects on children mr baker said he considered the chief justice 's words as an invitation to violence he noted that tuesday was the third anniversary of the beating death of billy jack gaither a gay alabamian who was bludgeoned and burned by two men who confessed that they had been incited by mr gaither 's homosexuality he knows the power of words like 'inherently evil mr baker said of chief justice moore all he did n't do was hand out the rope

 to the editor adults as well as children need to know that being a vegetarian means more than just not eating meat july 25 you must replace protein and calcium sources many think they will be healthier if they just take meat out of their diets that is dangerous for many to maintain nutrition and muscle mass you must feed your body other sources like tofu and legumes i recommend that parents who want to raise their children as vegetarians follow diets devised by physicians or dietitians carnivorous children do n't like what adults eat so why should vegetarian children be expected to follow an adult oriented vegetarian diet vegetarian children require much more attention to their diets than their meat eating peers and this takes very much planning and effort i have been a vegan for 10 years and it is not easy particularly in a culture that loves fast food and considers meat a staple celeste stec pittsburgh
 ours is an era in which there is not much fishing that is as good as it used to be and even less that is better than it ever was the rio grande on the island of tierra del fuego off the southern tip of south america is a happy anomaly over the last 30 years the river has produced sea run brown trout in steadily increasing sizes according to mel krieger the west coast writer and fly fishing evangelist who recently introduced me to this stream the rio grande right now is the greatest anadromous fishery on earth big statement but then so are the trout in six days of fishing at the sprawling estancia maria behety in bone chilling water and tooth rattling wind i landed a half dozen trout over 15 pounds and one 27 1 2 pounder on a no 12 prince nymph the piscatorial equivalent i suppose of shooting a grizzly with a slingshot my accomplishments were just about average for our group of 14 anglers why are the trout so big there are probably a combination of factors a strict catch and release policy over the length of the river no commercial fishing or netting where the rio grande begins in the atlantic the tendency of species to achieve their largest sizes at the extremities of their range and krieger says a warming of the antarctic waters that has enriched the whole food chain i arrived late last month braced for the legendary winds that whip across the patagonian steppe providentially the winds were usually no worse than a gusty october afternoon at montauk an 8 weight rod more than did the job at twilight on march 28 i spent an hour that i now remember more fully than i can recall some years a morning session had yielded a couple of 10 pounders and a few airborne leaps for freedom by considerably larger fish that spit straightened or broke my hooks that afternoon we went to a stretch of river where a short cast into a deep pool was supposed to summon leviathan but the water was cold and the fish sluggish my partner mickey schwartz of el paso and our guide alberto molina gomez were stymied maybe it was the fearsome aspect of schwartz 's hat that put the trout down it was a towering alaskan fur headpiece reminiscent of cossack battle gear gomez 's more likely explanation was that the lack of a current left our flies looking lifeless and unappetizing at 7 o'clock my inner fisherman told me forget it pal but gomez perhaps the most experienced and knowledgeable guide on the river was determined vamos al otro poso he said let 's go to another pool i hesitated alberto it 's 7 o'clock we quit at 8 fifteen minutes to get there does n't leave us much time to fish but you 're the guide the sun descended the sky turned a brazen crimson behind the mountains of chile melting snows from a late season storm brought the water temperature down to 38 degrees we pulled up to a bend in the river aca gomez announced right about here as it is with salmon rio grande trout returning to spawn often stop at predictable spots sometimes no bigger than a living room take the downstream bend schwartz offered in his courtly west texas drawl i tied on a no 12 prince nymph best described as a combination zug bug and classic catskills wet fly a fish rolled reminiscent of the porpoising motion of a rolling tarpon it is a seductive display but rarely does it result in a take i ignored it and quarter cast downstream throwing in an upstream mend to give the 200 grain sink tip time to carry the fly to the bottom where the trout would surely be if they were anywhere the rod pointed straight at the moon full and orange as it rose over the bank a flock of banduria ibises whose call is a cheering combination of a stutter and a giggle flew over me for two weeks their evening flights heralded a few moments of good fishing the fly stopped and the line became taut i pulled back bottom i told myself thinking that i had hung up on a champa a caved in grassy bank but then the bottom moved it gave two jolting thumps i reeled up the fish took line first my shooting head then my running line then my backing i followed along the river bank trying to stay even with the fish in counterpoint to my frenzy the trout shook its head with a percussive snap my rod tip bowed then it recovered slowly over and over every now and then the fish burst for the cover of the far bank i countered by moving my rod tip my wrist ached my fingers began to seize up in the gathering darkness and deepening cold tranquilo gomez counseled which roughly translates to easy boy i backed away from the stream slowly and with a light tread like someone easing out of a room so as not to wake a sleeping baby luck was with me the trout came to the surface gomez dipped his net and captured the fish in the moonlight i could see it was bright silver a recent returnee from the ocean full of vigor and fight he took out his scale twelve and a half kilos i did the math 27 1 2 pounds its length nearly 30 inches on any other stream if i caught a fish that was 30 inches long it would make my year gomez revived it in the current for a minute he let go of its tail the huge trout disappeared into the deep dark water slowly like a silver ghost melting back into the night as the memory of it took up permanent residence in my soul

 to the editor i would love to walk run skate or cycle to work letter june 26 in fact when we first moved to long island my husband and i frequently tried to after far too many close calls with cars driven by people who had no driving skills on roads that had no pedestrian or bicycle lanes we gave up shortly after a bicyclist who did not follow our lead was hit and killed that was more than a decade ago the roads continue to be entirely lacking in suitable access for nonvehicular travel and our country continues to use the lion 's share of the world 's oil and gas chaining us to a foreign policy that only inflames terrorism it appears that we those who lead us and those who follow will continue to take the path of least resistance which in the end will cost us the most donna kat setauket ny june 26 2002

 a prominent figure in celebrity folklore is the blonde bottle or real who accedes to stardom by scheming or seducing or marrying or some combination of the three think marilyn monroe madonna princess diana even senator hillary rodham clinton now think tina brown according to a trashy new biography brown the former editor of the new yorker and the current one of talk was born into obscurity the british kind which means she lacked a peerage and required ruthless drive sexual wiles and marriage to harry evans to overcome that condition naturally her story ends badly these stories are gratifying only when they do for those who have somehow avoided the gossip dribbling out of harry and tina come to america by judy bachrach here 's her version of brown 's life the daughter of a b grade british film producer and his socially ambitious wife brown goes to oxford but only to one of its lesser women 's colleges she overcomes that handicap with the single mindedness of a character played by reese witherspoon among the many men she takes up with are martin amis and auberon waugh who usher her into the world of literary celebrity next she writes a play that is produced and favorably reviewed back at oxford though brown is not taken seriously her maternal grandfather having been jewish snootier oxonians refuse to be impressed she 's a tough ambitious girl clearly very ambitious she 's jewish and quite like her mother one of them tells bachrach years later she is to journalism what barbra streisand is to movies says another however as a freelancer with a satiric eye she attracts the attention of evans the popular equally nonaristocratic editor of what many believed to be the best british newspaper of the day the sunday times he leaves his wife and three children for her she takes a job editing tatler a failing society magazine and turns it around by simultaneously sucking up to and making fun of the socialites who read it evans loses his job after rupert murdoch buys the times brown gets an even better one having been asked to rescue a foundering vanity fair by si newhouse who has bought tatler the rest their move to america her editorship of the new yorker his of random house has been material for gossip columns ever since so what after all this time are we to make of harry evans and tina brown bachrach is little help in this department if you want to understand evans whose genuine charm and love of journalism wilt on bachrach 's pages read philip norman 's everyone 's gone to the moon a wry roman a clef of evans 's and brown 's early careers as for brown bachrach is too busy for larger opinions she 's got to snipe at brown for everything from not being pretty or fashionable enough to minor infractions of the often overwrought american conflict of interest rules but the book does offer despite itself some insights into the woman who obsessed new york media society until roughly last year when talk began to seem like just another closable start up for one thing contrary to brown 's reputation as a humorless ice goddess she 's capable of a sly wickedness once after she invited the comedian roseanne barr to be guest editor of a special issue of the new yorker devoted to women george w s trow resigned from the magazine with a note comparing her to someone selling her soul to get close to the hapsburgs 1913 brown wrote back i am distraught at your defection but since you never actually write anything i should say i am notionally distraught another insight provided by bachrach has less to do with the content of her book than with the ironic implications of her style which she honed as a writer for yes vanity fair though after brown left to skewer brown and evans with nasty personal gossip is to practice what brown perfected the journalism of dish what 's striking is how tedious it is at vanity fair brown 's editorial philosophy was informed by two insights first that celebrities are intrinsically worth knowing about no matter what they 're like and second that american celebrities take themselves very seriously that means they must be praised with great earnestness or smeared with all available dirt with the intensity due to people of their station to read bachrach is to flash back to the unintended literary consequences of this approach on the new yorker despite brown 's admirable efforts to jolt the magazine out of its twee complacency her brave defiance of its clubbiness her hiring of talented young editors and writers she imposed a tone as crippling as the one she set out to replace brown was wicked but not wicked enough the problem with her many chronicles about hollywood stars and media moguls was n't vulgarity it was all that face time with people whose personalities resisted writers best efforts to bring them to life brown 's new yorker had its moments especially at the beginning when she 'd kept the best of the old and had n't succumbed to the worst of the new it was exhilarating to watch the rapid emergence of new names format changes and subjects previously deemed too down market to deal with there were triumphs lawrence wright exposing recovered memory syndrome as a fraud richard preston on the ebola virus the talk of the town department was briefly delightful though its bumbling british editor alexander chancellor was the laughingstock of new york at the time his section finessed brown 's demand that every subject be hot with a skepticism so dry and genial it apparently went unnoticed eventually brown developed the confidence to act on her own passions as every editor must but confined as she had been to the climate controlled environment of new york limousine culture many of them turned out to be airless brown 's deepest emotional connection appeared to be to other female celebrities there was the special new yorker issue devoted to princess diana there was that scoop in the first issue of talk in which hillary rodham clinton revealed bill 's childhood abuse bachrach says brown so strongly identified with the beleaguered first lady that she took over the editing of the piece writing in a comparison between hillary and diana that mortified the article 's author after some wrangling it was dropped it 's as if brown had grown attached to the tabloid inflected tragic vision of herself long before bachrach happened along to write it down if talk fails as many suspect it will will brown 's future be as bleak as bachrach seems to want it to be the media world is darwinian and rarely grants a second chance to editors nearing 50 but even bachrach hints at a more appealing possible twist it seems brown has been keeping a diary since she was 12 the thought is awe inspiring it 's no stretch to imagine her as the chronicler of her era the samuel pepys of late 20th century trans atlantic society she 's got the access maybe she 'll finally let loose the wit

 the be nice to monty buttons were on display today and for the most part the bulging united states open galleries obliged if only the unforgiving black course at bethpage state park had been so kind plagued by a chronically sore back and an inaccurate putting stroke colin montgomerie struggled to a five over par 75 leaving him eight strokes behind the leader tiger woods after the first round of the 102nd united states open montgomerie who turns 39 a week from sunday and who is still searching for his first major championship may have knocked himself out of contention early this time he bogeyed three of the first six holes he played as he opened his round on the course 's more difficult back nine after running off seven consecutive pars montgomerie made his only birdie at the par 4 fifth hole but followed it by bogeying three of the final four holes he played i wish monty was nicer to himself montgomerie said in brief remarks to reporters afterward at least montgomerie felt welcome the scottish born montgomerie has been the subject of widespread heckling at tournaments in the united states in the past to the point that he threatened this year never to come back but today he received nice ovations and vocal encouragement at nearly every hole there was a lot of love out there said mike o'malley the executive editor of golf digest whose magazine came up with the be nice to monty buttons as a way of defusing any potential animosity between montgomerie and the large crowds montgomerie 's often contentious relationship with fans in the united states dates from the 1997 open at congressional country club just outside washington where he was bothered by a commotion in the crowd while waiting to putt on the 71st hole montgomerie wound up second by a stroke to ernie els at the urging of a local radio host montgomerie was heckled at the 1998 open at the olympic club in san francisco the feud reached its peak during the 1999 ryder cup at the country club in brookline mass just outside boston where the united states made the greatest comeback in ryder cup history afterward montgomerie complained about the behavior of the fans and of the american players the animosity has never totally subsided after being heckled again in february at the world match play championship in carlsbad calif montgomerie threatened never to play in the united states again he returned in april for the masters however and the be nice to monty campaign was created golf digest got 35000 of the red white and black buttons to pass out at bethpage we were n't trying to be preachy at all o'malley said just cut a guy a break the vast majority of the crowd did just that today the fans at bethpage have been in a festive celebratory mood all week montgomerie who received a loud ovation this morning at the practice tee was the beneficiary of that good feeling today he nevertheless was not very pleased with his round i did n't putt very well he said as bad as my back was i usually could have holed at least four of the putts i missed that would have given me a 71 which would have been acceptable my only birdie was a four footer on the fifth and that was the longest putt i made all day that did not stop the crowd from encouraging montgomerie whose driver featured a head cover resembling the american flag good luck monty could be heard echoing from the gallery as he walked to the 10th tee to begin his round shouts of all right monty go get 'em monty and you da man monty rang out here and there throughout the day not that everyone was rooting for him as montgomerie and his playing partners mark o'meara and craig stadler walked to the 12th hole after montgomerie 's first bogey a fan shouted hey monty do n't choke perhaps the most biting comment came after montgomerie had finished his round with a bogey on the par 4 no 9 knowing that a second round score like today 's might prevent montgomerie from making the cut one fan called out hey monty i 've got mets tickets for sunday
 vice president al gore today proposed expanding social security benefits for widows and parents who took time off from work to care for families asserting that the current rules had unfairly penalized women noting that the social security act was 65 years old mr gore also accused gov george w bush his likely republican opponent of proposing a risky tax cut scheme and other policies that would drain dollars from the retirement system and threaten its long term solvency george w bush seems to think that 65 years of the current social security system is more than enough mr gore said at an event before retirees echoing what is becoming a familiar attack line if he got his hands on america 's retirement system it would quickly become a system of social insecurity mr gore 's proposals would partly end what he called the motherhood penalty under which parents who stop working to raise their children see their retirement benefits slip they would also raise the benefits paid to widows by up to 50 percent the two plans which would raise annual benefits for 11 million people by 600 to 1000 each were considered modest but they gave mr gore an opportunity to praise what he called the magnificent social security system as well as honor women who rear children rather than work outside the home anybody who 's done it knows what hard work it is mr gore said of child rearing should we honor that work of course we should aides to mr gore said his proposals would be financed by the social security surplus now projected at 22 trillion in the coming decade but they would not estimate a cost beyond saying the plans would use less than 5 percent of the surplus or less than 100 billion over 10 years while mr gore courted women voters today his focus on social security also let him underscore what he considers the sharp differences between himself and mr bush on a core democratic program mr gore has called for using the social security surplus to shore up the system now projected to become insolvent by 2037 he contends that mr bush 's plan to cut taxes by 483 billion in five years would force the government to use the surplus to pay for other programs mr bush denies that the texas governor also proposes using the social security surplus to bolster the system unlike mr gore he would let payees invest part of their payroll taxes in stocks to raise returns today mr bush also campaigning in pennsylvania said mr gore had played down the system 's problems there needs to be social security reform to make sure there 's a social security system at all he said this is a system that i believe needs to be fixed social security benefits are based on the number of years a person is employed thus women who stay home for part of their work life to raise children tend to receive lower benefits than men upon retirement mr gore would credit stay at home parents men and women with 16500 in income for up to five years lifting benefits by an average of 600 a year for as many as eight million people his aides said for widows social security benefits are now cut by a third to a half of a couple 's combined benefits mr gore would lift a survivor 's benefits to 75 percent of the couple 's raising them an average of 1000 a year for as many as 3 million people according to his aides

 as many as 1900 queens residents were unknowingly infected with the west nile virus last fall new york city health officials have concluded in the aftermath of the outbreak of the mosquito borne virus that killed 7 people and sickened at least 62 in the new york area extrapolating from a survey in october across a three square mile swath of northern queens the epicenter of last year 's outbreak officials concluded that 533 to 1903 people or about 26 percent of the area 's 46000 residents had been infected with the virus according to survey results released yesterday the officials said they did not consider the results surprising but only a fraction of those infected with the virus nine cases three of them fatal were confirmed in the northern queens hot spot contracted encephalitis which often mimics the flu but infrequently leads to deadly brain swelling illness caused by the west nile virus is typically short lived and can lead to lifelong immunity health department officials said although they were unable to say definitively that exposure guarantees lifelong immunity there is no vaccine to protect against the disease health department officials said yesterday that the survey did not examine the rate of infection for the other boroughs because the virus was most prevalent among birds and mosquitoes in the northern queens epicenter where the outbreak was first detected last august officials said the average percentage of the population found to be infected through anonymous blood sampling was similar to the rate of infection among residents of bucharest romania where there was an outbreak of west nile encephalitis in 1996 the survey involved 677 people who gave blood last fall at mobile health vans parked in the northern queens neighborhoods of whitestone auburndale linden hill and murray hill nineteen of them tested positive for antibodies to the west nile virus that led officials to estimate that 12 percent to 41 percent of the population in that three square mile section had been infected john gadd a spokesman for the health department said none of the 19 people who tested positive for the virus had become seriously ill reporting either no symptoms or mild illness like a low grade fever west nile virus is endemic in africa the middle east and western asia and has periodically emerged in europe but the outbreak in new york city and its suburbs last summer was the first time it had struck the western hemisphere the results of the survey were announced as the city and other towns and counties in new york new jersey and connecticut are bracing for this year 's mosquito season which begins next month the federal centers for disease control and prevention warned earlier this month that the disease would probably recur this year health officials in many municipalities are planning programs to kill mosquito larvae before they hatch in an attempt to avoid a repetition of the aerial insecticide spraying used to control adult mosquito populations last year
 cuddled in santa 's giant arms for a photo gloria perrotta 6 volunteered that she wanted a baby doll for christmas bouncing up and down in line waiting for his turn brady nunez 6 said he was wishing for incredible hulk hands his brother orlando nieves 11 who is deaf quickly signed to his mother michelle texiera that he wanted blue and red sneakers but that gray ones with a red nike swoosh were ok too fortunately none of the dozens of children waiting for this santa seemed prepared to ask for what he could not give to free their mothers from rikers island this holiday season new york city estimates that it has in its foster care program more than 150 children of women being held at rikers island and although most of the women who rotate through the medium  and low security jail will be there months instead of years city officials say they are acutely aware of the grief such separation causes the children particularly at this time of year to try to ease the pain and to make the expected reunification of mothers and children smoother the city invited inmates children to a christmas party at the women 's jail at rikers last week it was the fourth such christmas party to be held despite the soft carols coming from the stereo and enough candy canes for all the elves at the north pole there was no disguising the jailhouse ambience sparse strands of gold tinsel decorated the concrete block walls appetizers of cheese puffs and barbecued potato chips were served on paper plates the mothers were dressed in gray department of correction jumpsuits still many of the women said they were grateful to be having the party sherry heyward has been at rikers for 15 months last year she did not know about the party and she sorely missed her children at christmas this year she sat in a tight circle with cyheme 15 and shanasia 11 her son and daughter who bear a striking resemblance to her it is so much better so much better than nothing at all ms heyward said technically inmates have long had the same rights to see their children once a month and participate in decisions about their care as other mothers whose children are in temporary foster care but until recently the logistics of traveling to rikers which is not served by a subway were complicated enough that many social workers did not routinely make the trip foster care administrators worried that this would strain the ties between parents and children making reunification less likely or less successful four years ago the administration for children 's services joined with the correction department to develop a program to help make visiting rikers easier the city leased vans and hired drivers and the correction department set aside a time just for family visits and space that was child friendly meaning an area that did not have barbed wire or iron bars the children of incarcerated parents program as it was named allowed for monthly visits and four holiday parties each year culminating in a three hour christmas party long before the children arrived the women started gathering in the party room just inside the security gate when there was no sign of the children at 10 minutes past the hour the women chanted we want our kids finally the bus arrived but there was more waiting while officials did a careful inventory to make sure that there was a mother for every set of children and vice versa obviously this is such an emotional thing we have to be careful said maclean guthrie a spokeswoman for the administration for children 's services the children were led slowly through the metal detector and to their mothers the youngest looked dazed one little girl in a brilliant red sweater with velvet trim would not leave her social worker and screamed as her mother approached gloria perrotta 's mother lorez williams who is serving time for assaulting a man with a box cutter sat silently with her most reunions went well ms texiera 's boys could not take their hands off her while brady twisted one side of his mother 's hair into knots orlando used his fingers to comb through the other side and he signed to his mother that she should comb it more often to make it softer the water is hard in here she told him soon after the party began santa arrived hot dogs and baked chicken were served and families relaxed the space was small and each clan settled into a tight little circle and leaned in to be heard above the increasing noise for mothers who see their children only once a month much needs to be done between hot dogs and candy canes after lunch ms texiera pinned orlando down in a chair and signed what was coming next for the family mommy is going to be released in january but that does not mean we can live together she explained with her hands according to the translator i have to go into an 18 month program but if it goes well we can live together soon as part of her sentence ms texiera must live 18 months in a halfway house which does not allow children she said she was afraid that her son would see her out of jail and think that she did not want to be with him she would not say why she was in jail by the time the cake was served some of the children were ricocheting off the walls one 2 year old dashed out of the room and got to the main door where a security guard stopped him other children began to settle down gloria lay quietly in her mother 's arms they were silent holding each other tight around the neck marlene jimenez 33 who had all five of her children visiting found herself yelling at her son kevin osorio 4 to behave and cleaning up after her 5 month old david jimenez who spit up all over her daughter sylvia jimenez 9 it was like this at home she said i never sit down all day until they all go to sleep abruptly the warden said it was time to go mothers stay to clean up she added there were kisses lingering hugs and for some pails of tears ms texiera held orlando so hard it seemed she would break his shoulders he

 to the editor thursday morning quarterbacks editorial nov 7 points out that democrats need to figure out what they stand for i would like to give my party a suggestion we believe in individual liberty and corporate accountability we believe that people less fortunate than ourselves deserve our help we believe in justice peace and due process of law these are not radical notions they are the fundamental values that motivate people to choose the democratic party when democrats play these down for political expedience they lose the support of liberal voters and gain the contempt of everyone it 's time for the democratic party to reclaim the moral high ground and give the american people a choice we can believe in brian denny berkeley calif nov 7 2002
 as a general rule the better the restaurant the longer it takes to hit its stride when the place has lofty ambitions as atelier does the general rule becomes an iron law what is a critic to do common sense says to wait say six months before writing a review let the chef and the rest of the team find their footing in the real world however common sense is nonsense readers can not wait indefinitely forks at the ready to get the lowdown on an important new restaurant the critic 's job is to get a review to the table while it 's still hot when i visited atelier shortly after it opened in the spring of last year it was already a fine restaurant the executive chef gabriel kreuther had a very distinctive style classically french but quite fresh and modern with an ingenious use of herbs to create new flavors the kitchen 's shortcomings were precisely those one might expect given a cuisine marked by subtlety refinement and precision some dishes seemed a little blurry and unfocused others seemed slightly out of register or a few degrees off center but the promise was there the only thing atelier needed was the thing that no critic can give which was more time a little more than year later atelier has firmly established itself as one of the city 's finest french restaurants there 's simply no question about it mr kreuther continues to come up with dazzling ideas achieving exciting flavor effects through unexpected means he excels at lighter than air herb based sauces that shine a new flattering light on the main ingredients of a dish a bright basil jus freshened with pea shoots brings out the almost fulsome richness of foie gras without resorting to the usual fruit chutneys compotes or syrups that can weigh down an already dangerously heavy ingredient the musky penetrating flavor of licorice root is a like a sexy perfume applied with a delicate touch to a pristine block of east coast halibut a salad of new onions celery and almonds evens out the equation with a touch of asperity and sweetness fennel orange salad combining an aromatic vegetal note with sweet but acidic fruit flavor perfectly suits roasted langoustines sprinkled with sesame seeds mr kreuther 's range is impressive his menu embraces minimalist spa dishes like steamed black sea bass in a lemon verbena jus and a punchy explosively flavorful oxtail crepinette stuffed with wild mushrooms and coated almost like a candy apple in a sticky syrupy reduction it 's a profound meat experience as though a 20 ounce rib eye has been compressed into a container the size of a squash ball weaving in and out of the menu are dishes that read like exercises in whimsy but turn out to have the irrefutable logic of a mathematical theorem champagne sauce has the deceptive tensile strength of a spider web sweet and slightly piquant it stands up to a muscular slab of wild salmon coated in a hot horseradish crust perhaps most impressive is the featherweight fines herbes jus pooled around slices of pink muscovy duck baked in a clay papillote as with the seared foie gras mr kreuther reveals the flavor of his main ingredients without resorting to the usual syrups and fruit sauces he has a talent for confounding expectations several dishes have kept their place on the menu for obvious reasons toasted flour soup is a rustic appetizer with a smoky even baconlike flavor frog legs cut into tender lumps the size of gnocchi bob in the soup their sweetness nicely offset by the sharp bite of fresh onion sprouts rabbit and riesling a classic combination gets a neat twist at atelier where the rabbit is cooked with riesling and hyssop a highly aromatic herb with a resemblance to thyme and formed into a terrine it 's served in neat slices with a fines herbes coulis and there will never be a valid excuse for dropping this appetizer from the menu the dining room is quiet and civilized that has been true from the outset but the service now feels much more assured and relaxed there is a definite style now at the city 's top french restaurants a french american hybrid that developed in reaction to the stuffy rulebound service mandatory at michelin starred paris restaurants without sacrificing efficiency or expertise it takes the starch out of fine dining waiters and sommeliers interact more freely with customers in a freer easier american style restaurant daniel has brought this style to absolute perfection and atelier has clearly signed onto the program it is committed to delivering luxury and indulgence but the experience like the sauces never weighs heavily the restaurant has a new pastry chef eric hubert who like mr kreuther is a graduate of jean georges he 's a bit of a showboat and a magpie too having cooked or done consulting work for restaurants as various as vong patria and typhoon his more flamboyant impulses play well against mr kreuther 's highly disciplined cuisine atelier is a hotel restaurant a setting that almost demands fireworks on the dessert plate as well as a sense of fun mr hubert delivers lots of both whether it 's a carved ice pedestal for two scoops of ice cream or the fancifully named strawberry game a checkerboard of strawberry flavored agar with a strawberry tart and a shallow pool of strawberry water his cherry sampler is a whirlwind tour of cherry flavors expressed in gradations from tart to very sweet in a vacherin a terrific clafoutis a savarin and amusingly in a little scoop of chopped up relish billed as a tartare you have to laugh cherry tartare seems ridiculous yet perfect for atelier whose refined aesthetic places a premium on pure pleasure and the shock of the unexpected it 's a difficult combination to master but mr kreuther has done it with total assurance all he needed was a chance to warm up atelier rating

 gray davis the embattled governor of california is getting an unwanted lesson in speech pathology namely how difficult it is to say you 're sorry with your foot in your mouth on saturday during a union rally governor davis took a swipe at the chunky austrian accent of his republican rival the actor arnold schwarzenegger you should n't be governor unless you can pronounce the name of the state mr davis wisecracked to a supporter according to a report in the sacramento bee the comment has caused a stir in a state that is home to nine million immigrants many of whom support mr davis a democrat the governor asked to explain himself sunday after the mexican independence day parade in east los angeles said i was just joking around with someone in the crowd still he has not issued an apology and his wife sharon said on television this morning that mr schwarzenegger should just take it as a joke and move on mr schwarzenegger was also supposed to attend the parade as grand marshal but the invitation was withdrawn at the request of some prominent democrats who believe he is hostile toward illegal immigrants speaking instead at a youth awards ceremony in a latino neighborhood on sunday mr schwarzenegger turned mr davis 's remarks to his advantage he does n't like the way i say the word california because i say cal ee fornia rather than cal a fornia mr schwarzenegger said but there 's many other words that he does n't like lost jobs he does n't like that word he does n't like blackout he does n't like energy crisis and he definitely does n't like recall so those are words that he just does n't like you know actually mr schwarzenegger enunciates the word california more closely to its true spanish root than does mr davis a native new yorker who uses the anglicized version while mr schwarzenegger did not call for an apology the state republicans did gray davis owes every californian an apology for his insensitive remarks about immigrants who come to this country speaking with an accent said mario rodriguez vice chairman of the california republican party it is preposterous to suggest that nonnative english speakers and those with accents are unqualified to lead our state lt gov cruz bustamante the grandson of mexican immigrants felt it was better today to say nothing than defend mr davis the bilingual mr bustamante who says he will vote no on the recall and yes for himself as the replacement governor has in recent appearances spoken like a man who wants mr davis 's job i need your vote for governor mr bustamante told a hometown crowd in fresno on sunday he has also at times criticized the governor 's leadership abilities for the record mr bustamante pronounces it cal a fornia when speaking english and cal ee for nee a when speaking spanish
 to the editor nicholas d kristof column april 8 asks why the world does n't accept the bush administration 's word about the war in iraq the white house sowed the seeds of contempt when it unilaterally exited treaties and adopted its exclusionary you 're with us or against us rhetoric the administration further spurred the growth of distrust with its rigid diplomatic edicts and its disdainful criticism of the united nations it should be no wonder that the world is reluctant to consume the bitter fruit borne of these methods gary nowak elmhurst ill april 8 2003
 brushing aside objections from labor advocates and human rights campaigners the world trade organization formally agreed today to hold the group 's next top level meeting in autumn in doha the capital of the persian gulf state of qatar the meeting 's dates will be set next month the doha meeting is the subject of increasing international attention because momentum is building for a proposal to begin a new multiyear round of global trade talks there the big industrial countries of western europe generally favor starting the new round which had been scheduled to start at the last major meeting in seattle in december 1999 that meeting drew unexpectedly disruptive street protests and talks never got off the ground partly because of american insistence that environmental and labor standards two major concerns of the antiglobalization protesters be included in the new trade round european union officials met with more than a dozen countries in geneva today to explore the feasibility of restarting the process in doha after remarks by the european commission president romano prodi at the world economic forum in davos last week that he hoped talks could begin later this year a spokesman for the european union said its officials would like to sound out developing countries about the feasibility of a new round but the union would prefer to establish a separate forum for discussion of the relationship between trade and social development issues to permit the trade talks to proceed unburdened by the kinds of disputes seen at the seattle meeting the choice of doha as a site was made by a consensus of the 140 nation trade organization and widely backed by the developing nations who predominate in the group but it drew criticism partly because of authoritarian qatar 's human rights record and the difficulty of organizing protests there on anything like the scale of those in seattle in response officials in qatar have pledged to allow unfettered access to the country during the conference and to permit demonstrations a rare sight in the conservative country as long as they are peaceful the nongovernmental organizations accredited to the seattle meeting will also be accredited to doha said mike moore the director general of the wto correction february 1 2001 thursday a picture caption in world business yesterday with an article about the selection of qatar 's capital for a top level meeting of the world trade organization gave an erroneous identification from agence france presse for the official shown he was sheik hamad bin jassim bin jabr al thani foreign minister of qatar not sheik hamad bin khalifa al thani the emir
 to the editor after reading m h reed 's review of equus in today 's paper feb 11 i found two glaring omissions service and wine selection how can a rating be given to a restaurant without mentioning the service the only points covered in the review were the grounds outside the restaurant and the food the lack of mention of wine selection is truly amazing as equus was recognized by the wine spectator for its wine cellar we in westchester deserve more lorrie karam dobbs ferry
 not since the 1970 's when grape workers and the anti apartheid movement were holy causes for millions of americans have so many groups embraced the boycott as a weapon in the most prominent boycott in years the naacp has called on tourists and conventions to shun south carolina to pressure that state to remove the confederate flag atop its capitol also facing an naacp boycott the adam 's mark luxury hotel chain agreed last week to pay 8 million seek minority customers and give its employees diversity training to get the boycott dropped and to settle race discrimination lawsuits brought by some offended black guests and the justice department gay groups have proposed a boycott of paramount over a planned television show starring dr laura schlessinger who has called homosexuals biological errors and sexual deviants groups seeking to restore democracy to burma are sponsoring boycotts against best western unocal suzuki and other companies that do business there among the companies that labor unions are boycotting is kaiser aluminum which locked out 2900 unionized workers 14 months ago and the southern baptist convention is pressing a boycott against disney charging that it is too sympathetic to gays the times may be ripe for more consumer boycotts said jeff faux executive director of the economic policy institute a research group in washington we have more of a consumer culture and people see themselves more as consumers today while people are participating less in the political process as consumers they see that one way they can exercise power is by where they spend their money and where they do n't the boycott takes its name from an economic war waged by irish farmers in the 1880 's against an english land agent charles cunningham boycott who refused demands to cut rents during a time of poor crops their subsequent refusal to work his land or sell him goods forced him to return to england in the late 1880 's american farmers were already shunning railroads charging exorbitant rates in 1885 alone american labor unions carried out 196 official boycotts one boycott that made a profound impression on 20th century america was the montgomery bus boycott which came after rosa parks famously refused to sit in the back of the bus in 1955 because she was black since then civil rights activists have repeatedly embraced boycotts two months ago the television networks agreed to increase minority hiring after the naacp threatened a boycott charging that few shows featured minority actors but sometimes boycotts which require organization and consumer awareness fail most americans do not realize that the united farm workers 1984 grape boycott remains in force begun when growers refused to sign new union contracts it has largely failed because the union stopped promoting it when it failed to catch on union officials say it remains in effect because lifting the boycott would give a victory to the grape growers in sharp contrast the original boycott called by cesar chavez in 1967 persuaded millions of americans to give up grapes and pressured california growers to recognize unionized workers and raise wages boycotts can hurt the very people they intend to help when anti sweatshop groups threatened a boycott against apparel from bangladesh in the mid 1990 's because many factories employed child labor the factories simply fired the children pushing some into begging and prostitution anti sweatshop groups now generally oppose boycotts the naacp 's president kweisi mfume said his group never rushes into boycotts this is a trigger you do n't want to pull until all else has failed he said in the case of south carolina after 38 years of negotiating even the naacp has a limit to its patience as a result the south carolina chamber of commerce says more than 100 conventions and other events have been canceled in the state which has lost at least 18 million in tourist dollars but howard hunter jr the chamber 's president said the boycott might backfire because it has caused some lawmakers to dig in one group of legislators he said has used the boycott very effectively for not taking action saying 'we 're being blackmailed if we succumb this time what are they going to ask for next the business community mr hunter said has been working to resolve the problem looking for less controversial tools than a boycott to pressure paramount to drop its dr laura plans gay groups have deluged the corporation with calls and e mail paramount would never host a talk show where someone said such nasty things about blacks or jews said john aravosis who has organized the stopdrlauracom web site companies react to boycotts with either compliance or defiance after several groups boycotted pepsi over its burma ties the company stopped doing business there when customers and consumers contact us we definitely listen said david de cecco a pepsi spokesman who added that the company 's action was consistent with american foreign policy but unocal has reacted differently to a boycott over its investment in a natural gas consortium in burma we sympathize with the boycott 's goals said michael thatcher a unocal spokesman we want to see democracy and economic improvement in myanmar we feel that the way we 're doing it is much more likely to bear positive results than their way which is to pull out and isolate the country during the south africa boycott the apartheid regime made similar arguments saying sanctions were hurting the nation 's blacks in particular but archbishop desmond tutu rejected those arguments saying you get all sorts of people saying all sorts of things about sanctions that they will hurt the people you are trying to help twiddle it 's baloney of the first order because you are speaking about people already suffering and you are saying you are trying to find some way that is a nonviolent strategy for bringing about the change that everybody says they want
 on monday night the new york philharmonic made one of its infrequent visits to the place it used to call home carnegie hall the orchestra had not played there in two years many people within the organization must rue the day that the orchestra was tempted with the prospect of having its own spanking new concert hall in lincoln center philharmonic hall as it was initially called did not turn out well after several major renovations and a name change yet another reconstruction project is being planned to make avery fisher hall an acoustically rewarding place so it must be a joy for the philharmonic musicians to perform at carnegie with its splendid sound for the occasion kurt masur picked two works that promised to show him and his orchestra at their best shostakovich 's first and bruckner 's fourth symphonies under these circumstances it was puzzling that the performances especially that of the bruckner were somewhat unsettled mr masur responds intuitively to the serenity and spaciousness of bruckner 's music with other german romantic composers brahms especially there can be an overly emphatic quality to his interpretations but calm authority pervades his performances of bruckner as in the magisterial account of the fourth symphony he conducted in may at avery fisher hall the problem on monday could have been that the orchestra had not completely adjusted to carnegie hall 's resonant acoustics at fisher hall the players must work hard for clarity and detail at carnegie hall extra effort can backfire too often volleys of brass hunting calls and bass ostinatos leapt out from the overall texture in an unruly way the first horn is almost like a concerto soloist in the first movement of this work and philip myers played with considerable expressivity yet he sounded tentative as if afraid of sticking out too much in this reverberant space mr masur had some trouble maintaining steady tempos in the long expanses of the first movement still mr masur has such an affinity for this work and the players know it so well that there were many rewarding qualities to their account the wistful andante movement had a lovely schubertian lilt the scherzo was crisp and punchy if at times a little careless and mr masur managed to bring cohesion to the finale which even ardent brucknerians concede is structurally rambling the orchestra sounded confident in the shostakovich an audacious sassy brilliant work completed before the composer had turned 20 the performance bristled with vitality ms masur conveyed the brash humor of the music as in the sloshing tipsy waltz episode of the first movement without ever letting it turn sarcastic
 britain redoubled its already draconian efforts to eradicate foot and mouth disease after a report projected that the number of affected sites instead of tailing off would soon rise by 70 each day and would top 4000 by june a government scientist said the disease is out of control because of a delay between discovering the virus 's presence and the slaughter of infected and exposed animals the crisis is threatening prime minister tony blair 's plan to seek re election
 a long strike at a nestle plant in south korea came to an end on friday but the fear of labor unrest continues to loom over the south korean economy south korea has been roiled by strikes this year that have come even as unions face dwindling public support amid a slow economy labor experts say the south korean government has tried to persuade unions to tone down their tactics of strikes and plant occupations concerned that such militancy will make it more difficult to attract foreign investment indeed recent data showed foreign direct investment in south korea fell almost 20 percent in the third quarter of this year a fourth consecutive quarter of decline but the government of president roh moo hyun has not had much success because of a lingering distrust of the government and employers as a result of oppressive policies in the past labor experts say nestle korea 's 460 union employees went on strike after a decision by the company to outsource parts of its sales operations and after management sought to transfer some workers to new positions the decision alarmed unionized workers who viewed the changes as a precursor to layoffs nestle said on friday that the 145 day strike ended after the union accepted a management offer for wage increases and the participation of labor in deciding layoffs nestle which accounts for 40 percent of south korea 's coffee market said earlier that the union 's demand for a say in decisions involving layoffs had encroached upon the rights of management only 12 percent of south korea 's 23 million workers belong to unions organized under two large nationwide labor groups and strikes at foreign companies in south korea account for less than 10 percent of the 308 incidents of labor unrest in the country so far this year according to the labor ministry but unionized workers still wield considerable power because of their ability to mobilize nationwide support through their parent organizations according to kim keum soo a labor expert and the head of a committee of government business and labor representatives set up in the late 1990 's unions are responding more aggressively than before to the threats posed by businesses seeking to rationalize their operations amid changing global conditions mr kim said workers have also become resentful of the president who many laborers had expected to support them mr roh a former labor activist and lawyer who crusaded for human rights entered office this year on a populist platform but fearing further damage to foreign investor sentiment the president has vowed to deal sternly with violent protests
 as south africa and the european union scrambled tonight to salvage a united nations conference on racism here the delegates who had gathered from across the world were trying to figure out what went wrong and how the south african government presented revised drafts of the proposed conference declaration and action plan tonight to a team of european union negotiators headed by belgium the europeans are hoping to get a final statement accepted that does not have the criticisms of israel that led american and israeli officials to withdraw from the conference on monday whether the negotiators will find an acceptable compromise remains to be seen but some diplomats here said the conference was doomed from the start because its organizers failed to resolve the prickly issues before the meeting opened last week the issues were even a concern in the united states from the earliest days of the bush administration page a8 four weeks ago mary robinson the united nations commissioner for human rights stood before a crowd of anxious diplomats in geneva and reassured them that the meeting was on track the arabs were compromising on language that sharply criticized israel she said the americans were negotiating and within days the news was flashing around the world zionism scrapped from racism summit agenda one headline said the meeting which was intended to raise the world 's consciousness about intolerance of all forms was going to be a success but some diplomats left that meeting in geneva shaking their heads they knew trouble was looming a seven page compromise plan presented by the arab league in august had eliminated the word zionist but kept references to the racist practices of the occupying power negotiators assigned to ease american and israeli concerns often lacked political clout and as bombs exploded and tanks rolled in the middle east some palestinians and israelis dug in their heels and refused to bargain seriously even though time was running out on monday the united states and israel walked out of the racism conference denouncing hateful language in a proposed declaration that condemns israel today as the americans flew out of this city officials from the united nations and south africa expressed shock and regret and moved quickly to consider new language but diplomats familiar with the negotiations say mrs robinson the conference coordinator south african officials and others have known for months that trouble was brewing united nations officials insisted publicly last month that the zionism equals racism phrase was dead but they were still building a conference around draft documents that described israel 's treatment of the palestinians as a new kind of apartheid and despite talk from both sides about the need for compromise there was precious little room to maneuver the palestinians supported by the south africans and arab nations insisted that their suffering be included in any declaration about discrimination israel supported by the united states and european countries insisted that it should not be the only country singled out for intolerance in a general document that condemns discrimination across the world today the belgian foreign minister louis michel and the south african foreign minister dr nkosazana zuma were actively involved in the negotiations to eliminate the wording that western countries have found offensive officials said some critics say that such senior officials should have been deeply involved in the rewriting of sensitive language long before the conference opened here on friday they blamed poor management and a shortage of political will among negotiating countries for the lingering stalemate we knew we had to face the problem in geneva but everybody avoided it swept it under the carpet said a european diplomat who was involved in last ditch negotiations this week to keep the united states and israel from pulling out people knew this would be very difficult a mission impossible or a mission extremely difficult said the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity if one question could lead to great complications in durban that would be the middle east other issues are simmering here of course and several countries are using their political influence to keep them off the agenda the united states for instance has objected to language in the conference declaration that describes slavery as a crime against humanity fearing that it might be faced with lawsuits by the descendants of slaves some european countries have objected to the suggestion that they offer an apology for colonialism india has lobbied against any mention of its untouchables the underclass that is sometimes deprived of land ownership and required to drink and eat from separate utensils but no other topic has been as sensitive as the question of whether israel should be singled out for condemnation it has been a contentious issue since february when officials gathering for a united nations meeting in tehran proposed a declaration that assailed israel 's treatment of palestinians as a new kind of apartheid and by early august only weeks before the conference opened all sides were still deadlocked geneva should have dealt with a lot of the problems before we got to durban a senior south african official said in an interview today we 're only started now getting into the nitty gritty last week secretary of state colin l powell formally announced that he would not attend the conference because the dispute remained unresolved the united states sent a midlevel delegation to negotiate instead those talks broke down on monday when arab nations rejected a compromise proposed by norway and supported by the united states and israel the draft eliminated all phrases like racist settler ideology and racist practices of zionism but it also eliminated any reflection of the palestinian suffering the new negotiating team which includes representatives from south africa belgium norway namibia and the arab league plans to complete its deliberations tomorrow today mrs robinson said she believed that a chance still existed to salvage the conference by coming up with some consensus on language describing the middle east conflict she said she believed that the team would develop a declaration against racism that could be supported by all nations i believe we 're back on course mrs robinson said everybody knows time is short we 've come a long long way to get here

 though its drive to build a national missile defense is barely under way the bush administration has already managed to shift the focus of the european security debate despite deep seated hopes that the missile defense issue would just go away european officials now seem to accept grudgingly the fact that the new american team is determined to move ahead the new mood was evident at a two day conference here which brought together top security officials and defense experts from europe the united states and asia no ranking europeans officials rushed to grab defense secretary donald h rumsfeld 's offer to help the european allies deploy their own missile defenses but there were no fiery dissents either none of this means that the matter has been put to rest what it does mean is that the debate is entering a new phase in which the issue is more how the united states should go about developing missile defenses than whether it should try the diplomatic and technological questions are more pressing than ever and they could yet affect the debate in both the united states and europe it is still unclear whether the pentagon can overcome the technological hurdles for an effective missile defense and even if it does it could take the better part of a decade to start putting such a system in place but the political costs must be paid up front that is because the united states will need to amend or jettison the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty to embark on a serious testing and development program that means coping with russia 's and china 's anxieties that washington has embarked on a quest for strategic dominance and it means reassuring the europeans that the bush administration is attuned to the concerns of its allies and has not embarked on a go it alone strategy the administration is still in its early days but it clearly has yet to produce a diplomatic strategy to accompany its missile defense plan mr rumsfeld for instance barely mentioned russia in his saturday address to the conference and what he did say consisted of little more than the assertion that with a sizable nuclear arsenal moscow had no reason to be concerned about a limited missile defense the russians provided no openings either seeking to rouse european sentiment against the administration 's plan sergei ivanov the head of president vladimir v putin 's security council warned that it would ignite an arms race in space and undermine the entire edifice of arms control agreements it will result in the annihilation of the whole structure of strategic stability and create the prerequisites for a new arms race mr ivanov said though neither spoke in a confrontational tone the two speeches recalled the superpower jousting of the cold war the battleground was again european public opinion only this time there appears to a general acknowledgment that moscow 's influence has waned it was left to senator joseph i lieberman the former democratic candidate for vice president and a supporter of missile defense to raise the possibility of cooperating with the russians and it was another missile defense supporter senator john mccain the arizona republican and former presidential aspirant who suggested that the united states broaden its strategic agenda by reconsidering ratification of the international treaty banning nuclear tests while reasonable men can differ about the merits of that treaty mr mccain said verification measures should be improved before it was reconsidered by the senate it was an effort to present a security policy that embraced both arms control as well as missile defense during the election campaign george w bush signaled that he would push for deeper perhaps one sided cuts in long range nuclear arms those proposals will take time to develop and the europeans are looking for more than cuts in the american arsenal they want to preserve much of the existing framework of arms control treaties for those who favor cooperation with moscow much will depend on what type of missile defenses the administration designs mr lieberman touted a boost phase system in which interceptors based on ships would be used to shoot down missiles soon after they were launched the system would be far more palatable to the russians than a space based defense in part because it could not down missiles launched from russia 's heartland the russians in fact have proposed a similar approach but the bush administration has talked about developing a system that can also defend against an accidental or unauthorized launching that makes it very unlikely that it will limit itself to a boost phase defense and makes reconciling arms control with a missile shield much more of a challenge administration officials said today that they recognized that they would have to get around to dealing with moscow but they say they wanted to start by consulting with the allies a step mr rumsfeld took when he offered to help the europeans deploy their own missile defenses the primary european concern however seems to be to keep relations with russia on an even keel the europeans seem to see little benefit from missile defense at least in the near term and have little enthusiasm for spending the billions of dollars it would take to build one washington also has a stake in trying to avoid a diplomatic confrontation with moscow without the russians the united states may find it difficult to continue its programs to protect nuclear materials in russia or to press russia to crack down on the export of missile and nuclear technology as for china if the united states can not ease worries there beijing may speed up efforts to modernize its arsenal of 18 land based missiles a development that american intelligence has warned could set off an arms race including india and pakistan though administration officials do not have the answers yet they insist that a comprehensive policy will be produced their diplomatic strategy for now is watch this space we understand that there is a lot of work to do with the allies a lot of work to do with the russians condoleezza rice president bush 's national security adviser told cnn today but we believe that with the proper context and with the chance to do the diplomacy that we can make this work
 any other tale so thick with intrigue involving a nazi war criminal and treasure hidden in the depths of a blue green sea might simply have been dismissed particularly if it originated from a prison inmate known only as phantom x but the prospect of 50 sealed chests heavy with gold coins and jewels valued at as much as 2 billion is enough to make a believer out of almost anyone including an international diving team the greek government and this country 's senior jewish council after months of dispute and delays greek and french divers are hoping to plunge this week into nearly 300 feet of water off the southwest peloponnesus near kalamata on an expedition to salvage what they hope is just such a fortune the wealth was reputedly stripped from jews sent to labor and death camps and then stashed at a secret underwater location by dr max merten who was hitler 's senior administrator in salonika in northern greece during world war ii but even before an ounce of gold has been brought to the surface the mere prospect of such a fortune has set greece 's notorious bureaucracy in motion and sent a long line of claimants jostling for their stakes the situation is crazy said gregoire koulbanis a 40 year old swiss diver of greek descent who is to lead and film the expedition such chaos delays and state of hysteria i 've never witnessed in my 20 year career mr koulbanis who gained fame on some of the most daring expeditions of jacques yves cousteau the late oceanographer said he was told of the treasure 10 months ago by a 63 year old man he refuses to identify but whom the greek media are calling phantom x the man who is in prison for a string of felonies says he learned of the treasure when he shared a greek prison cell with dr merten in 1958 the former nazi officer fled to germany after world war ii but returned to greece that year supposedly to check up on his fortune he was arrested tried for war crimes and jailed in athens according to the greek foreign ministry and the central jewish council which represents 3000 jews in greece dr merten the informant claims to have been told stowed 50 cases of gold he intended to return to after the war a nazi submarine he says ferried the treasure from northern greece to the southern peloponnesus from there dr merten commissioned a fishing boat named sofia to carry the cases to a designated site and sank the vessel a presidential decree in 1959 allowed dr merten to return to germany where he practiced law and died in 1976 it remains unclear whether he had ever tried to retrieve the treasure again the current expedition which was supposed to take place over the weekend is now scheduled for friday after being put off by local officials in kalamata they said the summer holiday season had left them too short handed to oversee a multimillion dollar search by 30 divers and crew members mr koulbanis the head of the expedition attributes the delays to outrageous demands by the local authorities and a swamp of bureaucracy despite having gained approval for the dive from foreign minister george papandreou this month the kalamata authorities say they want extra assurances that the state will get the 50 percent share it has claimed if the fortune is found this may prove the biggest treasure to surface from this part of the greek sea says christos vrillias a senior local official responsible for protecting state property we have to safeguard the state 's interests to the fullest in that effort the kalamata authorities demand that a special state committee climb aboard the search vessel to monitor every inch of the dive by video link from the deep they also want coast guard vessels to be placed on alert a team of archaeologists ready to appraise the fortune which is to be handled by greek divers only and finance ministry experts to store whatever is recovered in special vaults at the national bank of greece since the operation may sweep through a military shooting range greek air force units will also be at the ready holocaust survivors argue that at least part of the treasure is rightfully theirs particularly since much of it appears to have been taken from the families of 9000 jews who were later rounded up on dr merten 's orders to work at nazi labor camps in greece i alone had to pay him 1000 gold british sterling in hope of winning my father 's release from one of those camps said andreas sefihas a holocaust survivor and president of the jewish council in salonika some 50000 jews 95 percent of salonika 's jews eventually perished in nazi death camps but the greek state 's claim may leave living greek holocaust survivors with less than a 25 percent share with the remaining 25 percent going to the man who says he knows where the treasure can be found the agreement was negotiated by the informant 's lawyer alexandros lykourezos a leading criminal attorney whose clients have also included the most notorious men wanted for war crimes in bosnia the jewish council plans to contest the state 's 50 percent claim calling this an extraordinary case but before a single coin is handed over to the central jewish council says emmanuel gounaris of the greek foreign ministry it must prove that the fortune had been owned by jews this is n't restitution said mr sefihas head of the jewish council it 's a denial of history as for the diving team mr koulbanis says all are here on their own time at their own expenses their payment will come from the profits mr koulbanis hopes to make from documentary film rights which he has worked out with a french company called timing mr koulbanis has said he is confident that the treasure lies in greek waters but despite all the careful planning legal wrangling and deal making that has led up to the dive mr gounaris who is head of the commission responsible for reviewing underwater explorations warned that should the treasure be found beyond greece 's six mile territorial waters or within international waters different laws apply
 the issue of discrimination in jury selection returned to the supreme court today 16 years after the justices specified procedures for detecting the unconstitutional practice of picking or excluding jurors on the basis of race that landmark 1986 ruling batson v kentucky has been working imperfectly defense lawyers say because the court has not yet made clear how trial judges are to evaluate a prosecutor 's assertion that the removal of a substantial number of black prospective jurors was unrelated to race seth p waxman arguing on behalf of a texas death row inmate thomas miller el told the justices today that it was surpassingly important for the court to use this case to demonstrate how the batson decision 's abstract rules were supposed to work in practice mr waxman urged the justices to rule that it was objectively unreasonable for the judge at mr miller el 's 1986 trial to accept the prosecutor 's explanation that the removal of 10 of 11 black prospective jurors was based on a valid perception that they would hesitate to impose the death penalty and not on their race mr miller el who is black was convicted of killing a hotel clerk during a 1985 robbery at a holiday inn near the dallas fort worth airport the dallas county prosecutor 's office at the time had a long history of excluding black jurors under a policy that some years earlier had been incorporated into an official training manual around the time of mr miller el 's trial the dallas morning news published the results of a study of 100 randomly selected felony trials under the headline race bias pervades jury selection prosecutors routinely bar blacks study finds but the defense failed to persuade the trial judge to evaluate the prosecutor 's jury selection methods in light of that larger context mr miller el 's conviction was upheld by the texas state courts and the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit in new orleans ruled last year that his petition for a writ of habeas corpus did not even qualify for a hearing he was within a week of a scheduled execution last feb 15 when the supreme court granted a stay and agreed to hear his case miller el v cockrell no 01 7662 the court then appointed mr waxman a former solicitor general who is now in private practice to represent mr miller el the texas defender service also represents him in the argument today gena a bunn chief of the texas attorney general 's capital litigation division told the court that the lower courts findings of an absence of purposeful discrimination in the jury selection were fully supported by the record and are entitled to deference ms bunn conceded that the prosecutor asked more probing questions of most black potential jurors than of most whites read from different scripts in mr waxman 's words but said the different treatment was based not on race but on answers the potential jurors gave on their juror questionnaires and during initial questioning ms bunn 's assertion that evidence of the prosecution 's use of race in other jury selections while not completely irrelevant was little better than circumstantial met with objections from several justices why is n't this very significant evidence to which we must give great weight justice anthony m kennedy asked adding the best evidence is often circumstantial ms bunn replied the only question is why the prosecution struck these jurors in this case justice ruth bader ginsburg said that there can never be a successful batson challenge with such a narrow field of inquiry the prosecution could always give a neutral reason justice ginsburg said the question troubling me is what in the end did the court consider her reference was to the so called stage 3 in an inquiry under batson v kentucky in the first stage one side typically the defense demonstrates facts that unless there is an explanation to the contrary indicate a likelihood that race has been used in the jury selection at the second stage the other side puts forward the race neutral reasons for its actions at the final third stage the judge weighs the evidence and decides whether to accept the explanation though the argument today concerned a death penalty case the same formula applies to all cases in which a question is raised about jury selection in a second argument today the court examined the consequences of a decision by congress 10 years ago to bar the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms from reinstating gun ownership rights to felons under federal law a felony convictions brings with it a firearms disability making it illegal to own or carry a gun the law gave the secretary of the treasury the authority to waive the disability if warranted by the person 's record or the circumstances of the crime the secretary in turn delegated that authority to the bureau a unit of the treasury department ten years ago after a study by the violence policy center a gun control group showed that the bureau was restoring gun privileges to many felons who went on to commit new crimes congress passed an appropriations measure to bar the bureau from spending its money to process any applications for waivers the measure has been renewed annually two years ago a federal judge in beaumont tex acting on his own restored the gun privileges of thomas lamar bean a licensed firearms dealer who was convicted by mexico of transporting 200 rounds of ammunition across the boarder mr bean had been attending a gun show in laredo tex and neglected to remove the ammunition from his car the fifth circuit upheld the judge 's action in the government 's appeal united states v bean no 01 704 deputy solicitor general edwin s kneedler argued that the judge joe fisher had no jurisdiction judges can set aside the actions by federal agencies only if the action was arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law mr kneedler said but the refusal to process mr bean 's application he continued was not contrary to law it was compelled by law from their questions and comments most justices appeared to agree with the government 's position arguing for mr bean thomas c goldstein said congress barred only the bureau and not the treasury secretary himself from acting on applications the secretary 's refusal to process the application was the same as denying it and was thus appropriately subject to judicial review mr goldstein said

 with goodbye hugs and prayers from his supporters msgr russell dillard left his pastoral duties at st augustine 's parish today as the archdiocese announced that he had admitted to inappropriate touching and kissing with two teenage girls 18 years ago as word spread through the parish monsignor dillard a popular leader of the roman catholic parish departed for a residential church center for evaluation he admitted that there was a physical relationship said cardinal theodore e mccarrick leader of the washington archdiocese he does n't characterize it as sexual abuse in an interview with wusa tv monsignor dillard 54 described a father daughter relationship with one of the girls that involved kissing i know that this young woman feels hurt and that i have stepped crossed over a line that though it did not lead to anything that was untoward anything sexual anything like that i have to take responsibility for that he said after announcing the suspension and the notification of the police about the incidents cardinal mccarrick the leader of 600000 church members in washington and southern maryland said my heart and my prayers go out to the people who have come forward i can think of almost nothing more painful than to learn a priest may have violated the trust placed in him in this way church officials said the incidents of sexual misconduct were reported to the archdiocese last week by two women who were not identified they said they were teenagers at the time of the alleged misconduct which occurred from 1979 to 1984 church officials said washington 's mayor anthony a williams a st augustine 's parishioner and friend of the priest described monsignor dillard as a source of strength and inspiration cardinal mccarrick praised the monsignor 's pastoral record but emphasized the need to investigate the incidents fully and to protect children he urged others with such abuse complaints to come forward declaring we want to make sure that we 're taking care of these people the suspension was announced amid growing concern among catholics across the nation about repeated cases of pedophilia and other alleged abuse of parish children that have recently come to light as a problem in various dioceses under the washington archdiocese 's 19 year old policy covering sexual accusations against priests the police were immediately notified officials said district of columbia police officials said the incidents occurred beyond the district 's six year statute of limitations for such crimes
 following syria 's vote for the security council 's resolution demanding new weapons inspections in iraq the arab league voted sunday to urge iraq to comply with the american sponsored resolution on tuesday the six persian gulf arab monarchies in the gulf cooperation council likewise urged iraq to cooperate yesterday iraq indicated that it would comply with the resolution all that arab support for the security council must have hurt saddam hussein for he is the self appointed champion of the arab cause his basic assumption is that there is a single arab nation stretching from the atlantic to the indian ocean at different times history chooses part of this mythical nation to assume leadership in saddam hussein 's view it is now iraq 's turn this dream of power is not only problematic for iraq 's neighbors and fellow arabs it is problematic within iraq as early as 1969 saddam hussein spoke of his determination to strengthen iraq 's uruba arabness this was no easy task although all the people of iraq do feel that they are iraqis not all regard themselves as arabs historically only part of the 7000 year biography of the land that is iraq could be described as arab the rest is covered by sumerian assyrian akkadian babylonian elamite urartan persian byzantine mongol mamluk and ottoman periods among others iraqi architecture music cuisine and daily rituals reflect this rich diversity the word iraq is persian meaning lowlands as is baghdad which means god given the names of iraq 's two great rivers the euphrates and the tigris are greek iraq is also the home of 11 living languages some of which like elamite are twice as old as arabic as much as 25 percent of the population are ethnic kurds speaking two languages surani and bahdinani and following a variety of religions including zoroastrianism then there are assyrians chaldeans armenians nestorians and sabeans most of them christians and turkmen who are muslims arabic is the mother tongue of some 68 percent of the population providing a strong linguistic bond but the ethnic arabs are divided between shiite and sunni muslims saddam hussein does not tolerate hyphenated identities under him no one can be kurdish iraqi or sabean iraqi you have to be arab his problem has been how to arabize iraq in 1970 he opened the ottoman archives in which iraqis were classified as either ottoman or persian subjects he prepared a policy of mass expulsion against the persians even though many prominent iraqis including rashid ali al gailani the father of iraqi nationalism and muhammad al jawahiri the greatest arabic poet of the 20th century had been classified as persian during ottoman rule the mass expulsion of the persians was implemented from 1972 on by 1980 nearly a million people had been driven out needless to say the overwhelming majority of those expelled had been born and raised in iraq regarded themselves as iraqis and spoke arabic as their mother tongue to replace them saddam hussein decided to import a million arabs especially from egypt very soon however he decided that the egyptians were lazy and cared too little about his dreams of empire and conquest in 1980 he decided to arabize the kurds over the next 10 years more than 4000 kurdish villages in the north of the country were razed their inhabitants transferred to southern iraq and scattered among the arabic speaking majority for saddam hussein this was a double coup because the transplanted kurds were sunni while the arabs among whom they would live were shiite a religious group disfavored by mr hussein 's regime under his vision iraq must be fully arabized by force and if necessary through genocide he also wants iraq to secure control of the principal source of arab wealth oil that means either the direct conquest of the persian gulf states or their indirect domination he has shown that he is fully prepared to go to war to fulfill this vision and has done so on four occasions since 1968 his quest for weapons of mass destruction is simply one strategy by which he hopes to dominate the region there are times in history when the leadership of a nation is small saddam hussein said in a speech in 1977 there are other times when the nation is smaller than the leadership a great nation with a small leadership gets nowhere but a great leadership can drag a small nation along to greatness saddam hussein has dragged the people of iraq and to some extent the rest of the arabs into several tragic adventures in the past three decades soon he may drag them into yet another one that may be his last amir taheri is editor of the paris based journal politique internationale

 to the editor your assertion that mayor michael r bloomberg must reopen the fresh kills landfill stinks so to speak editorial march 2 this dump had been the unmitigated bane of staten island for years yet you dismiss its closing as a mere political favor that the reliably republican residents received from former mayor rudolph w giuliani such assertions regularly remind this registered democrat to pull the lever in another column to keep the air and politics clearer if you are true advocates of landfills within the city 's limits how about calling for the draining of the central park reservoir and dumping the city garbage there at least until a cheaper long term solution can be found somehow i imagine that out of state shipping would quickly become a more palatable alternative john v luisi staten island march 2 2002
 it is sometimes said that the sins of the father will be visited upon the son so apparently may the syntax as gov george w bush of texas campaigns furiously through this state in the final days leading up to its caucuses on monday he is amassing examples of twisted verbiage and oratorical bloopers that bring to mind his famously tongue tied father 's forays into linguistic limbo the most memorable one came friday night as he addressed a crowd in council bluffs mr bush was entering the span of his speech in which he normally compares the foreign policy paradigm of yesteryear when the country 's enemy was the soviet union with the situation today when threats are less predictable but he skidded off the rails and into a bog of free floating pronouns and absent antecedents when i was coming up the texas governor said it was a dangerous world and we knew exactly who the they were it was us versus them and it was clear who them was today we 're not so sure who the they are but we know they 're there mr bush also caromed through a standard riff about how well his wife laura reflects on him if people can judge me on the company i keep mr bush said they would judge me with keeping really good company with laura the previous day in pella family values and grammatical ones diverged when mr bush touted parenthood by saying that he and mrs bush understood that their most important job is not to be governor or first lady in my case that followed a fanciful twist to an oft used metaphor about giving people in china a whiff of freedom or letting them breathe freedom in des moines he got carried away with his oxygenated example and described the heady possibilities when you inhale freedom mr bush is also fond of saying that free trade and the internet will let freedom 's genie out of the bottle call it the aladdin doctrine
 ever since jane swift ran for lieutenant governor of massachusetts her life has resembled one of those old airport movies in which there 's a bomb on the plane the stewardess is sucked out the window the captain has a heart attack the little girl on a ventilator starts wheezing and somebody suddenly notices that the flight has wandered into north korean airspace we will skip past ms swift 's successful foray into campaigning while pregnant followed by the deeply unsatisfactory using the staff for baby sitters episode since then she has discovered she is expecting twins while the governor paul cellucci split town to become ambassador to canada ms swift who is rather short on cash and lives a two and a half hour drive from the capital wound up acting governor of the only state in the union that does not provide its executive with an official residence this week when her doctors ordered her to spend the last weeks of her pregnancy in a hospital bed it turned out that ms swift is also running the only state in the union in which the state employees do not get paid unless the governor or lieutenant governor meets every single week with an obscure commission that has the formal power to approve the disbursing of the cash so ms swift who is a republican tried to run the critical meeting via speakerphone but the governor 's council eight democrats who get paid 24000 apiece to approve judicial nominations and shuffle a great deal of paper decided to ask the state supreme court to rule on the legality of the speakerphone gambit this is not a duly constitutional meeting said edward o'brien the most veteran council member who also happens to be the father of the state treasurer this treasurer also happens to be a potential gubernatorial candidate who delivered her first child during a leave of absence from her official duties really this just goes on and on my parents did n't raise me to submarine a female co worker 's career simply because she 's pregnant said mary ellen manning the newest council member it 's a lousy thing to do those of us who do n't live in massachusetts are mainly interested in what lessons we can draw from this drama should ms swift take a leave and let the democratic secretary of state run the show are the democrats picking on a woman while she 's down or at best sitting up in bed i kind of like blaming the governor who fled to canada i do n't think he should have left her in those circumstances said ms manning he should have waited until she delivered a pregnant woman can certainly be governor but i think i speak for us all in suggesting that a semi homeless extremely pregnant woman is not in the perfect position to suddenly take over the job mr cellucci could have timed his departure better he 's going to be ambassador to canada for heaven 's sake our neighbors to the north could have managed on their own until the twins arrived the former governor now in washington where he 's attending ambassador school said the president had wanted him to be in office for last month 's summit of the americas plus i reject the notion that a pregnant woman ca n't be governor he said this is about gender bias somehow i suspect this is about mr cellucci 's desperate desire to get a job that did not involve running for re election as a republican in massachusetts but the current controversy is actually a great political boon for ms swift the state 's mum in chief somehow managed to give birth to her first child and make her way through a challenging second pregnancy without even slightly endearing herself to the people of massachusetts after defending the acting governor this week though ms manning could feel public sentiment turning i went into the diner this morning and everybody said how pretty i looked on tv and that i was absolutely right she added with pleasure i 'm really kind of plain so that was nice of them to say and my phone 's ringing off the hook ms manning a lawyer thinks ms swift would have a great case against the commonwealth if she chose to sue for her rights under the state labor laws i wish i could have given her my card but that would be ambulance chasing she mused

 strange how potent ideas even cheap ones are and stranger still how seldom we encounter them in places like the theater or the novel we 're quite accustomed to their absence in politics when a century changes there is a power struggle between what we know and what we can imagine or just the habit of the familiar versus the ruptures of what has n't been fully or even partly tried subtle or violent we feel this push pull everywhere in politics technology art in all the conventions of caste and class that so shaped who we are or who we no longer wish to be just look back to the playwrights of the early 20th century to shaw and chekhov or to their elders ibsen and strindberg but we need n't look at only the designated greats we need more of the fiercely good less well known minds sensibilities even obsessions take harley granville barker the english playwright director and actor his 1907 play waste just had an an all too brief run in a theater for a new audience production at the american place theater in manhattan the characters in waste live and even die for ideas like church disestablishment and free education for all of britain 's children a woman 's right not to bear children the chasm between private misdeeds and public honor and for the question of whether absolute power corrupts absolutely or can permit compromises that actually benefit the powerless the combination of ideas and passionate theatricalism made waste potent enough to be censored by britain 's lord chamberlain in 1907 and languish unperformed until 1936 the ideas are just as potent now disestablishment some of you might ask it means the withdrawal of state funds from the church of england in our terms the separation of church and state my friends and i admitted we had n't thought of the word since a young black girl spelled antidisestablishmentarianism correctly on a national quiz show in the 1950 's a piece of trivia now but at the time we considered her another welcome proof of the controversial idea that blacks were as smart as whites waste takes us to a country estate where a lady who wants political power must settle for it by maneuvering through her husband where another lady more ambitious than her fiance plots his career behind his back and where a third lady who has left an overbearing husband must protect her reputation as though she were still a virginal maid and it takes us to the london homes where men meet making deals with shrewd anglican priests in high minded language or conducting crude blunt damage control sessions when a sexual liaison an abortion and a death jeopardize the plans of a prime minister and his cabinet what makes a play like this worth seeing is the bond between the past and the way we live or die now here is what happened then waste says here are some of the consequences think about what can and still does happen and it 's not only worth seeing it 's worth reading too playwrights like granville barker like shaw or chekhov strindberg or ibsen read as well as any of their novelist contemporaries they should be read silently or aloud and taught along with them which brings me to a potent and contemporary historical novel published just last year and set like waste in the first years of the century 1901 1909 it is city of light by lauren belfer the city is buffalo perhaps a comedown from london but turn of the century buffalo was a world contender a major force in agriculture and industry grain cattle steel and the country 's most important inland port thanks to the development of hydroelectric power at nearby niagara falls it pioneered the development of electricity and that placed it at the center of the nation 's first major environmental struggle how much water should be diverted from the falls to generate electricity what mattered more a miracle of nature or a miracle of technology and who would profit most from that technology if such a novel were to have a first person narrator a turn of the century writer a frank norris a dreiser an upton sinclair would make that narrator a man but ms belfer gives us louisa barrett headmistress of the intellectually serious socially responsible macaulay school for girls here is how she introduces herself to us to some i am a bluestocking a woman too intellectual to find a husband to others an old maid although i do not consider myself old and i am no maiden to still others i 've flirted with boston marriages i 've lived with other women they say but i never have not that way at least not the way they are implying nonetheless there is a certain benefit in being so considered wives do not fear their husbands spending time with me and overenergetic husbands look elsewhere for their dalliances yes people misjudge me they never guess the truth of my life and their assumptions lend me a freedom they would never credit thus has society given me room to maneuver in secret granted but self knowledge is as the ancient greeks might say the only knowledge worth having this kind of novel is very hard to pull off what 's the point if such books do n't give us something we could n't get from a well written history or from a journal and yet bestowing too much modern acumen on the central figures can be fatal a show off game that you quickly tire of louisa barrett is fascinating company but not because she is a heroine she can be a little pompous ah those ancient greeks her caution gets in the way of her courage and her public rectitude is a constant at times infuriating effort to cover up and make amends for a deeply shameful episode in her past she is a politician in short she negotiates with the millionaires who sit on her school 's board grasping perfectly the commands tucked inside their compliments she admires the the well to do negro couple whose niece attends her school but since their politics anger some of her board members she keeps her distance she does the same with the well born muckraking journalist who wants her help in gathering information about misdeeds among the mighty with whom they both socialize in short she is a politician her loyalties divide and subdivide ms belfer is giving us a mystery how will her shameful past affect her actions will any of buffalo 's mighty fall she is also giving us a social and political drama set in all male clubs and factories in all female schools and settlement houses in stately mansions and asylums for the insane with presidents grover cleveland and william mckinley who was assassinated in buffalo at private standoffs between the ruling protestant and the up and coming irish catholic magnate or on a picket line between unionized east european factory workers and the negro strikebreakers denied union membership city of light and waste move between history and fiction between public events we know about and private events we can only imagine between in short the past we have to live with and the future we can still make for ourselves
 in one of the more brazen strikes at israel 's heart a palestinian man stepped out of a car today and sprayed automatic rifle fire outside the israeli defense ministry here wounding 10 people most of them soldiers on their lunch break the gunman described by a witness as so nonchalant that a cigarette dangled from his lips as he fired was shot in the head and killed by a traffic policeman as he tried to get away the incident came on yet another day of relentless lethal attacks and counterattacks that have made a mockery of a declared cease fire while offering no clear sense of where the long israeli palestinian conflict is headed once again senior figures on each side insisted that they wanted the violence to subside but once again the situation seemed to be steadily deteriorating with each side blaming the other and casting itself as the victim in the west bank tonight palestinians killed an israeli woman tehiya lomberg and wounded four other people as they drove near the settlement of alfe menashe earlier today the israeli army fired missiles at a car in the west bank city of tulkarm killing an islamic militant accused of anti israel terrorism near tulkarm soldiers also shot dead another palestinian said to have been planting a roadside bomb with an accomplice who escaped the missile strike was the third in less than a week part of israel 's pattern of singling out certain palestinians for death to palestinian leaders such attacks amount to a policy of state sponsored assassination but to israelis they are a legitimate form of self defense and they say all their targets including the one today were men who had helped carry out anti israel terrorist attacks or were about to israel 's prime minister ariel sharon made it plain today that he was not about to abandon the tactic i would n't have liked to kill anyone he said in an interview with the fox news channel every casualty is a tragedy but we have to avoid i would say massive tragedies and that 's the only way we can do it to drive home the point that they mean business israeli officials took a new tack tonight announcing on television the names of seven men who are on their wanted list for supposed involvement in terrorism past and present the point was clear they could be next on one level the tel aviv incident was far from the worst given that the only fatality was the gunman himself but the location and the nature of the attack set it apart from most others the defense ministry sits on a major thoroughfare kaplan street it is part of a military compound that also contains the headquarters of the army general staff although the compound is gated its courtyard is exposed to anyone shooting from the street and at noon kaplan street and the surrounding area tend to be filled with young israelis in uniform many of them unarmed on a lunch break from their desk jobs witnesses said the palestinian gunman identified as ali al julani of jerusalem drove up got out of his car and began firing dozens of rounds pvt claire hirschberg said she was walking and talking on a cell phone when she heard the shots i looked straight at him and he looked straight at me and he kept on shooting at me private hirschberg who was slightly wounded later told the israeli radio she continued i did n't get down on the ground because he was also shooting at people on the ground he stood there in complete nonchalance with a cigarette hanging from his mouth shooting at people and looking me straight in the eye the gunman tried to drive off but a few hundred yards away at one of tel aviv 's busiest intersection he was stopped by a traffic policeman who used his patrol car as a roadblock i ordered him to stop and he reached to pull out a gun said the officer ilan zamir i fired one shot in the air i ordered him to stop once again he did n't then i aimed at his head and fired three times struck in the head the gunman managed to drive another 30 yards or so before crashing into a utility pole police officers dragged him out of the car and put him on the ground he died later in a hospital israeli reporters who cover security matters said they had been told by officials that the gunman did not seem to have a history of hard core anti israel militancy it suggested they said that some of the radical palestinian groups have increasingly been forced to send out inexperienced gunmen because the israeli army has thinned their ranks of better trained people asked by a radio reporter if the incident today pointed to a change in palestinian abilities the israeli defense minister binyamin ben eliezer said you and many civilians are unaware of the fact that 85 percent of the terror attacks are being prevented you only hear of a fraction of them when a man or bombs are found the continuing violence has led yasir arafat and his palestinian authority to repeatedly call for a force of international observers to intervene in the conflict but in his television interview mr sharon repeated his opposition saying israel will not accept any international intervention here but the prime minister has also left open the possibility of a strengthened contingent of monitors mostly if not entirely from the united states who would keep track of events without necessarily being on the scene full time

the summer palace is seeing the last of its holiday visitors and all seems right with the world that is china in the northwestern corner of the capital city in a neighborhood that boasts two of china 's top universities beijing and qinghua streets once walked by the greatest intellectuals and revolutionaries in modern chinese history are now home to information technology moguls skyscrapers loom large luxury apartments sell for 2000 a square meter and businessmen send their children to school in well waxed coal black audi a6 's the head of china 's most popular and successful english institute the new oriental school yu minhong can barely keep up with the ranks of students wrangling to secure space in his classes entry into the world trade organization has given china new and much deserved confidence good english skills are the ticket to a prosperous life talent need no longer make its way abroad to find success there is a confidence in individual ability a sense of promise hope and freedom unprecedented in post 1949 chinese life there is much to be thankful for in this new year of the horse there is also much that should not be forgotten as president bush addressed students at qinghua university in beijing on the 30th anniversary of richard m nixon 's momentous trip to china where was the mention of the six qinghua graduate students recently sentenced in southern china 's xiangzhou district court in zhuhai city for utilizing an evil cult to sabotage legal enforcement all are practitioners of falun gong the outlawed meditation movement that numbers its followers in the tens of thousands they had been writing articles about the persecution of falun gong members a confident president jiang zemin claims that these young men and women were arrested for breaking chinese law not for their religious beliefs or for publishing their articles it was a slippery answer to a complex and painful question what exactly does freedom of expression mean as chinese citizens around the country gathered before their tv screens to hear mr bush 's speech we should recall that not far south of the qinghua campus one of china 's most prominent dissidents the literary critic liu xiaobo has been calling for the reform of china 's news media for years now his appeals have not always fallen on deaf ears they brought him three years of re education in a labor camp such a sentence requires no trial one of the many quirks in a legal system responsible for a fifth of the world 's population as liu xiaobo noted in a recent public letter the fact that china can view a press conference or a presidential address on television does not prove that journalism is free and open president jiang 's turns on the dance floor with laura bush and condoleezza rice at thursday evening 's presidential dinner and his stage rocking rendition of o sole mio do not a democratic president make appearances are deceiving president bush 's visit to qinghua came before classes resumed to a campus of closed doors and pulled curtains each audience member each representative student was carefully chosen each question censored a performance orchestrated for an audience whose vision has become blurred by the skyscrapers the sitcoms preaching the power of love and money the european cars the mcdonalds the starbucks the louis vuitton bags and sparkling chanel fragrance counters found in upscale shops around the country the united states is at yet another crossroads in its relationship with china thirty years have passed china is experiencing unprecedented prosperity as the united states struggles through a period of painful contemplation there is much to be remembered more to be learned as globalization brings us closer together and as technology beams the smiling faces of two presidents around the world we should not forget to ask the questions that still need to be asked when will the media in china be privatized when will newspaper editors in china be free to publish articles on topics of their choice when will the ruthless surveillance of writers stop including that of wang yiliang and liao yiwu who have spent years in labor camps and prison cells for daring to write when will china 's people be able to savor and explore the fullest meaning of that phrase freedom of expression a chinese government official claimed before mr bush 's visit that several political prisoners would be released after the visit is this part of the hype that usually surrounds the visits of foreign dignitaries yesterday as the american president 's trip wound down several dozen christians were arrested in beijing for gathering together in public will jailed dissidents like xu wenli the former chairman of the china democratic party who has spent 15 of the last 20 years in jail finally see the light of day we must not become too enthralled with an image of a modern prosperous china americans also must not get lost in the rhetoric of war on terrorism to such a degree that chinese cooperation on that front will blind us to reality for its own sake the united states needs to look more closely at its china policy and at how this policy is being presented by chinese news outlets and viewed by the chinese people in a country without media freedom american democracy and power with some spin can easily be presented as a hateful american hegemony freedom of expression in china is very much in america 's interests in part because without it the government will be able to shape decisively what the chinese people think of the united states on a perfectly beautiful sunny day in september of 2001 the world was reminded of the price paid for freedom who knew the sky was clear the markets were up the subways were packed with commuters on this day of the lunar new year with spring just around the corner beijing 's avenue of heavenly peace throngs with the last of holiday revelers the highways are crowded with evidence of new wealth customers at a starbucks in shanghai pay 3 for a caffe mocha and never feel the sting and there are writers in prison simply because they are writers printing a commentary piece like this could bring a death sentence in china the sun shone as president bush 's motorcade made its way through beijing 's burgeoning streets but looks can be deceiving bei ling a poet and research associate at harvard 's fairbank center for east asian research is director of the independent chinese pen center andrea huss currently in shanghai is a professor of chinese literature at wellesley college

 as the united states tries to assemble an international coalition to respond to the terrorist attacks on new york and washington a number of countries could be ready to listen or alternatively too frightened to because they are already trying to cope with islamic militancy or extremism cloaked in the language of a muslim cause many are local but some guerrilla movements operate across national boundaries russia is the largest and most powerful example for years it has been trying to organize collective action against afghanistan under the taliban calling it a touchstone for rebels in the caucasus and central asia especially in the breakaway chechen republic as the united states seeks russian help it will also try to avoid condoning the serious abuses that russian troops have meted out to citizens of chechnya where last week islamic led separatists were rebuffed after a major assault muslim countries have known the most violence in the name of islam though it would be simplistic to see such rebellions as strictly religious most also have clear political ethnic sectarian or cultural roots pakistan now at the center of american policy is home to militant islamist parties with links to the taliban that could disrupt the weakened economy or bring mobs to the streets neighboring india could use the occasion to crush a rebellion in muslim kashmir that indians blame pakistanis and afghans for fomenting it could also attack pakistan itself islamic militants have long been active in algeria which is now facing a separate rebellion by ethnic berbers a decade ago an islamic front nearly won a national election there before the military stopped the voting which helped prompt a bitter civil war in egypt islamic groups offering education and welfare have won followers among the poor and powerless but they have also killed foreign tourists symbols of the modern secular world that they reject throughout the middle east including in jordan and lebanon groups with islamic names if not causes have been used to pursue neighboring nations foreign policy aims to bolster political factions or undermine the security of local people and outside investors the saudi government came to fear osama bin laden and stripped his citizenship in the hope that he would never return in asia the philippines has struggled for decades to calm an almost solidly muslim south china is actively trying to stamp out moves toward muslim autonomy in its restive western reaches and indonesia the world 's most populous muslim nation faces its oldest separatist movement in the territory of aceh where conservative islam has combined with a fierce nationalism barbara crossette

 to the editor the rap artist chuck d is right to be frustrated by a music industry that is controlled by a dwindling number of corporations op ed april 29 but he is wrong to think of distribution of music on the internet as a new kind of radio or a promotional tool and to suggest that performers give away their work does n't he know that broadcasters rip off performers when their work is played our antiquated copyright law grants royalties for such commercial use only to composers lyricists and publishers instead of finding another way to give away their talents musicians would do better to demand the modernization of copyright law to compensate them whenever their recorded performances generate profits john glasel hoboken nj april 30 2000 the writer was president of local 802 of the american federation of musicians from 1983 to 1992
 mario a paparozzi who served 25 years in the state division of parole has been asked by governor whitman to return to state service as chairman of the beleagured new jersey parole board dr paparozzi replaces andrew b consovoy who left as board chairman in june citing health reasons mr consovoy was under investigation by the state attorney general in connection with allegations of favorable treatment for several inmates with organized crime ties mr consovoy was also under pressure to explain a huge backlog of parole hearing cases which dr paparozzi will move to clear out state inmates filed a class action suit against the board in may claiming lack of action illegally denied inmates the right to fair hearings the attorney general found ealier in the year that the board was operating with a backlog of roughly 4000 cases said pete mcdonough the governor 's director of communications adding that the backlog has been reduced to roughly 1200 cases dr paparozzi who started as a parole officer and left state service in 1998 as head of the divison of parole now teaches criminal justice classes at the college of new jersey a past president of the american probation and parole association dr paparozzi is a board member of the crime victims legal center dr paparozzi is an advocate of the broken windows theory of law enforcement which holds that strict enforcement of minor offenses prevents criminals from committing greater offenses later nationwide states have tightened their parole policies making it much harder for inmates to be released early according to the bureau of criminal justice statistics 27 states have changed their parole systems in the last 15 years and 14 have eliminated early parole the federal prison system requires all inmates to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences in the mid 1990 's the new jersey legislature also required that inmates convicted of serious crimes serve 85 percent of their sentences before they are eligible for release dr paparozzi who once headed the division of parole 's intensive intervention unit said that clearing the parole case backlog did not mean prisoners would be put back on the street my perspective has to do with justice for victims and public safety in the short and long term he said the reponsibility of the board is that everyone gets a hearing on time and the law is followed but not everyone gets paroled
 as i get older i am more and more interested in the bones of a garden the paths and walls the little low hedges of boxwood outlining an herb garden or walkway to a front door i keep looking at the tall red cedar that marks the brow of a field on our land and pondering where i might plant a few cedars of my own a little group of them perhaps by an old foundation that for a few years has cradled my compost pile you should make that your herb garden my friend betty told me the last time she dropped by it 's sunny and protected and it would look beautiful as you walked up from the barn betty is a landscape architect so she sees shapes and forms and connections from one area to another where others see only what is already there so now i watch the sun arcing over this spot noting where the shadows fall trying to gauge if a few red cedars planted on the southwest corner would allow sun loving herbs enough light yes i think so i like the ideas of birds singing from the branches of those cedars and of snow outlining their limbs i am doing the same thing with other parts of the old barn that will soon be my house i may mark a doorway with an alberta spruce picea glauca albertiana because as it grows its rumpled shape and dense little needles take on an almost animistic presence i 'm planting some climbing roses a climbing hydrangea a pyracantha up some of the walls and over certain doorways in winter the climbing hydrangea 's shaggy brown vines will crisscross the concrete walls of the old dairy and its twiggy growth will provide more shelter for the birds inside the old barnyard wall which holds the heat of the winter sun i want to plant a japanese apricot prunus mume whose fragrant winter flowers open as early as february or march while many trees and shrubs including roses do well planted in the fall fruit trees fare better planted in early spring this is the time to order them while there are plenty in stock to be delivered in early march i find myself poring over books like rosemary verey 's garden in winter timber press 1995 where cotoneaster horizontalis pictured covered with red berries is clipped to frame a doorway and the windows of a house that sits right on the street two clipped box honeysuckles lonicera nitida flank the same front door acting as a kind of soft green ballast to the crimson berries which offer a warm welcome to passers by i have ordered a few witch hazels like hamamelis mollis the chinese witch hazel which will bloom in february on a mild day if i plant it in full sun and put it close to the house where its fragrance can waft in the window mollis is a striking species with open arching branches as it matures h mollis pallida is a hybrid with larger more fragrant yellow flowers that dangle from the bare branches jelena is another fragrant witch hazel with coppery twisted petals that can add a touch of warm fire to the winter garden winter yellow jasmine jasminum nudiflorum has very early flowers and though they are n't fragrant their appearance in mid winter signals the coming of spring do n't forget to plant a few thousand more little bulbs under these shrubs and evergreens a sea of pale pink crocus tomasinianus looks glorious under the dark trunk of a beech tree or in a small garden under the contorted branches of harry lauder 's walking stick corylus avellana contorta which blooms by the way in late february or march so as you are cleaning up the garden this fall think in pictures i am thinking of putting a few willows salix alba britzensis in a low lying little swale that catches the rain and stays wetter than most parts of my yard the curving young stems of this variety are golden with amber centers and if you cut the shrub back each spring after its catkins bloom the shoots will grow all summer and fall and by winter glow in the sun the winterberries are another old standby essential for the birds since the bright red fruits cling to branches long into winter i 'm going to plant two together this year ilex verticillata winter gold which has salmon orange berries alongside winter red which has crimson fruit evergreens shrubs and hardwoods will thank you for a fall planting their roots still have time to get established before the hard freeze make sure you dig an adequate hole with well draining soil and water regularly if it does n't rain two mail order sources for a wide variety of plants are heronswood nursery 7530 288th street ne kingston wash 98346 360 297 4172 catalog 5 wwwheronswoodcom and forest farm 990 tetherow road williams ore 97544 541 846 7269 catalog 5 www forestfarmcom

 a turkish man and his american fiancee were arrested thursday night with explosive chemicals and five pipe bombs in their apartment and they were held on charges of planning a terrorist attack on a major american military base in heidelberg on or near sept 11 german authorities announced tonight the man 25 had a picture of osama bin laden in the apartment near heidelberg along with islamic literature and a book about building bombs said thomas schauble the chief prosecutor for the state of baden wurttemberg the arrested woman a 23 year old who held joint german and american citizenship worked at a supermarket for american military personnel and dependents at the military base in heidelberg the prosecutor said we suspect that they intended to mount a bomb attack against military installations and the city of heidelberg mr schauble said at an evening news conference in the state capital stuttgart we have evidence that an attack was planned for sept 11 the anniversary of the attacks in the united states but there was no information released tonight that indicated whether the couple were in communication with the qaeda network or any other qaeda cell like the one in hamburg that carried out the sept 11 attacks heidelberg is the headquarters for the united states army in europe and for the army 's v corps about 16000 american military personnel their families and civilian employees live and work in the area a significant portion of the roughly 62000 american soldiers based in europe said col carl kropf chief spokesman for the united states army forces europe base employees like the woman arrested have special passes and can normally enter base facilities without extensive searches the plot if the allegations are proved would be one of the most serious efforts to attack american targets since the events of sept 11 the names of the two suspects were not released mr schauble said the man was a strict muslim who seems to be a follower of osama bin laden who is deeply religious and harbors a hatred for americans and jews the woman had also shown a hatred of jews mr schauble said the two were arrested at their apartment in walldorf the apartment contained 287 pounds of what were described as explosive chemicals and five pipe bombs mr schauble said that american investigators produced information that led to the arrest of the couple but colonel kropf and other american officials reached in germany tonight refused to comment further on the case saying that the suspects are under german jurisdiction german federal authorities working for the federal prosecutor kay nehm said tonight that they would not comment on the case which is being handled by the state authorities but they said they were following the investigation all american installations in germany have been on a high state of alert for some time senior european officials say they expect al qaeda to be planning new attacks on americans and american targets whether in the united states or around the world as the anniversary of the sept 11 attacks approaches they say they also expect qaeda sympathizers and cells cut off from central authority with osama bin laden and some of his leading lieutenants missing to try to operate on their own intelligence officials say american sites abroad are likely to be easier targets than those in the united states in what appeared to be an arrest not related to the explosives case an afghan born german citizen from hamburg was taken into custody in new york and is now being held in alexandria va the german federal prosecutor 's office announced today it said that the man 39 left germany for the united states in mid july and was arrested in mid august american officials told the germans that there was evidence that the man who was not publicly identified was planning terrorist attacks the german authorities said they began an investigation of the man on aug 20 on possible charges of membership in a terrorist organization earlier this week ulrich kersten chief of germany 's federal investigative agency said officials were sure that in europe and in germany there are people who are ready to commit violence in a jihad he said he could not rule out the existence of other qaeda cells in germany and elsewhere german authorities have opened investigations into at least 100 islamic militants who live in germany and who are suspected of having fought in afghanistan chechnya or bosnia or having been trained in terrorist camps in afghanistan some of the investigations are of turkish groups that want to overthrow the secular turkish government and that have no apparent connection to al qaeda but investigators worry that al qaeda is infiltrating or using other groups or that other groups are putting their assets and networks at its service germany has passed new laws to undercut some of its traditional protection of privacy to improve its ability to combat terrorist groups and sleeper cells who often used mosques as cover new laws allow the authorities to go after the finances of groups bent on terrorist attacks to prosecute hate speech even if it takes place in a mosque and to

 so will the president focus more on wall street 's lipstick index or teddy roosevelt 's big stick index the lipstick index is a way to judge a recession when the economy goes down lipstick sales go up women indulge in smaller luxuries and skip bigger ones the big stick index is a way conservatives judge the president will w whack saddam with the stick or will he fold the way his dad did mr bush spent his first year using his father 's failures as a reverse playbook trying to dodge 41 's mistakes 43 catered to congressional right wingers and muscled through a mammoth tax cut when the economy slumped he took great pains to tell americans he understood their pain so he would not seem oblivious and wrapped up in foreign affairs like his father then sept 11 hit and he had to get wrapped up in foreign affairs if the president uses the reverse playbook now and continues to coddle the conservatives his father neglected he has to go topple the wacky iraqi completing poppy 's unfinished business but if he does that he turns his attention away from the recession repeating poppy 's mistake after his war when he never used his celestial approval ratings to fix the economy it 's a surreal oedipal loop de loop made all the loopier by the spectacle of history repeating itself and putting the son at the same juncture where his father made two of the most critical and criticized decisions of his presidency because 41 detached from baghdad and detached from economic angst at home 43 is under extra pressure to attack iraq while attacking the recession the man who started out as the most disengaged president in modern history is now being pestered by his aides and his conservative base to engage engage engage his political and military advisers are competing for his attention as he decides how hotly to pursue the war at a time when the economy is foundering and deficits are back it is a measure of how nervous the white house is given republican losses in the recent gubernatorial elections that it dumped gov james gilmore of virginia as party chief last week should the president rout osama and the taliban and then focus like a laser beam on this economy as bill clinton said when he beat bush senior or should he go on to phase two as the get saddam crowd calls it now that the us is on a roll as state department official richard armitage puts it at the moment mr bush is juggling furiously in his saturday radio address the president concentrated on the recession and expressed concern about soaring unemployment it 's a time to reach out to americans who are hurting he said to help them put food on the table and to keep a roof over their heads and if mr bush has not yet decided whether to crack saddam with the big stick he has been talking more loudly anyway he said if iraq did not allow un inspectors into the country to check for weapons of mass destruction it would find out the consequences it 's hard to say if the swagger was meant to co opt the string of perles richard perle and others who are in full cry to crush saddam or to lay a real groundwork for at least bombing iraq it is curious that the president tolerates such open provocation from people in his administration and connected to it given that the clamor sets him up to look soft on saddam if he does n't go after iraq paul wolfowitz the no 2 pentagon official has been the spark plug of the get saddam club other drum beaters are mr perle on a pentagon advisory board and fellow board member james woolsey who went on a government plane with a team from justice and defense to investigate whether iraq was involved in the 9 11 attacks if we can not drive this tyrant from office mr perle said on cnn then we ca n't do anything in an interview with bob novak and al hunt on cnn saturday donald rumsfeld was asked about mr perle 's agitations look richard perle is richard perle he replied praising mr perle but adding he does not speak for the president he does not speak for me so many voices so little time it 's enough to send a president burrowing back into his feather pillow
 to the editor re on the road again editorial aug 14 the problem is not merely the republicans redistricting gambits in texas that is only one part of the very troubling big picture the right 's attempt to usurp power at every level first there was the impeachment of president bill clinton whose two legitimate election victories were never seen as such by the conservatives that was followed by the republicans controversial victory in the 2000 elections now they are trying to gerrymander texas so that they can keep a stronghold and they 're leading the effort to recall the twice elected democratic governor of california it 's clear that the republicans have a calculated plan to seize power by any means they regard the electorate with such disdain and contempt that it is astonishing that there is n't more outrage at their autocratic rule ranjana murthy redwood city calif aug 15 2003
 to the editor thomas l friedman column oct 26 says that in the arab world the middle east war of 1973 is referred to as the ramadan war he cites this as proof that the arabs have no reluctance to engage in warfare during their holy month despite their protestations to the contrary it certainly bears mentioning that in the jewish world that same war is referred to as the yom kippur war because it was begun by the arabs on yom kippur the most sacred day of the jewish year the arab world also had no qualms about desecrating the sacred times of other faiths rabbi gerald c skolnik forest hills queens oct 26 2001
 to the editor in the damaged spirit of the sept 11 fund op ed jan 18 fred price and mitch kleinman argue that the rules of the federal victims compensation fund are flawed they are right but their solution pushes the balance of compensation further in the wrong direction they advocate compensation based on potential lifetime earnings meaning that a 25 year old stockbroker with an ivy league degree would receive far more compensation than a 50 year old janitor but this does not compensate families for their actual losses but rather rewards those who happened to be young members of a who 's who of the financial sector it also tends to reward those who had the financial resources to get advanced degrees a group that will not be reflective of the racial and ethnic backgrounds of the victims as a whole in life stockbrokers and lawyers may have been worth more financially than janitors and secretaries but in death we are all equal the fairest way to distribute the compensation fund is to recognize that equality and begin compensation from a baseline of an equal division jason gottlieb new york jan 18 2002
 for years suffolk county law enforcement authorities have been concerned that street gangs of the sort seen in the five western towns and nassau would some day spread to the east end now east end police officials and community leaders say there is mounting evidence that that time has come officials in southold town the most rural of long island 's 13 townships reported that during the past month they had charged several local men with crimes ranging from burglary to dwi all of whom admitted being or were identified as members of the salvadoran gang mara salvatrucha or ms 13 detective sgt john sinning of the southold town police said people wearing tattoos of the bloods another national street gang had also been seen in the town the riverhead police said they arrested and charged a group of young women with gang assault after an incident at riverhead high school late last year the rev marvin dozier who is leader of the southampton youth association and also has ministries at the unity baptist church in mattituck and the suffolk county jails said there had been repeated outbreaks of low level gang violence in southampton and bridgehampton mr dozier said he is seeing some gang movement on both forks particularly in greenport mattituck and cutchogue on the north fork and sections of bridgehampton and southampton on the south fork it is mostly neighborhood stuff he said they are cliques but there has been some effort to join some of the national groups the suffolk district attorney thomas j spota said that the east end gang activity included groups that are organized that engage in street crime and violence and have the paramilitary structure used by street gangs but that there is scant evidence of east end gangs having formal affiliations with the latin kings ms 13 the bloods the crips legion of doom and other national gangs that have established footholds up island hector lasalle a suffolk assistant district attorney warned however that the national gangs see suffolk county as fertile ground the first major action to curb gang activity in suffolk came soon after mr spota took office in january 2002 within weeks he established an anti gang task force that included agents from federal state and county law enforcement agencies the suffolk police commissioner john gallagher assigned 150 officers to the task force mr spota also increased the number of assistant district attorneys assigned to gang prosecutions to eight from one most work on up island problems but one anthony palumbo is specifically assigned to the five east end towns in the last year representatives from most of the east end police departments have participated in countywide gang awareness roundtables put on by the suffolk police department 's gang intelligence unit east hampton school officials said they are working with town police to prevent gang activity we are on the lookout for colors jewelry and so forth said leon parks assistant principal of east hampton high school capt richard smith of the riverhead police department said it was running informational seminars for parents and teachers and gathering intelligence on known gang members living in the area a riverhead high school senior who asked that he not be identified said some kids are running around the school doing the bloods symbol with their hands last fall there was one day where there were eight or nine fights in the high school between two groups of kids and the police had to be called in it was crazy fights were breaking out in the halls in between every period teachers had to escort us to our classrooms detective evelyn hobson of the riverhead police said the fights in the school were prompted by a dispute between two local gangs the doctor 's path flames and flanders finest later she said another round of fighting broke out between female members of both gangs five juveniles and one adult were arrested the girls who ranged in age from 14 to 16 were charged with gang assault donna lyczkowski is a youth counselor for the town of riverhead juvenile aid bureau they may not be the gangs as you know them in the big cities she said of the local groups but they are acting as gangs most riverhead parents do n't see the wannabe gangs as real problems ms lyczcowski said but when you look at how far east the serious gangs are it 's clear that if you do n't take a positive step toward preventing it it is going to be here one reason county officials are concerned about riverhead is that at any given time there are 200 inmates whom law enforcement has identified as gang members being held at the county jail which is in nearby riverside some of the gang members who are released from the county facility have relocated to riverhead and other east end towns according to police intelligence officials mr dozier said he has also observed increased gang activity at the correctional facility in riverhead sometimes our services are used for meeting places he said explaining that he has seen inmates flashing gang signals and signs during sermons the police in the town of southold said they too have become aware of a local street gang operating in their jurisdiction sergeant sinning said his officers are currently monitoring a gang of 12 to 15 individuals mainly greenport who are calling themselves the murder unit we have one group of individuals who fit the criteria or definition of a street gang he said they are organized and they are committing crimes we have recovered weapons guns he said its members are whites hispanics and african americans between the ages of 14 and 25 on the south fork mr dozier said he is seeing groups of youths in southampton and bridgehampton that are involved in drug trafficking and other low level crimes this is not a large group of the kids but there are always one or two trafficking drugs he said one rips off the next one and then everyone gets upset over the deal and it starts mr dozier said the youths sort of form packs for mutual protection each pack begins to protect their own turf he added repeated calls to the southampton town and southampton village police departments were not returned mr parks the assistant principal from east hampton said school officials have seen some gang graffiti but no further evidence of organized gangs the east hampton village police chief gerard larsen jr said sure there are wannabe gang members but we have n't seen any organized activities but detective john o'lever who heads suffolk 's gang intelligence unit made no such distinction geographically the east end towns are starting to see gang activity he said they have graffiti which is an indicator of gang activity they did n't have it a few years back
 traveling with george w bush 's 2000 campaign alexandra pelosi kept her video camera running and came up with this startling revelation about the man who would be president sometimes he talks with his mouth full really full of cheese and crackers that was no mere slip he is also caught talking with a mouthful of what appears to be a sandwich fortunately for mr bush the democrats never attacked him on the gross table manners issue there 's a lot about food in journeys with george an amusing breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail made when ms pelosi was an nbc news producer it 's a witty reminder that campaigns are an endless string of foolish events and photo ops that are wildly detached from the hard issues a president has to deal with there 's mr bush driving a snowmobile in new hampshire proving what that he can make a quick getaway if ufo 's land in the rose garden during a blizzard we knew that about campaigns but the documentary reinforces the idea with wonderful timing it will be shown tonight on hbo arriving on an election day fraught with issues like terrorism and a floundering economy halfway through mr bush 's term journeys with george is like a time capsule taking us back to 1999 when mr bush was trying to overcome his frat boy image much of the documentary was shot on the press plane where reporters campaign staffers and the candidate himself all pretend to let their hair down and act as if they 're not on opposite sides of a public relations war mr bush makes funny faces as he plays to the camera he teases ms pelosi about her love life charms her and treats her as comic relief stop filming me you 're like a head cold he says with a warm smile it 's a thoroughly disarming tactic after one particularly mangled speech he gets on the plane 's public address system and makes fun of his own grammatical flubs he is the living image of the guy for whom his campaign mass produces homemade looking signs that read love ya dubya but this likable guy is rarely asked to talk about issues instead ms pelosi interviews her acerbic colleagues about their insular repetitive lives as they all traipse from one orchestrated event to another at 90 minutes the film is about a half hour too long but it backs up what a reporter for the financial times of london tells her about the process of campaigning for the most powerful job in the world most of our time is spent doing really stupid things in stupid places with stupid people ms pelosi is upfront about her own politics narrating in a raspy singsong voice that reinforces the sense of watching a home movie she says early on that her mother is representative nancy pelosi a democrat from california and the house minority whip and she has said that viewers will impose their own political slants on the film bush supporters will find the portrait humanizing while the anti bush contingent will see a bobble headed bush doll but she skirts political issues so widely that even that seems unlikely when she promoted the show on late night last week conan o'brien watched a scene of mr bush munching cheetos and joked i like him better already you can only find political links by stretching a point here and there when ms pelosi pulls out her absentee ballot and asks mr bush why she should vote for him he sits in the seat next to her joking and giving her campaign platitudes more tellingly he takes the ballot from her hand and says how does it work for starters and it was n't even from florida it was a california ballot and behind mr bush 's back she votes for bill bradley near the end of the campaign ms pelosi takes a straw poll among the margarita fueled reporters on the plane who predict al gore will win when that tidbit turns up in a gossip column the other reporters stop talking to her mr bush saves her by walking up putting a friendly arm around her shoulder and quietly offering some advice she says that he told her when they see me talking to you they 're going to act like your friends again but those people are n't your friends they can say what they want about me but at least i know who i am and who my friends are it 's a lesson he obviously learned at his father 's knee and that ms pelosi says she learned at that moment with its suggestion that every second of his supposedly candid behavior was cautious after all that may be the most honest and revealing comment in the film either that or mr bush 's flat out statement i like a good baloney sandwich journeys with george hbo tonight at 9 30 eastern and pacific times 8 30 central time written directed and produced by alexandra pelosi co directed and edited by aaron lubarsky julie anderson supervising producer for hbo sheila nevins executive producer for hbo

 there is both a place and a need for children 's works in the classical music repertory but few composers have turned their hand to the task and of those that have few have done it successfully success of course is in the ear of the beholder but one criterion is that the work can sit comfortably beside the concert works in the composer 's catalog as prokofiev 's peter and the wolf saint saens 's carnival of the animals britten 's young people 's guide to the orchestra and poulenc 's histoire de babar do it must also accomplish several seemingly irreconcilable tasks it must be sufficiently entertaining to engage young minds that are likely to wander if the piece evolves too slowly it must offer a lesson of some sort even if it 's only a sense of what orchestral instruments sound like and what kinds of imagery they can evoke but at the same time it must avoid seeming didactic probably the biggest challenge though is in writing a work that adults can listen to without squirming raphael mostel 's travels of babar based on the second jean de brunhoff 's babar book meets these disparate demands nicely judging from children 's reactions on sunday afternoon at florence gould hall where the work had its new york premiere run babar remains a children 's favorite and mr mostel capitalized on that by making sure that the story was seen as well as heard pictures from the book were projected on a screen behind the musicians mr mostel 's music is direct picturesque and rather sweet when babar and his bride celeste fly off on their honeymoon in a balloon a gently rising figure for viola cello piano and lightly rippling percussion lifts them on their way in the hour that follows their adventures narrated here by eli wallach and anne jackson in an english translation by phyllis rose are accompanied by elephant trumpeting car horns in the travel music quickly passing dissonances in the battle with the rhinoceroses and bird calls in the evocation of the elephant kingdom the characters are not given instrumental equivalents but each of the instruments in the octet that accompanies the reading has opportunities to show off and to push the edges of their techniques there are also references in the score for adults including a fragment of a bach cello prelude some stravinskian cornet music in a circus scene and a touch of slightly controlled chaos in the spirit of john cage perhaps most crucially the music has a narrative and lyrical flow that makes its charms hard to resist the travels of babar does sit oddly beside the works for which mr mostel is known principally he has been an explorer in timbre texture and acoustics and has created a repertory of entrancing works using ancient instruments principally shofars and tibetan singing bowls still this work which has occupied mr mostel for the last nine years seems an expansion into another musical realm rather than an abberation the fine musicians in the octet were david hattner clarinetist martin kuuskman bassoonist tom hoyt cornetist michael hosford trombonist joseph kubera pianist eduardo leandro percussionist aurora manuel violist and dorothy lawson cellist paul hostetter conducted

 teams of american investigators searching in iraq have recovered more than 700 artifacts and tens of thousands of ancient manuscripts that had been missing from the collection of the national museum in baghdad some of them stored in underground vaults before the american invasion american officials said today the investigators located the vaults in baghdad over the last week including five within the museum complex and forced them open revealing hundreds of artifacts that had apparently been stored away to protect them from being damaged in an american assault the finds included ancient jewelry pottery and sarcophaguses officials said the discovery of so many valuable artifacts would support the view of iraqi museum officials and american investigators who have said that while many irreplaceable antiquities were looted from the museum during the fall of baghdad last month the losses were less severe than thought earlier this week a top official of the british museum john e curtis disclosed that his iraqi counterparts had told him that they had largely emptied display cases at the iraq museum in the months before the start of the iraq war storing many of the most precious artifacts in secure hiding places the teams of investigators united states customs agents working with american soldiers did not provide a detailed inventory of the items that were found in the underground vaults this week nor would they say if the artifacts included any of the 38 high value items that had been confirmed missing by museum administrators but they did offer a partial list of the items recovered by american investigators before the vaults were forced opened this week including a vase reported to date from the fifth century bc and a broken statue of an assyrian king from around 900 bc both were handed over to american forces by iraqi citizens in the last month the united states has offered amnesty to iraqis who turn in looted objects from the museum and other archaeological collections the officials offered few details today on the 39400 ancient manuscripts from the museum collection that were also reported found officials said that the american investigators had been uncovering the artifacts and manuscripts so quickly in recent days that there had been no time to try to determine exactly what much of the material was or its value the recovery of these items was the direct result of a superb cooperative effort between us law enforcement the us military and the iraqi people said michael j garcia acting assistant secretary of the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement an investigative arm of the department of homeland security the department said in a statement that investigators had found evidence in some of the vaults that certain select high value pieces had been stolen from the storage sites officials said that an iraqi museum curator who was taken to one of the vaults in baghdad in recent days had fainted on discovering that some of the most valuable items stored there before the war had vanished apparently stolen by someone with access to the vault american officials said the new homeland security department which took control of the customs service earlier this year dispatched several agents to the middle east in the weeks before the american invasion of iraq in the hope that their expertise would be valuable in searching for iraq 's chemical and biological weapons and in tracking down assets of saddam hussein and his family and associates after the first reports of looting at the museum long recognized as possessing one of the middle east 's largest and most valuable archaeological collections the customs agents shifted their focus to the hunt for those artifacts american investigators have complained that their work has been hindered by a lack of cooperation from museum workers who have so far been unable to provide a full inventory of the museum 's collection and by uncertainty over how many objects were on open display when the looting began american officials say there is a growing suspicion that insiders within the museum 's administration were to blame for much of the thefts the homeland security department said that its teams in iraq had recently identified other storage areas in the vicinity of baghdad that are believed to contain artifacts from the museum officials said the investigators are following up on reports that many artifacts are stored in several vaults beneath the headquarters of the iraqi central bank in baghdad in his comments earlier this week in new york mr curtis the british museum official who is the curator of its near east collection said it appeared that the vast majority of the looting at the national museum in baghdad had not taken place in its display halls but rather in its basement storage rooms where more commonplace objects were kept

 day after day after day i stand staring at the posters for the missing i see them all over town but only in my own neighborhood do i stand and stare every day in front of the hospital the supermarket the bus shelter by now they are my intimates when i do n't know what to do with myself and that 's quite often these days they are the company i seek out late last week i looked around and saw that i was not alone in this practice day after day the same faces had been gathered around the posters at the same odd hours as me 4 in the afternoon midnight as though these people too when they did n't know what to do with themselves sought the same company what is this i thought why do we keep coming back only now do i think i can answer this question at 9 30 am on sept 11 i stood across the street from my house on the corner of 12th street and seventh avenue in a silent crowd watching the world trade center burn within minutes the neighborhood was a war zone sirens screaming down the avenue st vincent 's hospital wheeling a row of beds onto the pavement people lining up to give blood and it remained one for a week avenues closed to traffic except for police cars and ambulances television trucks parked outside emergency admitting klieg lights on day and night and most dreamlike the need to show id if you wanted to get back home from a trip above 14th street it felt as though we had been quarantined it still feels that way and i like it i like feeling quarantined down here in the village the world has become a painful abstraction only the streets that i know seem to give comfort it was in this mood that the posters plastered over hospital walls on every lamppost and bus shelter across the plate glass windows of the food emporium began to acquire power over me at first i looked upon them only as a horrifying record of the unimaginable loss of life we have sustained uniform in meaning then i began to see them differently it was the details that were making them remarkable often a poster presents itself simply just a photo and vital statistics but even more often the description begins to fill itself in in the oddest of ways we learn of dyed yellow hair a dropped right eyelid two fingers missing a badly knit appendix scar john doherty gray hair glasses sober black suit has a strawberry birthmark on his back eric bennett wide grin on his face deep stretch marks in both armpits chunky ruben esquilin is hemophiliac then there are the clothes bob levinson 102nd floor tower 1 was wearing black slacks and a blue striped shirt he usually wears sunglasses but on the 11th he left them home and the jewelry an enamel necklace with a religious photo a wedding band of brushed gold with four to six channel set diamonds and the tattoos casey cho has a dragon down the middle of her back with a chinese character in red eric bennett a bulldog on his right shoulder michelle reed a spider web on her right big toe in a change of pace i am told only that handsome fitzroy st rose is missing from the 83rd floor please call six 718 numbers are listed or i am being asked have you seen joseph roberto 85th floor tower 2 not another word only the photograph of a face of startling kindness looking directly at me these are the details that compel my attention but what holds it day after day poster after poster are the revisions always in parentheses penciled or inked in like the news about eric bennett 's deep stretch marks or the observation that jim oakley 's tattoos are poorly done as for nancy ngo we are told she is wearing a jade necklace and a wedding ring with nick on the inside then in parenthesis is added diamond stud earrings the poster that drives all this home is for colleen supinski 27 last seen on the 104th floor of tower 2 she has we are told by her relative noreen supinski whom we are to call large blue eyes long thick eyelashes long blond hair tiny wrists and fingers small frame petite features small gap

the day of noreen reviewing her composition extraordinary enough with its long thick eyelashes and tiny wrists nodding walking away and then like any writer driven to self correction coming back no

 parents who smoke may be encouraging their children to try smoking by asking them to do things like lighting their cigarettes or cleaning out their ashtrays researchers reported yesterday a study that looked at the children for a year concluded that they were at a minimum more likely to experiment with tobacco the lead author dr rafael laniado laborin told a conference of american college of chest physicians in san diego the researchers surveyed 3624 seventh and eighth graders in san diego asking them about their smoking patterns if any and whether their parents engaged in what the study refers to as smoking prompts these include having the children light the cigarettes for the parents sometimes in a child 's mouth take cigarettes to the parents or go to the store and buy them the study then focused on 292 parents who smoked and their children when the children were interviewed a year later those whose parents gave them prompts were more likely to have tried cigarettes dr laniado laborin said the study also found that many parents were not aware of what they were doing when asked for example whether they had their children bring them cigarettes 25 percent said yes but when their children answered the question the figure was 59 percent just under 9 percent of the parents said their children cleaned their ashtrays almost half the children said they did so children whose parents smoke are already known to be more likely to try smoking when children have easy access to cigarettes the risk increases dr laniado laborin said
 they had a practice session once when they were kids that began at 8 o'clock in the morning and lasted until 3 in the afternoon venus and serena williams battled each other for what amounted to a school day because as venus said when you 're little you just keep hitting and hitting when you get older the time 's less and less at the ripe old age of 21 venus williams and 19 year old serena kept another 8 o'clock date to hit last night the prime time realization of a family 's and television network 's improbable dream the storybook ending to the united states open two african american sisters from the inner city in a stadium named for arthur ashe all they were being asked to do finally and forever was live up to the moment rise above the emotion of a life together a bedroom shared complementary games unlike the contrasting styles of agassi and sampras or martina and chris but after all the sisterly psychology the indisputable reality was that venus williams is the best player of her country the world and her family as well a match that was preceded by diana ross singing god bless america and a fireworks show befitting the fourth of july was played far above prior suspicions of match fixing and in flashes beyond qualitative levels of their previous play venus williams who defended her title in a 6 2 6 4 victory is just too consistent and confident at this point for not so little sis while serena sprayed 36 unforced errors venus was patient and grounded a martina hingis with six extra inches and a steady 115 plus mile an hour serve i love you she said hugging serena at the net and what else was there to say except congratulations to both the sisters came to new york and handled the questions about them the way they dealt with opponents with grace and guile consistently returning for flat out winners they avoided the baits the traps the pervasive undercurrent of race criticized in the past for not being gracious they went out of their way to credit the vanquished serena warmly received lindsay davenport after their quarterfinal match just two months after davenport ridiculed her at wimbledon as a chronic excuse maker venus was complimentary of jennifer capriati after their semifinal friday even though capriati known for rushing on her own serve became upset at venus for doing likewise staring her down capriati barely made eye contact while shaking hands for the most part they have conducted themselves with admirable restraint ignoring or disavowing their father 's more grandiose pronouncements it 's bad enough that the sisters have been held accountable for their father 's behavior it 's worse that the williamses refined and reasoned mother oracene is typically a family afterthought for a news media as quick to denounce richard williams as it is to provide him a forum if the father constructed his daughter 's backhands it is clear that oracene williams has been the architect of their public comportment which has been scrutinized like no other player 's and especially for the sensational occurrences of williams versus williams a lot of the matches we played have n't been considered championship heroic matches venus said the least of which was the semifinal at indian wells last spring that venus did n't play defaulting minutes before they were due on court she could have handled it better and i 'd wager will from here on out we should also remember that other brother and sister acts that have been described as unpleasant to torturous by the various participants in more than 20 professional matches among the three maleeva sisters the older sister won all but one an injury default self imposed pressure is what it is but the others from the maleevas to the mcenroes played nowhere near a grand slam final in their home country a milestone occasion created with this very match in mind we definitely could have a rivalry serena said saying she was at least past the feeling of sisterly dread we could really get the sparks going there was some tension in the second set as serena tried to slug her way into the match encouraged by a celebrity studded crowd hoping an event might yet be an epic venus with a borg like stoicism masking the discomfort of having to humble serena on the most celebrated night of their tennis lives was not more powerful just too good i think venus has actually taken power off her ball using tactics to make less mistakes serena would say calling the night windy and weird serena flailed in a stiff breeze venus figured out how to play through it it is no mystery why she has won four of the last six slams her toughest lesson was learned on the day she watched serena win the first family slam here two years ago venus said she took something from watching serena that night how to be a competitor it was serena 's turn last night to prove she could play at venus 's ascendant level that she could n't probably has less to do with the complexities of sisterhood of being 17 months apart and entered into the same race and more to do with the best player in the world playing another from the rest of a very good pack nothing to question there nothing to apologize for two sisters beat incredible odds just getting to this night to prime time for that they deserve universal praise and respect
 on the surface it looked like big news the russian news service interfax quoted prime minister mikhail kasyanov today as saying that a group of russian oil companies might agree next week to reduce oil exports in support of the efforts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries to raise oil prices western news agencies picked up the report and traders started bidding crude prices up sharply at one point they had risen 6 percent the biggest move in more than a year but they closed at a 5 percent rise at 2222 a barrel up 105 there was however less to the development than met the eye in the original russian the prime minister 's language was much more equivocal than the news headlines suggested and industry analysts and some of the oil companies themselves said an agreement to cut exports was very unlikely russia has been the fastest growing oil producer among non opec countries this year its rising exports have complicated opec 's attempts to restrict global supply and prop up prices a task that has become more difficult since the attacks on the united states on sept 11 crude prices have fallen by more than one third since then seeking closer cooperation the saudi arabian oil minister ali al naimi is scheduled to visit moscow on sunday in advance of an opec meeting next week speaking on condition that they not be named executives at several of the biggest russian oil companies said in separate interviews that they had no plans to cut production and had not agreed to join a cartel within russia to limit exports means limiting production and no one will go for that now one oil company representative said referring to the prime minister 's remarks he said this looks like a good will gesture for opec dmitry avdeev oil analyst at the united financial group an investment bank in moscow said there are a lot of questions about how this would actually work the government does n't have any real ways of forcing private companies to cut russia 's oil industry cash rich from high oil prices and a currency devaluation that slashed production costs has been stepping up output and greater production is already built into their strategies and forecasts for next year for example sibneft russia 's sixth largest producer plans to pump about one third more oil in 2002 than in 2001 mr avdeev estimated that oil exports from russia would rise 7 percent to 8 percent next year crude oil exports from russia and the countries of the former soviet union account for about one tenth of world exports
 to the editor re why chain stores are n't the big bad wolf on the contrary june 3 in which daniel akst justified shopping at big discount stores by saying they help the working poor by offering jobs and low prices large chain stores with their high staff turnover can never provide the service of small local specialty stores although mr akst says local stores never lived up to their image instead providing a unique combination of high prices and poor service sustained only by the local monopolies they enjoyed before the advent of the chains i dare say that anyone who has ever looked for help in a large chain store or a big box bookstore will take exception mr akst also says chain stores force other stores to lower their prices too implying more competition but smaller stores which buy products in dozens ca n't possibly compete with chains which buy by the containerload and the column ignores the role that small neighborhood stores fill for older shoppers who using public transportation or traveling on foot are not likely to be impressed by acres of parking spaces at the mall small businesses are and always have been the lifeblood of their communities they support the little league teams the school plays the junior league fund raisers and so on service convenience product knowledge special ordering knowing their customers and their families by name remembering their sizes if mr akst can find all that in a chain store then by all means that 's where he should shop my guess is that he wo n't find it eric nussbaum scarsdale ny june 4

 when president thabo mbeki of south africa said last year that azt was too dangerous to give to hiv infected pregnant women aids researchers and activists were taken aback the drug is commonly used to prevent transmission of the disease to newborns and many of the people who advocate its use said thousands of lives would be lost in a country where the epidemic is burning at white heat that reaction turned to shock when mr mbeki appointed an aids advisory panel that included researchers who have postulated that hiv does not cause the disease a position long rejected by the overwhelming majority of scientists now mr mbeki is embarking on his first state visit to the united states since succeeding nelson mandela as president last year and activists and those who treat aids are wondering how to greet him most seem to have decided that the best offense is to give no offense an approach that they say is being counseled by the clinton administration the suggestion has been not to press him hard said martin delaney founding director of san francisco based project inform a treatment information and advocacy group the fear here is that he 'll dig in worse if he gets pressured some activists are preparing a statement to be signed by prominent scientists worldwide reaffirming their view that hiv or human immunodeficiency virus causes aids others are planning to try to speak to mr mbeki when he appears in san francisco on wednesday two days after meeting president clinton at the white house we 're all struggling with how best to make a difference said jane silver vice president for public policy at the american foundation for aids research in washington finally the world is focusing on aids in africa part of the challenge is making sure it is not sidetracked there are no simple answers to what to do about the president coming here how to respond to the challenges he 's created she said some scientists are hoping the government will arrange a meeting with prominent american researchers to put mr mbeki on what they consider the right path although administration officials say they have no such plans about six weeks ago several scientists wrote to sandra l thurman the white house director of national aids policy to express concern about south african government contacts with the dissident scientists who are led by peter duesberg and david rasnick both professors in california for advocates and scientists the stakes are high in a country where nearly 1 out of 10 people is infected with hiv they say that by reopening the debate mr mbeki is hampering efforts to control the disease the effects could go further mr delaney and others argue if the message seeps in that aids does not spread by a transmittable virus people may ignore admonitions to practice safe sex and given mr mbeki 's stature in africa and among blacks elsewhere any comfort that he gives to the hiv denialists will feed the fires of those who claim that aids is a conspiracy by the west aimed at third world people mr delaney said mr mbeki 's 33 member aids panel met on may 6 according to an activist who attended the meeting david scondras of boston the dissidents voiced their view that hiv does not cause aids they said screening blood supplies was a waste of money and accused the moderator of bias mr scondras said south african officials who were present were taken aback mr mbeki addressed the scientists and appeared to distance himself from the dissidents he said he knew that hiv caused aids but wanted to explore why a certain subgroup of the virus is more prevalent in africa than in the west and whether poverty and malnutrition are likely causes those factors along with drug use anti aids drugs themselves and parasites are often cited by the dissidents as causes mr mbeki adopted a different tone in a letter to president clinton and other world leaders last month accusing those condemning his approach of waging a campaign of intellectual intimidation and terrorism in the past mr mbeki has said the expense of providing azt is far greater than south africa can afford many activists praise the south african leader for striving to understand aids in an african context where female to male transmission is much more common than in the west and few question his commitment to fighting the disease what he 's done here is akin to if president clinton decided that he 's going to determine the orbital trajectory of the next space mission mr delaney said it 's an intrusion of a leader into an area that 's not his expertise
 directed by john t ryan not rated 74 minutes john t ryan 's film freaks glam gods and rock stars is more than just a far reaching catalog of the kaleidoscopic area of new york 's underground rock scene in which punk drag and performance art giddily collide this movie is an unabashed if often barbed celebration of new york as the one place on earth where you can be your most outrageous gender bent self be appreciated for it and even make money at it if many of the people interviewed for the film especially the hair stylists makeup artists and event organizers are more legends in their own minds than in real life others like the lady bunny who founded the wigstock drag festival and jayne county the punk rock transsexual who claims to be the first rock act to play at cbgb the nightclub where punk first flourished in the 1970 's are genuine underground legends whose sheer endurance on the scene ensures at least a footnote in the history of the city 's bohemian culture instead of viewing this world as a cultural sideshow the movie is genuinely curious about its subjects lives and points of view as well appreciative of their provocative carefully groomed images in interviewing the performers the film which opens today at the den of cin at two boots video 44 avenue a at east third street east village moves from topic to topic the question how would you change new york yields answers that range from free subways to the return of rent control along with many complaints about the giuliani administration 's rigorous enforcement of the city 's cabaret laws the performers are especially revealing when describing how liberating it feels to put on an outrageous costume swab your face with makeup and become a character of your own invention among the film 's more invigorating performances are a bluntly obscene and funny bump and grind number by ms county a swath of slick fashion oriented pop by donovan leitch jason nesmith and their band nancy boy kembra phaler and her wittily allusive rock fright show the voluptuous horror of karen black and dean johnson and his band the velvet mafia sneering an insinuating anthem about male prostitution this is real unvarnished downtown new york culture tough defiant and proud and presented without a trace of the leering condescension that is often lavished on the scene in a spirit of exploitation stephen holden
 president bush finally turns out to have a clear forceful plan to deal with north korea 's defying the west by restarting its nuclear warhead assembly line the plan is to invade iraq the white house is trying to play down the crisis on the korean peninsula so that it can focus public attention on iraq instead but north korea raises risks that iraq does not because it already has a couple of nuclear weapons as well as artillery and missiles that can dump nerve gas on american military bases in asia and taepodong missiles that can drop nuclear warheads on alaska and soon the lower 48 states washington 's failure to engage north korea has in a few months turned a minor problem a uranium program that would take years to produce weapons into a major crisis the restarting of a reactor with enough plutonium to produce five additional warheads now the administration is allowing the situation to drift on a trajectory that conceivably could end up as another korean war the potential threat posed by north korea at this point is worse than anything else that we face said james laney a former ambassador to south korea this needs to be attended to now at the highest levels of this administration we need to get engaged with south korea and figure out how to solve this diplomatically since war would be catastrophic an official with an international organization puts it this way north korea scares the hell out of me i 've been there and it petrifies me by comparison iraq does n't scare me at all perhaps it 's a cheap shot to complain about north korea policy because the north is a country made for pundits here in the peanut gallery it 's possible to write with withering scorn about any alternative the administration could choose all our options regarding north korea are hideous and those responsible for making policy on north korea must have committed mortal sins in previous lives for god to torture them so to his credit mr bush has so far shown a most un bushian patience in reacting to north korean provocation we now find ourselves with three choices first we can negotiate with north korea which shows some signs of seeking the same kind of tentative opening to the west that china pursued in the late 1970 's the downside is that negotiation would reward bad behavior and so mr bush has ruled out this option second we can ignore north korea focus on iraq and hope that economic pressure brings the dear leader kim jong il to his senses that 's what washington is trying now but it 's not working in fact north korea 's economy is doing better than in the 1990 's and if it were pinched north korea could always raise cash by say selling smallpox virus to al qaeda and even if we succeeded in squeezing north korea economically we would be bothered much more than the dear leader as tens of thousands of koreans died of famine and disease third we can launch a military strike on the yongbyon reactor but north korea would probably respond by turning south korea and american bases there into what it describes as a sea of flames i think they would respond by shooting artillery toward south korea and missiles toward japan said kongdan oh author of an excellent book on north korea these are three terrible choices but a president 's job is to pick the least awful and hands down that 's the first one negotiation one way to hide our embarrassment at talking would be to get russia to convene an international conference in which the dear leader would give up his nukes and permit inspectors and outside countries would recognize north korea as robert gallucci a former ambassador with long experience in korea put it i do n't have any difficulty with diplomacy backed by force but what i do n't understand is force with no diplomacy ignoring north korea does n't work any better than ignoring a rambunctious toddler it just encourages further provocation next north korea may begin processing fuel rods at yongbyon a step that could give it five to eight more warheads in about four months granted there 's no good north korea policy but it 's still worth finding a better one like holding our nose and negotiating because north korea is already what iraq might become tomorrow e mail nicholas nytimescom
 on the front line of a watery war christian jervis reid braced for the fray his only weapon a willowy wand of crafted bamboo before him lay the languorous curves of the river nadder a slender waterway replete with trout near this old village in the county of wiltshire 100 miles west of london somewhere at the back of his mind were arguments that catching fish was cruel in front of him though was the dimpling of the water that betrayed his prey he cast his line a speckled brown trout rose to his artificial fly after a brief tussle the trout was captured destined for that night 's dinner table that bucolic moment was one that has been repeated on untold occasions since izaak walton a british writer and fisher composed the compleat angler a compendium of lore in the 1650 's but walton 's assessment that god never did make a more calm quiet innocent recreation than angling is now under challenge as rarely before eminent scientists have concluded that despite anglers longstanding protestations to the contrary fish do indeed feel pain when hooked animal rights activists who have fought a stubborn campaign against the hunting of foxes hares and stags now say they feel encouraged in their insistence that anglers should desist from their pastime while fishing might seem fun there 's a terrified animal fighting for its life at the other end of the line said dawn carr of the european branch of the lobby group people for the ethical treatment of animals the royal society an independent scientific research body seems to agree with him in one of its journals the society published research last month by lynne sneddon establishing for the first time she said the existence of nervous system receptors in the head of fish that respond to damaging stimuli by injecting bee venom and acetic acid into the lips of captive rainbow trout the royal society said dr sneddon and other scientists at the roslin institute in edinburgh discovered that the fish displayed profound behavioral and physiological changes over a period of time comparable to those observed in higher mammals after the injections dr sneddon said fish demonstrated 'rocking motion strikingly similar to the kind of motion seen in stressed higher vertebrates like mammals and the trout injected with acetic acid were also observed to rub their lips onto the gravel in the tank and onto the tank walls this indicates the researchers believe that fish can perceive pain the royal society said in a statement contradicting the riverbank lore of anglers drawing on earlier research by prof james rose of the university of wyoming that fish do not feel pain because their brain is incapable of that response dr sneddon said the research did not make her anti angling i would n't say it was cruel as long as the angler is getting the fish out quickly killing and eating it she said that outweighs the short period of discomfort for the fish she did however seem to question the logic used by fishing types to protest her own research a lot of anglers have condemned me for using bee venom she said in an interview if these anglers condemn me for that they are acknowledging that fish feel pain under pressure from the dispute are the 38 million anglers including mr jervis reid a 55 year old banker who make fishing britain 's most popular participatory sport they cast lures artificial flies or baits on or below the waters to catch and often then release species that range from carp in ponds to mackerel at sea by way of myriad others like roach tench bream dace pike grayling trout and on to the aristocratic atlantic salmon when you catch a fish you want to cause it a minimum amount of pain said mr jervis reid in a conversation before his latest capture most good anglers will be very quick about releasing it or dispatching it for the pot he said of course this being britain there are certain connotations of class anglers sitting on the banks of lakes and canals casting maggots and other bait for coarse fish like roach or barbel tend to be seen as a blue collar bunch by those who cast artificial flies for game fish usually trout or salmon but if there is one thing that unites them it 's an animal rights activist you wo n't get any distinction between the various disciplines said martin salter a labor legislator who acts as the government 's spokesman on angling the anti fishing lobby he said is a few extreme vegans it 's nothing we take seriously the new research has prompted a chorus of rebuttal echoing through newspaper columns broadcasts and barroom debate when you hook a fish the fish always will dash away into the far bank or bore away into the deepest water said rodney coldron of the national federation of anglers if there was any pain involved the fish would swim toward the angler to take pressure off the line in more of a scientific vein bruno broughton a scientific adviser to the pro fishing lobby said in our brains there 's a neocortex that 's the part of our brain that is associated with pain and fear fish do n't have that so if fish are feeling pain how are they feeling it with which organ at the back of many anglers minds is the fear that britain 's militant animal rights movement which has disrupted fox hunts threatened scientists performing experiments on animals and blocked exports of calves may also turn on anglers as they fish two years ago militants wearing ski masks and wielding baseball bats threatened an angler in cambridgeshire animal rights activists sent a nail bomb to a fish and chip shop in north wales also in 2001 an activist smashed fishing poles and leapt into the murky waters of the river trent in the english midlands to protest an angling competition people for the ethical treatment of animals placed a newspaper advertisement the same year ms carr said showing a dog with a hook through its lip and the question if you wo n't do it to a dog why do it to a fish

 to the editor women have long been outspoken about wanting the workplace flexibility to more spend time at their children 's activities or at other personal pursuits but women will not get what they want until men admit that they in substantial numbers desire the same thing men are much more reluctant than women to talk about such matters among their friends and to their supervisors to admit these desires is still perceived as being less than committed to work somehow it is all right for women to be perceived as such so this is still considered a women 's issue but it is everybody 's issue phyllis weiss haserot new york city nov 27 the writer is a business consultant

 they are always surprised and they are always sorry when a boxer is carried from the ring with his brain in chaos it was n't supposed to be this way say the people who are making money from the carnage now they are doing it at museums what is next classrooms public squares churches the latest tragedy has taken place at the intrepid sea air space museum a retired aircraft carrier docked on the west side of manhattan on tuesday a warm and lovely evening 2438 paying customers or rather witnesses watched beethavean scottland of maryland age 26 lose consciousness during a bout with george jones as of last night scottland was fighting for his life as bravely as he had fought for his livelihood but he was listed in very critical condition at bellevue hospital it is not at all demeaning to scottland to say that he was damaged for the amusement of paying customers while doing something he wanted and probably loved to do other sports pursue a goal or a home run or a touchdown and injuries happen along the way his sport pursues temporary unconsciousness a minideath that then subsides if everybody is lucky that night this fight happened to be nationally televised on espn2 but hbo is the major player in this grisly business these networks do not distinguish between boxing and other events they carry sports are sports they say and they can not stage the matches in studios they need sites the flashier the better boxing used to be the product of smoky halls and was occasionally permitted into the major stadiums and arenas now it has become the province of the glitzy gambling dens a boxer died at one of donald trump 's casinos two years ago and the donald quite candidly admitted to a certain amount of queasiness at the spectacle of boxing which he could personally avoid by not attending anymore but in this age of dot com riches and urban rejuvenation and disposable income boxing commands other sites the lovely new stadium in coney island keyspan park will be used for boxing next saturday apparently 38 minor league baseball games will not generate enough revenue one of these nights the public utility and the brooklyn cyclones and the city that spent 39 million to build the stadium might be associated with death or brain damage do they want this there is also boxing at the hammerstein ballroom at the manhattan center where rock groups normally turn up the amps boxers will attempt to turn out each other 's lights perhaps permanently and the world 's most famous arena as madison square garden is called has returned to being an enabler of brain bashing after a period of disengagement as a longtime advocate of the abolition of boxing i do n't guess there is much difference between one abattoir and another but i confess to being outraged that the latest horror took place on the intrepid this vessel helped defend the united states during three wars from 1943 to 1974 and later served in space missions and cold war maneuvers as laura lee of the new york times noted yesterday the ship has survived seven bomb attacks five kamikaze strikes and one torpedo hit it was also used for boxing matches between sailors or fighters brought in to entertain the troops now the obscenity is that schoolchildren and tour groups go to the intrepid to marvel at the sacrifices and skills of people who served in a noble cause boxers are no less admirable than military people they undoubtedly bring the same hungers the same bravery the same hopes and fears but the cause is different to make a few bucks the intrepid was leased out for a boxing spectacle while people were dining and drinking in the pleasure spots of manhattan on a gorgeous summer evening paying customers collected on the deck of the intrepid the skyline was amazing and the sunset was amazing folks were going to get their money 's worth scottland took a ferocious pounding from jones early in their light heavyweight fight scottland had passed his physicals everything was in order or so they say the doctor on duty apparently expressed some concern when scottland was battered in the seventh round but then the boxer rebounded only to fall in the 10th round and then it was too late beethavean scottland lay in the ring and then they took him to the hospital straight from the deck of the intrepid the people entrusted to run this museum will say but it was n't supposed to happen this way people always say that after a boxer is carried out

 president bush and gov gray davis who are deeply at odds on california 's energy problems have one thing in common plunging approval ratings among california 's aggrieved voters yesterday 's meeting between the two did little to bridge the gap on energy and may have done even less to improve their political fortunes as expected mr davis asked mr bush for federal price caps on the soaring cost of wholesale electricity and threatened to sue the federal government if the caps were not forthcoming according to state estimates california paid 7 billion for electricity in 1999 and may pay 10 times that amount this year but mr bush refused repeating his view that caps will make california 's problems worse in the long run by discouraging new investments in power plants for mr davis the issue is partly political he is up for re election next year and still has designs on the democratic presidential nomination but he hurt himself by moving too slowly to raise rates on consumers and businesses a move rightly urged by the administration to encourage conservation and he was unlucky enough to be governor at a time when the state began suffering the effects of a grievously flawed deregulation plan mr bush for his part may be able to get along without california but it is not clear that his party can only one statewide elected official is a republican and california democrats have targeted several republican members of congress whose defeat in 2002 could weaken if not end republican control over the house of representatives the bush forces say they have done plenty for california including expediting federal permits for new plants and ordering conservation measures at federal facilities but nothing would help more than a temporary cap on wholesale electricity prices like the one envisaged in a bill sponsored by senators dianne feinstein of california and gordon smith of oregon it would ease the drain on california 's treasury release electricity that is currently being withheld in expectation of higher prices and address the administration 's fears about investment by guaranteeing producers a reasonable profit mr bush stubbornly clings to his position that this is essentially california 's problem not washington 's but if the problem ripples beyond california 's borders that stubbornness could cost him support in the nation at large
 the second baseman was habitually recalling some of his positive baseball experiences laying them out as immaculately as the uniforms in a marine 's closet how his uncle eddie implored him to stifle teams with defense how he went to spring training 10 years ago as a class aa player and vowed that the minnesota twins would keep him how he thinks that he will be remembered most for helping the yankees win three world series titles not for throwing baseballs so haphazardly that he was benched and pondered retirement the words tumble out of chuck knoblauch 's mouth in an avalanche of theories if you ask the questions knoblauch has the answers long rambling answers almost everything knoblauch utters is about positive reinforcement seemingly a sign that the therapy he has intimated receiving has centered around remembering the good forgetting the bad eliminating distractions and treating every day like the new 24 hours that it is as knoblauch plowed through a meal of chicken and vegetables and three bottles of water in the yankees clubhouse recently he chatted for an hour about why he will conquer the throwing problems that have dogged him since the 1998 season knoblauch has pride but he is also a realist that is why he came here one month earlier than necessary that is why he apparently had off the field counseling he needed the help this year it 's just different knoblauch said i 'm more comfortable and more relaxed i know what 's going on i know the plan i know what i have to do i 'm not concerned with anyone else in a good way not a selfish way i 'm doing what i have to do to get myself ready to play with that comes more focus and blinders i can focus on drills instead of the other stuff flying around if he were a witness testifying on his own behalf a jury would believe him it would believe that the 32 year old knoblauch will not worry about having a microscope focused on him every time he cocks his right arm to throw knoblauch talked about amazing myself with how i 've held my head up through some of this and added i know i can do it and i will do it still no matter how convincing knoblauch sounds the ritual starts again on thursday and his actions will speak for him knoblauch must throw the ball straight you can write it you can say it people can ask me whatever they want i do n't care he said if i go out there and play that stuff will die as far as how fast it will die that will be up to whoever 's in control of that obviously knoblauch controls that he should realize that if knoblauch throws bullets to first base the kind of throws he has been making for the last six days here the questions will fade no throwing errors will translate into no stories about throwing errors as optimistic as knoblauch has been history should make the yankees wary after going the first 32 first games of the 2000 season without a throwing error knoblauch made one on may 12 and that began a troublesome stretch in which he made 13 errors 11 on throws in the next 36 games knoblauch who fidgets with his batting gloves before every pitch and who tinkers with his approach at the plate often must not stray from his new philosophy of accentuating the positive and forgetting the past in the past knoblauch 's last error has sometimes led to a batch of errors i 'm looking to tomorrow knoblauch said and that 's it manager joe torre described knoblauch as an unhappy young man who played in a fishbowl last season and he sounded relieved that knoblauch seems confident torre repeated that knoblauch will be his leadoff man no matter what the result is out there and said that he will not search for alternatives if knoblauch is struggling as late as june if something is n't right i 'd just as soon be surprised by it than expect it torre said i just sense he 's a different guy right now the yankees are scrutinizing knoblauch more than any other player because they have an oral agreement for a two year 18 million contract extension and they will undoubtedly try to settle for a lesser amount if knoblauch 's woes persist knoblauch pleaded ignorance about the existence of an agreement but he compared his attitude now to the one he had as a rookie with the twins in 1991 when his goal was to put pressure on them by playing well he surprisingly made the team that season won the rookie of the year award and helped the twins win a title i want to play here knoblauch said sounding as if he were auditioning again i want to be a yankee knoblauch never worried about defense until three years ago as his uncle eddie used to say beat them with your glove knoblauch said it is vital for him to get back to that high level of defensive play he displayed when he won a gold glove in 1997 and he said it with more confidence than ever before but knoblauch 's words will seem hollow until he does it the confidence is nice the actions matter the ritual starts again on thursday knoblauch must throw the ball straight
 what time is it there was shown as part of the 39th new york film festival in 2001 here are excerpts from elvis mitchell 's review which appeared in the new york times on sept 29 the full text is available at nytimescom the film in mandarin taiwanese and french with english subtitles opens today in manhattan what time is it there the newest film from the taipei director tsai ming liang may be one of the most unusual in some time this work certainly stands alone among cinematic achievements this year mr tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare unchecked heartache of yasujiro ozu but mr tsai has devised a storytelling style here that is both a natural evolution of his previous filmmaking and his most fully realized directing to date with scenes that also combine the seemingly disparate methods of ozu robert bresson and jacques tati in finding his own way mr tsai sets loose shock waves of comedy which both unleash a wave of euphoria in the audience and communicate the pleasure he gets from filmmaking yet the huge laughs do n't come at the expense of the deeply moving scenario which is reminiscent of a barely tapped genre the absurdist melodrama something we need now more than ever like the characters that people ozu 's filmography a group of people in time look for the connection of family and are stupefied by their inability to connect it begins with a wordless tableau in which a man miao tien his face sagging with misery walks into a room and slumps into a chair exhaling doleful plumes of smoke from his cigarettes he turns out to be the father of the household which never recovers from his death his son hsiao kang lee kang sheng is stuck in a house where his distraught mother lu yi ching is watching for signs of her husband 's reincarnation hsiao kang makes his living selling watches on the streets of taipei although he derides his mother for clinging to the possibility of an otherworldly sign he holds on to a dual time wristwatch that may have some connection to his departed father a determined customer chen shiang chyi hectors him into selling her the watch she 's going to paris and ca n't wait for him to order another of the same make she brings him a cake in gratitude for relenting and his world is never the same he becomes obsessed with resetting every clock he sees in stores movie theaters and a huge public clock atop a building to paris time his tenuous connection to her perhaps it is also his way of reaching out to the watch and what it represented mr tsai 's confidence as a filmmaker has grown and is in full flower here time has depths that the river his last collaboration with miao tien suggested mr tsai has noted that seeing time after the river will add to the levels of ambiguity that unite the two stylistically the bloom on the jokes in the frame is beguiling since he plants the camera and allows the action to unfold at its own pace he never moves the camera and he traps the actors and the tension inside each frame every scene plays out with a different rhythm and pops with the startling surprise of a perfect tag the stillness mr tsai uses here displays his newly deepened trust in his actors ms chen never makes a wrong move so in tune is she with the alienation and desire time requires she has a wonderful scene that crystallizes the theme of miscommunication with jean pierre leaud who has n't been this well used since his cameo in the marvelous vie de boheme which had a similar cool hand freakishness mr lee is one of the most gifted straight men in movies his bright swift takes are an apt contrast to the flintiness in the early scene of his dad mr lee 's reactions grow out of his steadily increasing bewilderment he also matches up with the bold businesslike hurt of ms lu who moves decisively in fashioning a home her dead husband will feel safe returning to it 's her only mission mr tsai may not have been reaching for it but he and his co screenwriter yang pi ying labor in a nouvelle vague version of a strindberg sitcom it 's a film about characters marooned in their own skins who can not communicate with the most important people in their worlds this director is also destiny 's child he benefits from some of the best luck ever to befall a filmmaker a scene featuring a cockroach and a pet fish with a huge off white noggin is worth the entire film the most intoxicatingly perverse scene in films this year it sets a benchmark others will ape in trying to create a plangent comic reality the mordantly beautiful cinematography by benoit delhomme complements rather than overstates the action in what time is it there a question that also refers to the world that hsiao kang 's father may now inhabit the quotidian serenity is continually broken by dottiness and the camera never blinks mr tsai has the patience not to cut away after a joke he makes the camera an impartial unshakable observer he not only gives the audience a chance to breathe but also lets us luxuriate in the mood of deadpan melancholy his movie evokes so beautifully

 symphony concerts and operas tend to be such solemn affairs that like the one eyed man in the realm of the blind even the bad joke resounds this would explain the successful premise of peter schickele 's p d q bach concerts but not their durability these 37 year old evening length lampoons returned to avery fisher hall on friday night with the familiar props intact a made up baroque composer the disheveled mr schickele as lecturer conductor and performer the dour stage manager william walters a first class pickup orchestra gracefully conducted by ken jean a handful of odd instruments and a faithful audience well drilled in the rituals of these events the first class orchestra is no mere luxury given the sophistication of mr schickele 's musical burlesques it needs to be it is the layers meticulously applied that keep p d q bach from disappearing giggling into air vents above peel away the musicological puns and beneath them you will find correct german turned against itself the howdy volkstheater was a discovery for me look past the absurdity of professor schickele 's fictional teaching post and you will sense the desperation of a minor academic buried in some plains state university system the pratfalls and other physical humor can be lame but so carefully honed into the year in year out p d q bach routine that they are not only awaited but demanded the outer layers of the p d q bach music begin with titles desecration of the house schleptet the civilian barber two and a half variations and continue with misplaced orchestral toots and bangs we have also come to laugh almost automatically at evergreen quotes from brahms stravinsky and popular song as they emerge from baroque boilerplate but underneath other things are going on sophisticated interruptions cleverly placed accents an off kilter stream of music that always makes sense a delicate ear for instrumental combinations chaconne a son gout was both a laugh a second and an impressive ivesian haze of metric turmoil and ingenious contrapuntal dovetailing there was no necessity to hear beyond the musical saw and koto in combination or related nonsense like it but quality is usually sensed even by those not looking for it it keeps one coming back without necessarily knowing why if there is a certain tiredness to the p d q bach phenomenon that may be another layer of its charm mr schickele 's creation has more or less engulfed his other life as a composer and a very good one he is but he seems to accept with wry benevolence the unavoidable if distracting fame and fortune that has befallen him playing the bassoon in public as he did with near adequacy on friday also tends to keep him and his mythical partner on their toes
 the port authority of new york and new jersey has begun moving on a major project that was delayed for nearly a year as the governors of the two states squabbled over the agency 's spending leasing the world trade center to private interests since the dispute was settled this month the port authority has quietly sent proposals to about 30 large real estate concerns inviting them to bid on taking over the center under a 99 year lease the deal has been made potentially richer because of the delay estimates are now that it could produce 2 billion or more for the agency over time up from the 15 billion projected a year ago agency officials and real estate experts note that when privatization or leasing of the center was first proposed six years ago the new york city real estate market was still recovering from a glut of overbuilding in the 1980 's that made it hard to lease space in the twin towers and other lower manhattan office buildings since then occupancy rates as well as rents at the world trade center have crept steadily upward as vacancy rates in all of lower manhattan for top grade office space has dropped to less than 3 percent for the authority it is exceptionally good timing and good demand said wayne lagary of julian j studley the national 's oldest tenant representative firm and a tenant itself of the world trade center the 18 month standoff between gov george e pataki and gov christine todd whitman had blocked agreement on such major projects as the world trade center lease the leasing of air rights over the port authority bus terminal and ratification of a lease for a major port tenant that impasse ended june 1 when the governors agreed on a package of spending initiatives that provided something for both states the world trade center 's move from public ownership and operation to private operation if completed would mark a journey of light years for the office complex which was derided as folly in 1966 when gov nelson a rockefeller and his brother david the chase manhattan bank president pushed for its construction the plan was criticized then by private developers who feared it would flood the market with excess office space and by environmentalists who warned that it would pollute the hudson river with raw sewage even broadcast companies opposed it for fear that it would interfere with the signals they beamed from the empire state building to angus kress gillespie a professor of american studies at rutgers university and author of the recently released twin towers the life of new york city 's world trade center there is delicious irony in it all the real estate industry that criticized the project is now cherry picking it as one of the port authority 's most valuable assets cherrie nanninga director of real estate for the port authority said the rest of the world was also coming to recognize the architectural value and efficient design of the 16 acre 10 million square foot complex which contains more office space than is found in all of downtown cincinnati in stringing together such figures ms nanninga is practicing for the road trip that she and the agency 's consultants on the deal j p morgan cushman wakefield and millstein realty will be making to the 30 companies that have received the two volume four inch thick offering memorandum that details the lease arrangement 's requirements she expects bids back from those still interested by aug 31 when the agency will draw up a short list of bidders who will receive more detailed and proprietary information so that they can develop a final proposal lewis eisenberg chairman of the port authority said he hoped the center would be leased within a year although the agency would not disclose which 30 companies were deemed qualified to receive the offering memorandum some people familiar with the proposals said privately that the companies include donald trump 's organization tishman speyer gale wentworth mortimer zuckerman 's boston properties and the canadian firm brookfield real estate but a major question shadowing any deal is what position new york city will take on the real estate taxes paid by the complex the port authority now pays the city 275 million in lieu of real estate taxes and deputy mayor anthony p coles said that the taxes on such property would be 100 million a year it is the city 's position as well as the state 's that any successful private bidder pay the full tax mr coles said

 a regretful patrick ewing wished the knicks could have put more talent around him in his prime rather than his twilight he also fondly recalled the day he stood on the scorer 's table and lifted his arms high calling new york 's victory over indiana in the 1994 playoffs his greatest memory in some of the most candid moments of his 15 year career new york 's former franchise center spent almost 20 minutes today reminiscing about his days in orange and blue as the sonics worked out at the celtics practice facility preparing for their game at boston on monday night two days before an expected emotional return to madison square garden for the first time since he was traded last year to seattle ewing used equal parts reflection and humor to sum up his knick career it 'll be strange but i 'm going to do everything the way i 've always done it he said of his return i 've already told them i 'm driving my car up the ramp like i always did if the guards stop me i 'm running them over he joked about jeff van gundy 's penchant for running into the fray of on court fights about his former knick teammate mark jackson newly arrived back in new york boasting that he would dunk over ewing on tuesday but ewing also took time to voice fresh opinions on team business his most telling comment taking aim at a franchise he felt could have done more to win a title during his tenure there are some things i wish the knicks organization could have done to make the team better when i was younger than when i was older and hopefully we could have gotten a ring ewing said unprompted he also admitted approaching his agent david falk earlier in his career about trying to swing a deal with one or more of his clients to help the knicks win a title it never happened ewing said that 's life that 's in the past with the usual assortment of ice bags wrapped around his knees and wrists surrounded by replicas of the 16 championship banners won by boston ewing deftly bantered with a dozen reporters many flying in from new york to ask him about the feelings that will tug at him when his name is announced on tuesday night if i 'm going to cry is that what you want to know he asked no i hope not he added that he watched the knicks beat sacramento this afternoon that he still kept in close contact with van gundy and that the knicks would always have a special place in my heart nearly 20 years ago ewing sat at the podium of satch 's restaurant in downtown boston leaning awkwardly toward a microphone he announced the word georgetown and sat back and awaited the questions the inquiries then were about his immense talent and all the possibilities that could happen with ewing a 7 foot prodigy from the cambridge rindge and latin school in the middle of a defense two decades later he is slogging upcourt at 38 years old trying to siphon one more contract out of a team that will pay him when his current deal expires seattle is not expected to sign ewing again his minutes and role have been reduced with the sonics but he still believes he has much to offer the game time flies he said when asked to remember the day the knicks won the first draft lottery in 1985 and celebrated their good fortune it 's 16 years down the road but i 'm 16 years wiser i 've made mistakes in my life but if i had to do it all over again a lot of the thing i did i 'd do the same friends since they became teammates jackson and ewing have teased each other about his return on tuesday he told me he was going to dunk on me ewing said so i told him i was going to be waiting for him at the basket i would be awfully disappointed if it were anything but a standing ovation jackson said in new york earlier today anticipating ewing 's return he is nothing but a warrior and the greatest knick ever van gundy said the greatest knick to ever play is coming back for his first game he should be warmly received after that they 'll get on him just like every other visiting player asked to recall his best garden memory ewing said beating indiana to go to the finals i just remember being on the floor celebrating with everybody of the reception he is expecting tuesday he said i think they respect everything i 've done in my 15 year career in new york what do i expect i do n't know hopefully it 'll be a warm homecoming if not so be it
 attorney general janet reno has correctly asserted that the tangled case of elian gonzalez the 6 year old cuban boy now living with relatives in miami must be decided under federal immigration law not in the florida courts her declaration will not settle the complicated dispute that pits the clinton administration and the immigration and naturalization service against congressional conservatives and anti castro cubans in miami but it is a start toward legal clarity which represents the best road out of a mess where political agreement will never be possible as ms reno acknowledged in a letter to lawyers for the boy 's miami relatives the ins created great confusion with its initial announcement that it could not grant custody and that such a request would have to be put before the state courts but as a matter of law the ins has authority to make the determination that elian 's father in cuba is the boy 's lawful guardian immigration law experts agree that the florida family court that intervened in the case by awarding temporary custody to a great uncle in miami does not have the authority to overrule the ins ms reno said in her letter that the government was prepared to go to federal court to enforce its primacy in the case and it should do so promptly state federal jurisdictional disputes were common in civil rights cases in the 60 's and experience shows that calm persistence in asserting the primacy of federal law is the best course cooling off periods can be valuable too so the ins decision to extend the jan 14 deadline for returning the boy to his father was prudent that will give time for resolving the legal disputes it is too much to hope of course that political passions will burn themselves out in that time as one anti castro leader in miami said elian has become a symbol of that community 's 41 years of frustration with fidel castro and with its shorter term anger at the clinton administration but it is possible that the hysteria in congress with its plans to bring elian to washington to testify or grant him instant citizenship will recede in hindsight it is clear that the ins should have acted more confidently and promptly but the fact that the ins let relatives in miami care for the boy does not give them a custody claim that overrides federal law elian has remained in the exclusive legal custody of the federal government since his arrival the ins correctly determined that the boy 's father juan miguel gonzalez is his sole lawful guardian and has the right to make the decision to have the child returned to cuba there is no basis in law for overturning mr gonzalez 's claim because he lives in a communist country the clinton administration has the legal authority to enforce the ins decision immediately but the sounder and less disruptive course would be as ms reno suggested in her letter to settle the matter in the proper federal court that should take place before the florida judge rosa i rodriguez convenes her evidentiary hearing on march 6 and further stirs up the local community as well as those in congress and on the presidential campaign trail who want to take advantage of this case
 the st patrick pageant promised to be a rich mixture of history and legend spiced with both sanctity and irreverence instead it was like an irish stew with too many ingredients the madcap extravaganza offered on thursday night at the joyce soho combined text and choreography by clare byrne with original music by rodrigo joaquin alonzo and jason crigler and a taped collage that included various folk and blues songs a lot happened elmer moore jr was a perpetually antic st patrick jennifer a cooper who also designed the costumes many of them appropriately green portrayed the saint 's accordion playing lamb amy larimer and ruben ortiz were clouds theresa palazzo sarah carlson and donna bouthillier played several creatures including snakes mr alonzo the singing narrator spent much time sitting on a toilet in this production designed by matt allar predictably the show had its share of toilet jokes some of the strands in the many story lines dealt with moving from mexico to the united states vain attempts to leave topeka kan and of course st patrick who got entangled sometimes in an implicitly erotic fashion with the creatures the slinky snakes hissed and twisted but sins were apparently forgiven at the conclusion it was hard to care much about all this characterizations were insufficiently vivid and the shifts from ireland to topeka in the multitude of plots and subplots seemed muddled rather than stimulatingly complex the st patrick pageant soon became theatrical blather jack anderson
 the ancient chinese were probably right to insist that their mirrors were magical the lustrous reflective bronze surfaces delivered wondrous illusions that could easily be seen as supernatural the backs were fascinating too awash with circular patterns and reliefs of mythological images that told powerful stories of deities and the calligraphic maxims on them carried messages of good fortune and happiness for their owners if nothing else the producers of these artifacts were wizards at marketing throughout the 3500 years that bronze mirrors were produced in china from the shang dynasty in 1600 bc to the qing dynasty in the late 18th century they were never treated as merely cosmetic tools rather they were valued even revered as cultural objects and often incorporated into rituals making them status symbols for merchants and aristocrats at court if you lived at a time when there were no reflective surfaces the first mirrors must have seemed magical said thomas lynn carter a 69 year old retired radiologist in madison wis who acquired 143 mirrors with his wife martha limback carter 66 an art scholar amassed over 30 years the carters collection while short on masterpieces is one of the finest and most comprehensive outside asia it documents the golden age of these artifacts from 475 bc in the warring states period to about ad 1800 in the qing dynasty once the couple had completed the collection in 1995 they donated it to the cleveland museum of art now 90 of the objects are on view in circles of reflection the carter collection of chinese bronze mirrors at the china institute the show originated in 2000 at the cleveland museum and was organized by its curator of chinese art ju hui chou who also wrote the catalog mrs carter has been a passionate collector mainly of metal objects since childhood she began buying chinese bronze mirrors in 1969 when they were still available for as little as 100 to 200 each bronze was always my favorite metal she said already owning some luristan bronzes she became interested in chinese bronzes in 1962 when she began working on her phd in asian art history at case western reserve university in cleveland she studied with sherman e lee an asian art expert who was the director of the cleveland museum of art mrs carter grew up a few blocks from the museum which she visited often until she was a teenager and her family moved to michigan she returned to the city in 1955 with her husband who worked there at the lewis laboratory of the national aeronautics and space administration in 1969 the couple moved to madison when mr carter changed jobs they searched for bronzes mostly on holidays and business trips while building the collection they kept in touch with mr lee and when they gave it to the museum it was in his honor the carters say they got the most pleasure from the hunt for their treasures but handling the objects deepened their understanding of how the mirrors as well as all chinese bronzes evolved the basic disc form of chinese mirrors remained unchanged for 3500 years on one side was a reflective surface on the other a decorative surface cast in relief with a knob in the center for holding the mirror or carrying it with an attached cord some mirrors were square and from about ad 1100 in the song dynasty a small number were fitted with handles most were palm size though the diameter ranged from a few inches on miniatures to more than 15 inches on those made for dressing tables and ceremonial use the decoration on mirror backs changed many times over the centuries as did the imagery on massive vessels and sculpture in the warring states period ending in 221 bc geometric and abstract motifs were mixed with stylized leaves serpents and dragons under the han from 206 bc to ad 8 geometric designs reigned tang artists 818 to 907 stressed boldness by combining crouching animals with abundant grapevines and phoenixes with flowers with the song 960 to 1279 restraint was restored in stylized forms and in scenes of legendary gods and men the ming 1368 to 1644 preferred plain surfaces calligraphy and on occasion vigorous abstractions of dragons and birds while scholars and archaeologists have made great advances in the knowledge of chinese bronzes many mirrors continue to defy explanation a dark and shimmering one from the warring states period for example bears four boldly graphic slanted t 's that remain a mystery the t 's seem to relate to the chinese ideogram shan for mountain but until the rosetta stone for chinese bronzes is found no one will know for sure whether four mountains are depicted on this artifact and others like it bronze mirrors were eclipsed in the 18th century when the looking glass was introduced from the west but traditional objects lingered in rituals as is seen in the only mirror in the exhibition that boasts a handle and is not bronze but brass now faded to gray produced about 1800 it was probably made for use at a wedding judging from the calligraphy emblazoning the back which delivers the hallmark like message double happiness and is circled by images of five bats signifying good fortune mirrors whether made of metal or glass have retained their talismanic power in chinese culture into the late 19th century the imperial guards wore polished silver discs as amulets on their uniforms instead of decorations and the carters have seen late 20th century evidence that mirrors are still mystical we were in singapore 's old town in the 1990 's and saw a huge convex mirror hung on a building at a busy corner mrs carter said i thought it was a modern touch allowing drivers to see the traffic ahead coming around the corner but our guide corrected me saying that it was there to keep all the evil spirits that came whizzing down the street from turning the corner it was there to frighten them with their own reflections forcing them to turn back for today 's viewers bronze mirrors pose a more practical problem most people when they saw our collection asked us 'how in the world could anyone see their reflection in these mr carter said looking at them must have been at best like peering into clear dark water and seeing an image softened as if viewed through gauze perhaps that was part of the appeal images that are less accurate might seem more mystical circles of reflection the carter collection of

 complaints of possibly tainted bottled water mounted in the metropolitan region yesterday even as law enforcement officials said that thus far they had not discerned any link or pattern to the reports although local and federal authorities have yet to find any evidence of bottle tampering they have not ruled out the possibility of foul play all of the bottles of suspect water are being turned over to the federal bureau of investigation for testing the critical question as to whether or not any of these instances are linked has not yet been answered said joseph valiquette the fbi spokesman in the new york office nor do we have the answer to the question as to whether a crime has been committed mr valiquette would not say how many reports were being investigated saying we 're not going to get into a numbers game the city police and state health officials have reported at least 12 incidents involving complaints of potentially contaminated bottled water 9 in the city and 1 each in westchester suffolk and rockland counties i think that obviously it 's serious said claire pospisil a spokeswoman for the state health department i do n't think we really know the answer to how widespread it is mayor rudolph w giuliani announced at a news conference on wednesday that there had been three incidents of people becoming sick after drinking bottled water between aug 3 and sept 6 although no one was seriously ill the incidents have unnerved many people and led to concerns among the authorities that the contamination could have been deliberate city officials said that at first these three reports seemed to be isolated incidents so there was no public announcement only recently did the city health department determine that the contaminants in the three reported cases were similar said deputy commissioner sandra mullin ms mullin described two of the contaminants found in separate bottles as ammonia and sodium hydroxide health officials still have not identified the third contaminant she said although it had a similar alkalinity to the others one early theory was that a contaminant might have been inserted into plastic water bottles with a hypodermic syringe said an official familiar with the investigation but he added the preliminary indication is that is not the case investigators are looking into each report individually since the circumstances vary so far the incidents have involved perrier poland spring and aquafina water in the first and most serious incident and the only one involving a glass bottle a diner at benihana a japanese steakhouse on west 56th street felt a burning sensation and began bleeding from her mouth after drinking some perrier she was hospitalized for several days with a diagnosis of chemical burns to her mouth and esophagus trace elements of lye were found in the remaining water the police said the original bottle was not recovered but the water had been poured into a glass raising the possibility that it was the glass not the water that had been contaminated the police were looking into a complaint made on thursday by a bronx man who said that he had suffered a burning sensation in his mouth after drinking from a bottle of aquafina water he had bought from a gas station vending machine the man jose pena was taken to jacobi medical center where he was treated and released with no apparent injuries the police said the bottled water was found to contain chlorine bleach the police said a bottle of chlorine bleach was found on a counter at a nearby florist shop where mr pena had gone to drink his water they did not say how bleach had gotten into his water there were no injuries that were diagnosed said a senior investigator working on the case the police seem to be taking each report seriously they took measures for example when a bronx woman reported around 9 pm thursday that she had a burning sensation in her mouth after drinking from a bottle of aquafina water the police said she had not sought medical treatment at the time the authorities said but thought she should report the incident after seeing a story about the bottled water scare on the evening news about 11 30 that night a detective contacted the store where the woman had bought the water rosa frasca groceries at 1028 morris park avenue said antonio frasca one of the store 's owners the detective asked that the store take all its aquafina water off the shelf he said the same detective called around 9 30 yesterday morning with questions about the source of the water and the delivery driver and made another request not to sell the water mr frasca said the police told me to pull it off the shelf and not to sell it he said when the police ask you to do something like that you do it i wish i knew something more specific mr frasca said i have to take my water off the shelf meanwhile everyone else is selling it there 's no recall no one tells us anything specific i see other people sell it so i want to know is it something serious
 almost 30 years ago james beard was complaining about the asparagus available in the supermarket nowadays he wrote in american cookery little brown 1972 it is cut shockingly long obviously to increase the weight and the waste is tremendous nothing has changed a pound of asparagus yields only about half a pound of edible stalk your chances of getting a better yield not to mention better flavor are directly proportional to how far the asparagus has traveled the best asparagus is always from your own garden or at least from a field within a couple of hours of the market just like corn those beautiful spears begin to lose their sweetness and tenderness the moment they are picked from march to may their fresh bright spring flavor is at its peak this is the time of year for people who do n't want to load up on cream and butter to make things taste good naked asparagus spears rival peanuts for their ca n't eat just one quality but they have even more advantages for good eating they never appear on the hit parade of meganutritious vegetables like broccoli or carrots but they are little storehouses of some important vitamins that are not easy to get enough of particularly some of the b vitamins a 6 1 2 ounce serving contains a little more than the entire daily recommended daily intake of vitamin a team asparagus with a roasted red pepper salsa and you not only increase the vitamin a but you also add significant amounts of vitamin c i 'd give up carrots for asparagus any day asparagus is one of the better sources of folate or folic acid which helps reduce the risk of two birth defects spina bifida and anencephaly a portion of asparagus 6 1 2 ounces provides 256 micrograms of the nutrient more than half of the recommended daily intake of 400 micrograms a day folate and vitamin b6 have also been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks and while the levels of vitamin b6 are not great in asparagus there is some along with two other b vitamins thiamin and riboflavin a serving of asparagus also has four milligrams of vitamin e about half the daily recommendation when you are in the market for asparagus look for fresh green stalks with tightly budded tips stay away from shriveled bunches and choose spears of the same thickness so they will cook evenly steaming is best and fastest in her book red white and greens harpercollins 1996 faith willinger suggests soaking the trimmed tender spears in sugared water for 30 minutes before cooking and it does restore sweetness do n't combine asparagus with a dressing containing vinegar or lemon juice until just before serving it will make the spears turn yellowish gray green and no asparagus does not have to be peeled as long as the tough end of the stalk has been removed by bending it at the point where it snaps off naturally asparagus with roasted red pepper salsa time 15 minutes 4 roasted red bell peppers 1 tiny hot red pepper like a bird pepper or thai pepper 1 medium clove garlic minced 4 tablespoons minced red onion 2 teaspoons lime juice 1 pound asparagus 1 2 cup chopped cilantro 1 slice red peppers into 1 8 inch wide strips trim and seed hot pepper and mince combine roasted peppers hot pepper garlic and onion add lime juice a little at a time until desired tartness is achieved set aside if using immediately or cover and refrigerate until serving time salsa can be made a day ahead remove from refrigerator before cooking asparagus 2 trim tough part from asparagus by breaking stems at the point where the tender part meets the woody stem wash thoroughly steam asparagus 3 to 7 minutes depending on thickness drain and arrange on a serving plate 3 mix cilantro into salsa and spoon over asparagus yield 2 servings

 to the editor thanks for your fascinating article the house on west 11th street by mel gussow march 5 on the weathermen explosion but what bothered me about this otherwise engrossing account is the statement that next to the wilkersons the boudins and the weathermen themselves the people most affected by the explosion were the owners and residents of the adjoining buildings this is hardly the case surely the parents and friends of the three who died have had far more emotional shrapnel to contend with in their lives than the neighbors who admittedly suffered a calamitous violation of their sense of safety not to mention property damage in fact the three who were killed linger like hidden corpses in the sub basement of the story what led them to their extreme beliefs how did their families cope these are questions not to be dismissed entirely thanks for your attention and for publishing this kind of personal new york history catherine aman gramercy

 nasa officials decided today to delay launching the space shuttle endeavour until next week to allow astronauts aboard the international space station to tackle docking problems with a russian cargo ship before the shuttle arrives endeavour and its crew of seven are now set to blast off for the station at 5 45 pm tuesday a day after a pair of russian astronauts aboard the station take a space walk to the progress cargo craft to remove debris that has prevented a firm docking the shuttle was to have been launched on its 11 day mission on thursday evening but mission managers postponed liftoff for a day to give them time to study how the space station problems might affect the shuttle flight after conferences among nasa authorities and their russian counterparts officials decided to keep endeavour on its launching pad until at least tuesday to see if the problems could be corrected before the shuttle flies james van laak nasa 's manager of station operations said at a news conference today that resolving the progress docking difficulty is not a major problem and that the shuttle should be able to work around it to link up with the station and begin its resupply mission next week this is not a high anxiety activity mr van laak said of formulating the new plans and schedule it just takes a lot of work the problem began wednesday when the robotically controlled progress carrying a ton of food fuel and equipment docked with the station 140 miles above the earth although the two craft joined an obstruction kept latches from creating an airtight seal mr van laak said the blockage which initially looked like a piece of rope or cable may be a rubber seal that tore away from the last progress that left the docking port on thanksgiving the principal concern about docking endeavour before the progress is secured is that contact between the shuttle and the station could cause the russian craft to wobble and damage its docking port the russians have planned a four hour space walk for monday by the two russian astronauts in the current station crew mikhail tyurin and lt col vladimir n dezhurov they are part of a crew that has been on the station since august and will be replaced by three astronauts scheduled to arrive aboard endeavour

 chuck jones the animator and director who brought to life bugs bunny daffy duck elmer fudd road runner wile e coyote and other beloved cartoon characters transforming them into worldwide celebrities died on friday at his home in corona del mar calif he was 89 the cause was congestive heart failure his daughter linda jones clough said in a career in animation that spanned nearly 70 years mr jones directed more than 300 films three of which won academy awards in 1996 he also received an oscar for special achievement in recognition of his life 's work mr jones was best known for his work at warner brothers where from 1933 to 1963 in collaboration with other legendary animators including tex avery and friz freleng he helped create bugs daffy porky pig and elmer fudd and other stars of the looney tunes and merry melodies productions and he single handedly invented road runner and wile e coyote which underscored his belief that the success of cartoon characters lay in their acting not in dialogue one of his strict rules for the coyote road runner series was no dialogue ever except 'beep beep the series which made its debut in 1949 was a minimalist revolution with its stark desert setting and the tight parameters of the coyote 's always futile efforts to obliterate his co star other rules were no outside force can harm the coyote only his own ineptitude or the failure of the acme products and the coyote is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures mr jones also invented the gallant gallic skunk pepe le pew marvin martian michigan j frog and gossamer mr jones and his collaborators at warner brothers were so successful in making the carrot chomping bugs bunny into a lifelike celebrity that a child once accused him of being nothing more than a member of the cartoon paparazzi a small child once said to me 'you do n't draw bugs bunny you draw pictures of bugs bunny mr jones said adding that 's a very profound observation because it means that he thinks the characters are alive which as far as i am concerned is true mr jones so identified with his characters that at times he gave interviews on their behalf bugs never anticipated such a fuss in the first place said mr jones on bugs bunny 's 50th birthday bugs had no concept that people would celebrate his 50th because he never thought his pictures would last mr jones said all of us thought they 'd just go into a vault but now they 're even shown in museums charles martin jones was born on sept 12 1912 in spokane wash the fourth child of charles a and mabel jones he was just 6 months old when the family moved to california and as a boy in hollywood he often watched through a fence as charlie chaplin rehearsed his films the young chuck jones also worked as a child extra in mack sennett comedies but he often credited his start in drawing to his father 's succession of failed businesses which left pencils and stationery strewn around the house he dropped out of high school but attended the chouinard art institute he began his career cleaning off cels the transparent sheets that animators used to draw the moving parts of a frame mr jones moved up in the ranks becoming a cel painter a cel inker and eventually an in betweener or assistant animator at one point he was fired by a studio secretary dorothy webster who later became his wife in 1933 he joined leon schlesinger productions which was later sold to warner brothers mr jones was assigned to a newly formed cartoon production unit where daffy duck and porky pig were created in 1938 mr jones directed his first cartoon the night watchman in 1940 he won an award for an animated patriotic cartoon called old glory and during world war ii he worked with theodor s geisel a k a dr seuss on a cartoon about a goofy soldier private snafu a quarter century later mr jones and mr geisel collaborated on the productions of dr seuss how the grinch stole christmas and horton hears a who in 1938 bugs bunny made his debut with a bit part in a cartoon called porky 's hare hunt but it was in 1940 that bugs catapulted to stardom in a wild hare from there mr jones went on to sketch bugs for more than 50 years in those early years all the classic cartoons were drawn in the same fashion that movies were filmed at 24 frames a second when the cartoons reached the peak of their popularity in the 1940 's and 50 's they ran for exactly six minutes and were 540 feet long each requiring 5000 drawings a good animator could do about 15 seconds of film time a week when road runner and wile e coyote made their debut in 1949 mr jones said that his inspiration for the coyote had come from mark twain 's roughing it after warner brothers closed its animation studio in 1962 mr jones worked briefly for disney and later for mgm where he worked on episodes of tom and jerry three of his films won oscars for scent imental reasons 1949 and so much for so little 1949 won oscars that went to the films producers and mr jones himself was awarded the oscar for best short animated film for the dot and the line 1965 mr jones continued drawing until just a month before his death his daughter said his last major film was chariots of fur featuring road runner and wile e coyote which was released by warner brothers in 1996 mr jones 's first wife dorothy died in 1978 aside from his daughter he is survived by his wife marian dern jones of corona del mar a stepson peter dern of los angeles a stepdaughter rosalind bellante of mission viejo calif three grandchildren three stepgrandchildren and six great grandchildren in his autobiography chuck amuck the life and times of an animated cartoonist farrar straus and giroux 1989 mr jones wrote perhaps the most accurate remark about me was uttered by ray bradbury at his 55th birthday party in answer to the usual question 'what do you want to be when you grow up ray replied 'i want to be 14 years old like chuck jones perhaps this will be my most apt possible epitaph correction march 11 2002 monday an obituary on feb 24 about chuck jones the animator who helped create bugs bunny and other characters misspelled the name of the cartoon series they populated it was looney tunes and merrie melodies not merry
 just as we are recovering from the overinflated price of admission and settling into our seats we are blasted by seven or eight ear shattering ads for upcoming films all the money expertise and effort put into the making of movie trailers ignores the irritating fact that the message of each promo is lost in the din of so many as we sit with our hands over our ears for yet another 150 second sell can we recognize a good film from a bad one and by that time do we really care alvin c siskind toms river nj

 the pastor of a presbyterian church in michigan has told his parishioners that a choirmaster who resigned from a princeton nj boarding school 34 years ago over sexual abuse allegations had later been accused of molesting a choirboy at the church and was forced to leave the school in princeton nj the american boychoir school has been sued by a former student who claimed he was molested by a former choirmaster and four other adults at the school in the early 1970 's the school whose students have sung for presidents and at least one pope was the subject of an extensive article in the new york times last week for which a dozen alumni from the 1960 's to the 1980 's described a pattern of sexual abuse by two choirmasters and nine other adults at the school interviews and a review of documents in the pending case turned up accusations from four former choirboys that one choirmaster donald t bryant now 83 molested them in the 1960 's a lawyer who spoke on mr bryant 's behalf robert meader said that mr bryant did not recall abusing choirboys in princeton or leaving the school over allegations he had done so he then went on to say that mr bryant 's record after leaving the boychoir school was unblemished however in a letter friday to 2300 parishioners the rev michael l lindvall pastor of the first presbyterian church in ann arbor mich said that mr bryant was accused of molestation at the church as well mr bryant was hired by the church in 1969 a year after leaving the boychoir school and worked there for 24 years the letter was first reported in the ann arbor news in the letter mr lindvall said that shortly after he took over the church in 1993 a former choirboy who had moved out of the area contacted him to say that mr bryant had abused him a number of times in the early 1970 's when the man was a teenager the man then in his 30 's spoke to mr lindvall and an unnamed colleague also a pastor mr lindvall described an emotional meeting that brought both pastors to tears and said they were convinced of the credibility of the accusation and believed that mr bryant absolutely could not work in the church even if that work were only with adult choirs and even if the abuse had taken place two decades earlier the church required his retirement and he left the church several months later the letter said mr lindvall said a special church commission was investigating mr bryant 's hiring and tenure there i grieve that this great church has been connected with the tragedy and horror of child sexual abuse mr lindvall wrote the fact that the alleged abuse took place decades ago makes little difference the scars last a lifetime mr lindvall said he was moved to explain the dismissal of mr bryant which had triggered confusion and anger among church members nine years before after reading the times article about sexual abuse at the boychoir school yesterday mr bryant did not return a call seeking comment and mr meader said he would not speak on mr bryant 's behalf he said he had been unaware of the 1993 accusation when he spoke earlier a former trustee at the boychoir school told the times that mr bryant had been forced out over a love affair with a student however board minutes from the time make no mention of sexual misconduct and there is no evidence the school ever notified state authorities of the accusations as the law required

 kenneth king 's dance performance at st mark 's church on tuesday night eventually became a book signing during the metamorphosis words danced and movements seemed kinetic messages the event was tied to mr king 's book writing in motion body language technology which has just been published by wesleyan university press since the 1960 's mr king has been combining dance steps with words his texts have ranged from philosophical speculations to word games and his agile body is as quick as his wit at st mark 's mr king was joined by a guest artist frances alenikoff a dancer and writer who shares his love of words and movement the title of their new work hotel tiresias refers to the blind prophet in greek mythology who was granted the power to experience life as both a man and a woman the production made ms alenikoff and mr king seem two aspects of a single oracular personality ms alenikoff sat in a chair chanting ominously and occasionally pounding the floor with a stick mr king wearing dark glasses sped through the space darting and twisting both performers appeared to be casting spells in twilight dust a solo for ms alenikoff she both wailed in a flamboyant manner and spoke of such ordinary things as slamming car doors lentil soup and a child 's desire to dance her stentorian manner gave everything she mentioned cosmic significance mr king quoted passages from his book while he danced in writing in motion he described voices moving through him like sonic rivers called dancing a form of writing in space and recited tongue twisters while jiggling giddily then the audience was invited to talk with mr king and ms alenikoff and books were made available for purchase and signing the program was presented by the church 's danspace project and movement research 25th anniversary performance events in collaboration with the poetry project
 a forecast 15 knot westerly breeze failed to materialize today forcing the cancellation of race 7 in the louis vuitton finals between san francisco 's america one syndicate and italy 's prada challenge the five of nine series to select the next america 's cup challenger remains tied at three apiece racing is scheduled to resume on friday under fresh 15 20 knot southwesterlies when it does paul cayard 's america one team will continue to compete against the well heeled italian squad backed by the fortune of the prada fashion magnate patrizio bertelli under a distinct disadvantage vince lombardi once expressed his disdain for the forward pass as a simple matter of percentages when you lofted the pigskin downfield he reasoned three things could happen and two of them an interception or an incompletion were bad likewise in a series that has thus far been defined by how each team reacts when they hoist their spinnakers for the downwind legs several scenarios have transpired when the so called kites went skyward and many of them have had disastrous consequences botched takedowns questionable tactics exploding fabric all three snafus have turned the tide in this maddeningly close series where one mistake has often been one too many the italians have a weapon in their arsenal however that in most situations give them an upper hand on the downwind legs a super strong cloth from which their spinnakers are constructed called cuben fiber the fabric a high tech composite weave of spectra and mylar materials took its name from bill koch 's america cubed syndicate which developed the fabric during its winning america 's cup defense in 1992 it 's tough versatile and expensive and it gives the italians not only a deep sense of reassurance but a tactical edge as well comparatively speaking cayard 's spinnakers he carries two types some of which are built of nylon some of polyester are to cuben fiber what paper towels are to terry cloth the proof has been underscored time and again during the nearly four month long qualifying series in that span the italians have torn one or two spinnakers the americans have gone through at least eight including three thus far in the finals tactically cuben fiber gives the italians the ability to sail higher angles to the breeze when sailing downwind knowing that if the americans follow they stand a good chance of blowing out their sail because of the increased pressure and if the sail goes all too often the chances of victory go as well moreover the italians have cornered the current market on cuben fiber cayard could n't get his hands on the magic material even if he could afford it my understanding of it is that for their heavy spinnakers they 've got basically exclusive access to it he said their kites cost around sixty or seventy grand each he added they bought all the production of that cloth for this period even though it 's probably more than they need they just basically took it out of action cayard 's spinnakers cost about a third of those built from cuben fiber but prada skipper francesco de angelis feels his sails are a bargain it 's expensive sure he laughed but if you can save by buying one instead of six or seven it 's better the americans got the last laugh in race 6 however when the italians botched a spinnaker takedown at a critical moment for the second straight race and the sail wrapped around the rudder giving cayard his critical opening in a wild comeback victory which completed a surge from a 3 1 deficit they finally ripped a bulletproof 70000 spinnaker he said and the bad news for them is that when one of those spinnakers gets wrapped around the rudder they do n't come off ours would fall off like toilet paper cayard was also grinning when he made that observation but if the weathermen call for more breeze and the forecast says they will america one 's supporters will continue to hold their collective breath when their crew 's spinnakers are hauled aloft and snap full in the gusty air yacht racing
 a combination of factors makes north korea uniquely dangerous it has an unpredictable and untrustworthy dictator an economy in free fall and a two track nuclear weapons effort that appears more advanced than iraq 's one of those tracks a secret uranium enrichment program was uncovered in october the other built around plutonium reprocessed from spent reactor fuel has been closed since 1994 by agreement with the united states now it seems about to be reopened on thursday pyongyang announced that it was immediately reactivating a sealed power reactor that could produce one to two bombs worth of weapons grade plutonium per year this development requires an energetic diplomatic response from the bush administration the joint declaration on friday by mr bush and south korea 's president that the north 's actions are unacceptable is accurate but not enough washington seems to think that it can afford the luxury of deferring the north korean problem until it has finished disarming iraq it can not the starting point must be diplomacy military action would risk a violent north korean response that could be ruinous to south korea it could also endanger japan and the 100000 american troops currently based in northeast asia diplomacy coercive enough to work is hampered by the stubborn unwillingness of most of north korea 's neighbors to consider tough sanctions these obstacles must somehow be overcome and there is little time to lose restarting the reactor is bad enough what would be even more alarming would be ending the current international monitoring of north korea 's spent fuel and of a nearby plutonium reprocessing plant the international atomic energy agency is working hard to keep those monitors in place to succeed it must have the united states wholehearted support north korea claims that it needs the power reactor to replace electricity lost when the united states and other countries recently suspended fuel oil shipments because of the enriched uranium deception sending the international monitors home and allowing plutonium reprocessing to resume would leave no doubt that nuclear weapons production was north korea 's real and only agenda the white house must now mobilize an all out diplomatic effort to prevent that next step from being taken enlisting as much help as it can get from russia and china the two countries with the greatest influence in pyongyang if north korea is not compelled to change course and abandon both of its nuclear weapons tracks it could soon be producing several nuclear bombs a year it currently has long range missiles that threaten japan and might one day be upgraded to reach parts of the united states the world is a complicated place with multiple dangers and the united states can not always choose to deal with them in sequential order at best the iraq crisis will not be resolved for many more months dealing with the north korean weapons threat can not wait that long the danger is too grave and immediate

 following are excerpts from a news conference yesterday by secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld and gen richard b myers chairman of the joint chiefs of staff as recorded by federal document clearing house inc a complete transcript is online at nytimescom international mr rumsfeld as the coalition continues to close on baghdad there likely will be difficult days ahead but the regime is under increasing pressure their republican guard forces are being defeated by coalition airstrikes and by effective ground engagements some units are laying down their arms and surrendering to coalition forces wisely choosing not to die fighting for a doomed regime the regime has been forced to backfill its baghdad defenses with regular army units forces that they have historically considered less reliable which is a sign that they know they 're in difficulty while coalition forces have taken extraordinary measures to protect innocent civilians in this war saddam hussein has sent death squads to massacre innocent iraqi muslims indeed saddam hussein has killed more muslim people than perhaps any living person on the face of the earth the day is fast approaching when his murderous rule will end questions and answers q mr secretary you referred to some of the republican guard forces laying down arms can you tell us whether some of them have actually been withdrawn deliberately back into the city limits mr rumsfeld my impression is that it 's all of the above that some forces have in fact retreated into cities others have just left and gone home still others have surrendered still others are still there fighting and have been reinforced both with remnants of other republican guard units and also regular army forces q mr secretary you said a moment ago that iraq is running out of real soldiers and that all will be left are war criminals is that a warning that if these military leaders do n't give up now that they 'll be considered war criminals or is that an appeal to surrender mr rumsfeld i guess it 's a reflection of what 's taking place there there are any number of soldiers that are behaving as soldiers and they have been either surrendering being captured or being killed or they 're still there fighting there are others who have left and gone into a different mode where they are in civilian clothes and they are operating out of cities and they are putting themselves in close proximity of schools hospitals mosques and the like and conducting themselves less as soldiers and more as war criminals q what can you tell us about what it appears the special republican guard and the other security organizations around saddam hussein appear to be doing in baghdad now as it seems that the arrival of american forces is imminent mr rumsfeld they have conducted exercises over recent months and have block captains and they have dug trenches to put oil in to burn things they have done a variety of things that suggest that they anticipate that they could end up in the city of baghdad and they 've had various perimeter defenses q we 've heard a lot from people at the podium about securing the southern oil fields but not very much about what 's going on in the north to try to secure those fields mr rumsfeld we have to assume that they 've been wired with explosives as some were in the south we also would like very much to get in there and be able to assure that they are not damaged and cause a major environmental problem and general franks has ways of doing that at the right time q general myers i wanted to take you back to the whole issue of urban conflict can you give the public a sense of how the us has advanced from the days of you may think of the battle of hue in vietnam or stalingrad there 's these images of apocalyptic urban conflict general myers first of all you never know i mean how it 's going to go out the tactical situation could be very different from what we suppose and so i mean you 're just going to have to be ready for lots of things but you 've got a city of baghdad you 've got about five million residents half of whom are shia that have been persecuted by the regime probably will not be friendly to the regime they 're basically on the eastern half of the city you could assume that they might be helpful when you get to the point where baghdad is basically isolated then what is the situation you have in the country you have a country that baghdad no longer controls that whatever 's happening inside baghdad is almost irrelevant compared to what 's going on in the rest of the country what 's going on in the rest of the country well you have the southern oil fields we 'll see about the north you have the face now by this time probably of an iraqi interim administration some form of people standing up now starting to work the postconflict governance it 'll take some time but you 'll have that you 're going to have half the population that probably wants nothing to do with the folks the regime and then you 'll start working at it as you can but one of the things you can do is be patient about that so this notion of a siege and so forth i think is not the right mental picture q mr secretary do you have any information that would lead you to believe that a third party perhaps a foreign government such as france or russia might be encouraging what 's left of saddam 's regime to just hang on in hopes of cutting some kind of a deal and is there any deal available to them short of their end mr rumsfeld the answer 's yes and no there 's no question but that some governments are discussing from time to time some sort of a cutting a deal and the inevitable effect of it let there be no doubt is to give hope and comfort to the saddam hussein regime and give them ammunition that they can then try to use to retain the loyalty of their forces with hope that one more time maybe he 'll survive one more time maybe he 'll be there for another decade or so for another 17 or 18 un resolutions and as to the second question there 's not a chance that there 's going to be a deal it does n't matter who proposes it there will not be one q mr secretary i presume you 're pleased but are you also puzzled by the fact that the iraqis have n't used any chemical or biological weapons mr rumsfeld we 've always believed that the chances of their being used increase the closer that coalition forces got to baghdad i suspect that the regime has a dilemma if on the one hand they are holding out hope with their people that there might be a deal cut the use of chemical weapons would certainly end that prospect and that being the case they have to be balancing that do they want to not use all their weapons and hope that they can get a deal when it 's not even a remote possibility or will they go ahead and use them and totally eliminate the perception in their people that he might survive because once he uses those it 's pretty clear there ca n't be a deal so that 's the dilemma i suspect he faces q and is there a special military response to a chemical weapons attack mr rumsfeld we 've allowed as how we thought that they 'd best not use those weapons and i do n't want to go beyond that

 in a war with iraq the air force would use the same missile firing drones that killed one of al qaeda 's senior leaders in yemen to attack iraqi air defense radars mobile scud missile launchers and possibly sensitive targets in baghdad military officials said today in afghanistan the air force flew unarmed predator planes mostly for reconnaissance missions or to designate targets for piloted bombers the central intelligence agency used armed predators extensively there to attack suspected qaeda leaders and expanded its killer drone operations beyond afghanistan for the first time on sunday blasting qaed salim sinan al harethi and five associates in yemen about a month ago the air force began patrolling the skies over iraq 's southern no flight zone with remote controlled predators armed with two hellfires an air to ground laser guided weapon used effectively by apache helicopter gunships against iraqi tanks in the 1991 persian gulf war the armed predators have so far fired three or four missiles at iraqi targets including radar dishes air force officials said today the total number of missiles fired by cia and military drones in afghanistan and iraq is classified but officials put the number at 70 to 80 on targets it 's effective gen richard b myers chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said last month the predator an ungainly propeller driven craft that flies as slowly as 80 miles per hour and is guided by an operator at a television monitor hundreds of miles away has proved a formidable weapon in the campaign against terror last november a predator operated by the cia was used to coordinate a strike in which one of osama bin laden 's closest lieutenants muhammad atef was killed in kabul with its ability to loiter continuously for 24 hours or more at 15000 feet above the battlefield the predator can send live video to ac 130 gunships or command posts around the world without putting american pilots at risk its radar infrared sensors and color video camera can track vehicles at night and through clouds the video is sharp enough to make out people on the ground from more than three miles away the real advantage of course that the predator brings armed or unarmed is the fact that it 's persistent general myers said it 's over the target area for long periods of time and it can move between targets in any offensive against iraq the air force would probably use a combination of armed and unarmed predators flying from ali al salem air base in kuwait military officials said today the predators flying over afghanistan have operated from an air base in jacobabad pakistan armed predators could play a role in locating saddam hussein 's mobile biological weapons laboratories or destroying targets in baghdad that could be too risky for piloted aircraft the capability of using unmanned combat vehicles particularly with weapons that can be precisely delivered over heavily defended areas obviously yields some operational advantages said an air force official the air force has about 50 predators but only a handful are equipped to launch the hellfire missiles that pack a 14 pound custom designed charge of blast fragment explosives the cia has a small undetermined number of armed drones newer versions of the predator made by general atomics aeronautical systems inc of san diego at 45 million apiece are rolling off the production lines at the rate of about two aircraft a month air force officials said today the predators are not without shortcomings like any small plane they can not fly in stormy weather and have been prone to icing the plane also can be vulnerable to enemy antiaircraft fire at least nine air force predators and one cia drone have crashed during missions involving afghanistan or iraq since the sept 11 terrorist attacks the predator 's major combat debut came in 1995 over bosnia where it provided sharp images of the battlefield in what the military calls real time a year before the sept 11 attacks unarmed cia drones captured on video a tall turban wearing man in afghanistan that many intelligence officials believed was mr bin laden but the predators were not equipped to fire missiles the use of the armed predator in counterterrorism was years in the making coming only after settlement of a long running argument between the military and cia over who should have ultimate authority for firing its missiles that disagreement officials said persisted in the months before sept 11 and was resolved only after a predator missed a chance on the first night of the afghan war to attack a convoy that some said included mullah muhammad omar the taliban leader the understanding reached after that missed opportunity gave the cia for the first time the authority to strike beyond a narrow range of counterterrorism targets

 a smoky five alarm fire that burned for more than 12 hours on a commercial strip in brownsville brooklyn left a firefighter critically injured yesterday badly damaged six stores and dealt a blow to the commercial heart of a resurgent neighborhood the firefighter robert petrarca 26 got lost in the thick smoke in the cellar of a foot locker shoe store at 1636 pitkin avenue when he went downstairs to try to find the source of the fire shortly after it started tuesday night fire officials said he ran out of oxygen and it took his colleagues five minutes to find him and by then he had suffered severe smoke inhalation said deputy chief dan butler after that the fire department decided to fight the fire from the outside chief butler said that along with the volume of flammable inventory in the stores was why it burned for so long chief butler said it took a little bit longer but it involves less risk he said noting that the stores were closed at the time of the fire he said there were no lives at stake in the building so why take chances firefighter petrarca of ladder 120 in brownsville was treated in the hyperbaric chamber at brookdale university hospital and medical center according to fire officials and was in critical but stable condition last night the hospital said the cause of the fire which started around 10 pm tuesday and damaged a jewelry store a beauty supply store a jamaican restaurant a clothing store and the district offices of united states representative major r owens and state senator william f boyland jr was still under investigation i was here when they used to burn them down every night said james a bowens the chairman of the local community board nowadays in brownsville it 's build build build and when you see seven or eight businesses burning down and engulfed in flames when you 're trying to rebuild it hits you in your gut norman rappaport the owner of a building that houses four of the stores a two story brick structure built in the early 1900 's called the fire sickening mohammed anwar 's bina drugstore had survived the crime ridden 1980 's and the opening of a rite aid across the street in 1997 when the neighborhood was coming back it 's so hard to come here and build something up he said it takes so much time and now in just a few hours everything is gone mr anwar said he did not know if he would be able to rebuild on one side of mr anwar 's store mannequin heads spilled out of the bp hair classique store into an eerie pile in the street on the other side iqbal chhabra the owner of a store called perfect men was shoving around a sodden mass of winter hats and sunglasses when i first came here there were just burned out buildings said mr chhabra who opened his store 18 years ago but i 've seen things change they 've built beautiful houses name brand stores are moving in i feel sad about this the exterior of mr rappaport 's building did not appear too badly damaged and he said he was hopeful he would be able to rebuild former state senator william f boyland sr whose son just took over his seat in a special election held last week vowed that the block would come back soon we 're going to rebuild he said i 'm not talking about six or seven years i 'm talking about a matter of months
 gov jesse ventura of minnesota as everyone knows used to be a professional wrestler a job in which the athletes change their persona constantly the heroic champion on monday may be a masked demon on wednesday so this week when mr ventura announced he would not run for a second term it was easy to wonder if he was just preparing to morph into a new identity the governor who once famously called organized religion a sham and a crutch for weak minded people has never really tried life as a compassionate conservative there 's still time governors almost never become household names unless they decide to run for president mario cuomo thought about running for president so long that he became a sort of honorary candidate but jesse ventura was a national celebrity from the moment he won office in 1998 with 37 percent of the vote in a three way race his victory was seen as a sign that voters were bored with regular politicians what never occurred to anyone is that an entertainer like mr ventura might find politics boring too certainly the state 's 2 billion deficit has taken some of the fun out of the game and the governor 's approval ratings are now in the low 40 's when the minneapolis paper reported that his son tyrel had been throwing rowdy parties in the governor 's mansion mr ventura threw in the towel citing a need to protect my family the story about tyrel which focused heavily on empty wine bottles did not actually contain revelations likely to crush the spirit of a 22 year old mr ventura may have simply discovered that while being a national celebrity is a lot of fun being a governor is a lot of fights over school budget formulas and what kind of job the ex highway commissioner deserves this year the legislature which has taken a bipartisan tactic of ignoring mr ventura overrode his veto and voted to use the state 's reserve funds to fill up the hole in the budget hoping things will improve by next year mr ventura now has decided that he does n't want to be around when next year arrives while the governor has made some peculiar choices during his term of office the stint as color commentator for xfl football comes to mind this sounds like smart career planning to us
 there is something of a mystery to israel 's new campaign to kill members and leaders of hamas a mystery that goes to the heart of the standoff with the palestinians why did n't israel do this a year ago or two years ago and if it was a bad idea then why is it a good idea now no one has very good answers the change in strategy exposes the profound shifts in the diplomatic and military terrain here over three years of conflict and the poverty of solutions for bringing it to an end for years israel has carried out targeted killings assassinations palestinians call them of militants from hamas the palestinians leading islamic militant group and other violent organizations but it largely left alone the groups political leaders as opposed to military leaders who prepare attacks israel isolated the top palestinian political leader yasir arafat last year trapping him in his ruined ramallah compound and threatening to deport him it claimed that his declared support of a two state solution and mealy condemnations of suicide bombings were cover for fomenting terrorism meanwhile it left untouched hamas leaders who openly advocated the destruction of israel and celebrated suicide bombings that has now changed in june israel wounded a top political leader of hamas abdel aziz rantisi with a missile strike in gaza then after a devastating hamas suicide bombing here on aug 19 it killed ismail abu shanab a political figure known as the leading hamas advocate of a temporary halt to attacks on israelis since then israel has killed five other hamas members israeli officials compare the new campaign to israel 's pursuit of all the palestinians involved in killing 11 israeli athletes at the 1972 munich olympics but why had israel not acted sooner against the hamas political leadership a top israeli security official said israel may simply have made a mistake further he said we were concerned that the reaction might be undesirable that the targeted killings could heighten hamas suicide attacks but he said israel was left with no other choice because the governing palestinian authority was doing nothing asked why israel had not taken this step against hamas sooner professor ariel merari of tel aviv university one of israel 's most eminent counterterrorist experts said i do n't have any answer but he said he had his doubts that the new policy would be effective in stopping terrorism he said there was no evidence that the campaign to kill those involved in the munich attack had any deterrent effect hamas he said was a popular movement primarily influenced by palestinian public opinion that 's the key to winning the struggle changing palestinian public opinion he said and i doubt that killing hamas leaders is a useful means toward that end for the first 18 months or so of the conflict israel 's approach to fighting hamas besides stopping terrorists in the act was to put pressure on the palestinian authority blocking financing and destroying offices while demanding that it confront terrorism but mr arafat the authority 's president never ordered decisive action and the authority began to collapse some of its officials said privately that they wished israel would act against the hamas leaders who they saw as their own direst political threat as the suicide bombings continued israel said more than a year ago that it had no choice but to seize back cities and towns that had been ceded to palestinian authority control under the oslo peace process accusing the authority of direct links to terrorism israel over the last year forbade palestinian security forces to operate in most of the region it said it was assuming full responsibility again for its own security conducting raids in the west bank and gaza prime minister ariel sharon said he was prepared to make painful concessions for peace including a palestinian state but that he had no palestinian partner willing to confront terror watching the israeli strategy unfold many palestinians concluded that israel 's true goal was to destroy not hamas but the palestinian authority they said mr sharon liked the image conferred on palestinian nationalism by hamas 's venomous political leaders at the same time they argued mr sharon regarded not hamas but the palestinian authority as the real strategic threat since unlike hamas it held out the realistic possibility of a palestinian state alongside israel the two state concept that hamas has never accepted from the start hamas cleverly took advantage of the israeli military campaign said imad falouji a palestinian official who is a former member of the group and retains close ties to it hamas he said in a recent conversation in gaza city did not want to risk its popularity by being seen as provoking civil conflict with a direct attack on the palestinian authority instead it had a strategy mr falouji calls the circle hamas would attack israel israel would attack the authority and the authority would have to suffer the attacks or comply with israeli demands and attack hamas making palestinians see it as the party engaging in civil conflict but no one can speak of hamas attacks on the pa mr falouji said hamas knows the circle only goes one way this circle was interrupted by the american backed peace plan the road map once israel accepted it and mr arafat 's mainstream fatah movement decided on a unilateral cease fire hamas had little choice but to play along palestinian analysts say otherwise hamas would have risked its popularity because palestinians might have seen it as the sole source of continuing violence and the obstacle to peace as the peace talks flagged hamas began testing its freedom to attack again saying it would conduct reprisals for israeli raids that killed militants the horrific suicide bombing in jerusalem on aug 19 in which six children died and many were wounded scrambled all strategic calculations palestinian authority officials said that they then acquired the political leverage to act against hamas but that israel undermined them by killing mr abu shanab less than two days later israeli officials said they had held back for those two days in hopes the palestinian authority would act but despaired yet there were not many dramatic reprisals left for israel it already controlled most of the west bank and the palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas and security minister muhammad dahlan had the bush administration 's support as alternatives to mr arafat that left and still leaves the hamas political leaders as a target to bolster israel 's deterrent threat and assure israelis that their government is acting it may be that hamas now will rethink its violent strategy or that the palestinian authority will at last risk acting against it and it may be that the violence will intensify professor merari said he initially expected the conflict to last only a few months but now can not guess when it will end it 's really sad he said but i think we 'll have to see more violence until both sides are ready
 hours after president bush agreed to make congress a partner in deciding whether to invade iraq members from both parties began gearing up the cumbersome legislative process to reach a decision at least six committees plan several weeks of hearings to determine whether an invasion is justified and would work and the airwaves will most likely be full of supporters and opponents through october legislative leaders said they might delay a vote until after the nov 7 midterm elections david firestone
 one palestinian was killed and at least five were wounded as israel troops traded sporadic gunfire with militants and searched for smuggling tunnels in the southern gaza strip for a second day on saturday late saturday night dozens of israeli tanks and armored troop carriers pulled out of the rafah refugee camp and it appeared that the main thrust of the operation was over altogether 8 palestinians were killed and more than 50 were wounded in the two days of clashes but an israeli military official said some troops would remain in the area of rafah which is next to the border with egypt in the west bank city of ramallah yasir arafat the palestinian leader held talks with his new prime minister ahmed qurei and senior leaders in their fatah movement but were unable to settle internal political disputes over the new cabinet headed by mr qurei palestinian officials said saturday night mr arafat is facing criticism from several quarters and a quick resolution appeared unlikely the palestinian political turmoil the almost daily violence and a stepped up israeli military presence in palestinian areas have all added to an atmosphere of instability in recent days the israeli incursion into the rafah refugee camp was the biggest army operation in the coastal territory in months israeli troops on saturday shot dead a 19 year old palestinian zaki al sharif and five more palestinians were wounded a representative of najar hospital said it was not immediately clear whether mr sharif was involved in the fighting after heavy shooting exchanges in the early hours of friday the gunfire was intermittent on saturday both israelis and palestinians said the military said saturday that it had uncovered a third tunnel used to smuggle weapons in rafah the tunnel included an elaborate system of wheels and ropes that could be operated electronically allowing large quantities of weapons to be transferred into rafah from the egyptian side of the border the tunnel had an intercom system the military added during the last three years israel has found more than 70 tunnels beneath rafah 's sandy soil and about half of those were uncovered this year the military said rafah has a long history as a smugglers haven that predates the current conflict in a front line area in rafah that has been the scene of heavy fighting israeli soldiers ordered palestinians to evacuate their homes on saturday palestinian witnesses said the israelis said that they had torn down several uninhabited buildings that palestinian gunmen were using for cover and that houses linked to the smuggling tunnels were also being destroyed palestinians meanwhile said more than a dozen houses had been demolished or badly damaged in the latest israeli raid palestinians in southern gaza fired three mortars shells into the neighboring jewish settlement of gush katif damaging one home but causing no injuries the israeli military said mr arafat is facing broad opposition after his decision last sunday to establish an emergency palestinian government by decree mr arafat and mr qurei have quarreled over the question of how much authority the new government will have over the security forces which mr arafat has controlled when mr qurei 's cabinet was sworn in on tuesday nasser yousef the interior minister and the man responsible for the security forces did not attend several palestinian officials have said mr yousef an associate of mr arafat for decades wanted more authority before assuming the post many palestinian legislators are upset that they were not allowed to hold a debate and a vote of confidence on the new government a thursday session was postponed and the legislators say they intend to convene in the coming week to express their reservations about the new government
 the miranda warning that staple of late night cop shows has been under attack from right wing lawyers who say that informing suspects of their rights makes it too hard to get convictions yesterday the supreme court agreed to take a missouri case that could scale back the effectiveness of miranda warnings at issue is a two step form of questioning which missouri 's highest court called an end run around miranda the supreme court should hold that such interrogation violates the fifth amendment 's protection against self incrimination in miranda v arizona the 1966 landmark decision the supreme court held that suspects must be warned that they have the right to remain silent and to get legal representation before the police can question them in the decades since then miranda has worked well and has won support from law enforcement but some ultraconservatives eager to reverse what they perceive to be the liberal excesses of the 1960 's and 1970 's have tried to undo it the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit in richmond va the most conservative federal appeals court held in 1999 that miranda warnings were not constitutionally required but the supreme court reversed that decision thereby reaffirming its commitment to miranda the missouri case the court took yesterday however would permit the miranda holding to be dangerously narrowed the case involves the interrogation of a woman suspected of arson when she was arrested an officer questioned her without giving her a miranda warning after she confessed he turned on a tape recorder told her of her right not to incriminate herself and referred to her previous incriminating statements the police admitted that they used this two step interrogation technique routinely in the hope of getting suspects to confess first without knowing their rights and then confess a second time in a form that would be usable in court the missouri supreme court rightly threw out the woman 's conviction there has been one case in 1985 in which the united states supreme court allowed statements to be admitted into evidence even though the questioning began before miranda warnings were given in that case however the failure to give the warnings was inadvertent the case the court took yesterday involves a deliberate policy of duping suspects into incriminating themselves before telling them their rights the supreme court should hold that such interrogation a form of investigative trickery is coercive and unconstitutional

 the peabody conservatory in baltimore is one of the country 's best music schools and like many institutions devoted to preparing musicians for professional careers it periodically thrusts them into the public spotlight on wednesday evening the peabody symphony orchestra led by its music director hajime teri murai presented a demanding program that focused on two of the school 's graduates who have done well michael nathaniel hersch a composer who at 29 has attracted considerable attention in the last few years and the guitarist manuel barrueco who studied at peabody in the 1970 's and is now a member of the school 's faculty mr hersch 's vivid dark textured ashes of memory 1999 was the program 's principal attraction the work was composed for the pittsburgh symphony orchestra which performed it at carnegie hall in march but because the pittsburgh concert unaccountably offered only the second of the work 's two movements the peabody performance was the new york premiere of the entire 20 minute score and one thing this complete reading showed was how little sense it made to play only the finale since most of the central episodes in that movement are derived from materials introduced in the first like other works of mr hersch 's that have been heard in new york ashes of memory speaks in a language whose gestures and broader structures are rooted in romanticism but that language has an edge and an inventiveness that keep the music from seeming like warmed over brahms it also makes hefty demands on every section of the orchestra and there were times when the peabody students momentarily faltered still they conveyed the almost visual imagery of mr hersch 's gradually unfolding themes with a clarity and directness that served the music well mr barrueco 's contribution was a precise smoothly flowing account of rodrigo 's popular concierto de aranjuez for which mr murai and his players provided a properly supple support the orchestra also offered a robust sometimes clattery performance of verdi 's forza del destino overture and a vigorous if at times rough hewn reading of bartok 's miraculous mandarin suite
 meteorite mystery on the long transit from earth to moon the apollo spacecraft were put into what was known as barbecue mode a slow rotation so that no part of the ship got too hot from exposure to sunlight a rock in space like a fragment knocked off one asteroid in a collision with another in the belt between mars and jupiter does not normally roll like a rack of ribs on a rotisserie spit so one side gets more sunlight than the other and gives off more heat in return this difference the russian engineer i o yarkovsky suggested a century ago can be enough to cause the rock to drift slightly in its orbit scientists in italy and the czech republic have now used this yarkovsky effect to explain one of the remaining mysteries of how some of those asteroid fragments travel all the way to earth where they become meteorites it has long been known that asteroid fragments in two narrow orbital bands can under the gravitational effects of jupiter and saturn be kicked out of the asteroid belt and head toward earth but this supposes that only a few asteroids situated on the edges of these bands which are known as resonance gaps produce the fragments and the numbers do not add up a few asteroids are not enough to produce the number of fragments that hit earth using computer modeling the scientists found an explanation in the yarkovsky effect a fragment from a far off asteroid they reported in the journal nature can slowly drift into one of the resonance gaps due to the differential heating enough of these rocks can drift in this way to explain the number of meteorites hitting earth and the phenomenon also explains the age of many meteorites as measured by cosmic ray exposure they have been drifting for millions of years before entering the resonance gap rather than quickly entering from nearby 'a space odyssey rerun nasa 's promised rethinking of its faster cheaper better strategy for exploring mars instituted after the loss of two spacecraft last year has already brought some changes in the way the agency is pursuing future missions the most notable being a total review of all missions in the works which has resulted in delays and cancellations for some but in addition to rethinking nasa has been engaged in some renaming never one to pass up a chance to increase the appeal of its projects to the general public the agency announced last week that the mission formerly known as mars surveyor 2001 would now be known as 2001 mars odyssey in honor of the book and film 2001 a space odyssey the renaming follows a decision in may amid all the rethinking to eliminate a lander portion of the mission the 2001 mars odyssey will now consist only of an orbiter to be launched next april it will carry instruments to detect the planet 's surface composition any water or shallow buried ice and radiation nasa has since announced a plan to send two landers to mars in 2003 a gold rush legacy the california gold rush may be long over but the environmental and ecological effects remain more than 150 years after james marshall first found flakes of gold at sutter 's mill the latest evidence for this is a study by scientists with the united states geological survey of mercury contamination of fish in the sierra nevadas mercury is a potent neurotoxin and it accumulates in the food chain during the gold rush millions of pounds of mercury were used to extract gold from its ore it is still used this way in some developing countries much of the mercury was lost to the environment the federal researchers found that bass and other fish from two watersheds in former gold mining areas showed significant levels of mercury in their tissues the researchers have given their data to state health officials who can decide whether to issue a public advisory against eating certain fish from these areas
 lebanon 's border with israel was quiet today as the lebanese army and local palestinian officials confined angry palestinian protests to their refugee camps although renewed clashes along the border were widely expected after the outburst of violence on thursday between israelis and palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip beefed up army checkpoints along the coast road and camp leaders orders kept away protesters this is important and significant said a high ranking official with the united nations peacekeeping force in southern lebanon this is the first time they have actually prevented demonstrations on the border once people reach the border it can get out of control at the crossing here where on saturday 2 palestinian protesters were killed and 24 wounded as they threw stones and a gasoline bomb over the fence at israeli troops the only people in sight were a handful of television camera operators and journalists on a bluff near the gate waiting for something to happen also in the area were lebanese army intelligence officers in a black mercedes benz bristling with radio antennas and a casually dressed squad of young men who said they were security for hezbollah the islamic military group that seized three israeli soldiers last week no israeli patrols were moving on their perimeter road below an israeli blimp dangling a television camera floated overhead to survey the scene lebanon has been under intense international pressure to deploy its army along the border a demand made most recently by united nations secretary general kofi annan on a visit on thursday to president emile lahoud the government here has repeatedly insisted that it will not be a border guard for israel mr lahoud was reported to have told mr annan this is a final and irrevocable position a series of behind the scenes contacts has been aimed at keeping the border calm avoiding israeli reprisals although no lebanese soldiers were seen along the border today there was a highly visible buildup on the coast road between sidon and tyre that was clearly intended to prevent groups from traveling to the border for demonstrations armored personnel carriers clustered around traffic circles and the checkpoints were stopping only southbound vehicles creating a backup groups of palestinian protesters from camps near tripoli in northern lebanon were reported to have been turned back at army roadblocks the ain el hilwe camp in sidon as with most camps saw emotional demonstrations but a human chain of palestinian officials kept the demonstrators from trying to go past the camp gates most of the palestinian camps here are encircled by the lebanese army which syria ultimately in large part directs although the camps have arms caches palestinians are kept under tight surveillance in reaction to the days of the civil war here when they formed a state within a state at the rashidiye camp near tyre lebanese soldiers meticulously searched every departing vehicle in rashidiye the fatah commander for lebanon sultan abu alaynen who despite being under an apparently somewhat technical lebanese death sentence works from an office suite surrounded by heavily armed guards he said there were no plans at this point to mount border demonstrations or operations into israel these days we are doing our best not to let things get out of control in southern lebanon he said but he added palestinians trying to strike out on their own had been caught by lebanese officials as they tried to approach the border the leading newspaper an nahar reported this morning that lebanese security had intercepted an armed squad of palestinians overnight that had been headed for the border from a refugee camp near tyre but gave no further details we are playing in a very dangerous game here a spokesman for the united nations force timor goksel said all we need is one man with a kalishnikov or an rpg a rocket propelled grenade and we have a disaster on our hands

 to the editor could everyone in the bush administration please take a deep breath before commencing a military assault on iraq front page july 5 why the president 's people have publicly asserted their belligerent intentions toward saddam hussein is beyond comprehension every time they hurl their invectives at him they thereby empower not weaken the dictator if the united states is afraid of him why should leaders of other nations not respect his formidability moreover it seems to me the greater the threat we express toward him the more we are likely to confirm the fears of the iraqi people that we are the enemy and not him before thousands of lives are lost could n't we just talk to the iraqis harvard hollenberg new york july 5 2002
 uncle tungsten memories of a chemical boyhood by oliver sacks illustrated 337 pages alfred a knopf 25 the son of two physicians in wartime england oliver sacks says it was understood almost from my birth that i would be a doctor and in fact he would grow up to become a doctor a humane philosophical doctor uncommonly attuned to the passion and pathos of his patients and the astonishing resilience of human life as his earlier books awakenings an anthropologist on mars the man who mistook his wife for a hat so eloquently attest dr sacks 's first love however was not medicine but chemistry and in his new memoir uncle tungsten he gives us a moving account of his childhood ardor for science for numbers for the chemical elements for formulas and systems science offered this shy young boy bullied and abused at school and rocked by the convulsions of world war ii a kind a refuge it offered him the promise of stability and order in an unstable world no one better conveys the romance of science than mr sacks in these pages he not only communicates his own boyhood fascination with the magical realm of chemistry with the mysterious qualities of the different elements their resonant names and pungent smells and colors but he also leaves us with an appreciation of the beauty and economy of the natural world the mathematical workings as he puts it of god 's abacus the periodic table was incredibly beautiful the most beautiful thing i had ever seen mr sacks writes of the table of the elements first glimpsed by him in 1945 at the science museum in south kensington london i could never adequately analyze what i meant here by beauty simplicity coherence rhythm inevitability or was it the symmetry the comprehensiveness of every element firmly locked into its place with no gaps no exceptions everything implying everything else the periodic table like other scientific breakthroughs also gave the young mr sacks intimations of the transcendent power of the human mind and the fact that it might be equipped to discover or decipher the deepest secrets of nature to read the mind of god he developed a keen admiration for dmitri mendeleev the genius behind the periodic table and a deep sense of identification with the early 19th century poet chemist humphry davy whose scientific enthusiasm and dangerous impulsiveness so closely mirrored his own with the encouragement of his uncle dave or uncle tungsten as he was known because he manufactured light bulbs with filaments of fine tungsten wire and uncle abe his physics uncle the young oliver began an apprenticeship in science at an early age he spent hours searching for prime numbers memorizing them playing with them in his head later he tried to replicate famous experiments in chemistry and physics spending nights and weekends in a makeshift laboratory set up in his parents house mr sacks speculates that he sought out the special dangers of chemistry and many of his experiments were dangerous given the easy accessibility during his childhood of volatile and even toxic chemicals as a means of playing with such fears persuading myself that by care and vigilance prudence forethought one could learn to control or find a way through this hazardous world already several events in his childhood had left him with a heightened sense of the precariousness of life at age 6 like many boys in london during the blitz he was sent away to a boarding school in the country there his fears of abandonment were made worse by the bullying of older boys and brutal beatings at the hands of a sadistic headmaster the experience robbed him of his faith in god and left him with a host of fears fears of crossing the street fears of other children fears of illnesses and death his older brother michael who also suffered severe beatings at school he writes would later become psychotic given to messianic fantasies or delusions to distance himself from michael 's madness and his fears that something similar would happen to him oliver immersed himself in the worlds of mineralogy and chemistry and physics in science focusing on them holding myself together in the chaos in a passage that hints at the wellsprings of mr sacks 's sympathetic understanding as a doctor he writes it was not that i was indifferent to michael i felt a passionate sympathy for him i half knew what he was going through but i had to keep a distance also create my own world from the neutrality and beauty of nature so that i would not be swept into the chaos the madness the seduction of his when mr sacks departs from the narrative of his childhood to serve up lengthy digressions on the finer points of rare earth metals or electromagnetic reactions his writing can lapse into textbook lecturing but even these dense scientific passages are enlivened by his boyish wonder at the amazing logic and strangeness of the world his descriptions of life in pre world war ii london and the subsequent changes in the postwar city are both sweet and sour animated in equal parts by nostalgia for a vanished era and aversion for the ordeals he suffered as a child by age 15 he observes his passion for chemistry had begun to fade the boy who had once identified with the inert gases those elements unable because of their chemical structure to form compounds began to hunger for the human the personal at the same time the nature of chemistry had begun to change as well the ad hoc hands on laboratory work of the 19th century giving way to a more theoretical brand of science informed by quantum mechanics but while mr sacks 's dreams of becoming a chemist slowly receded as he prepared to become a doctor he has managed to preserve in this affecting book that sweet interlude when he spent hours enchanted totally absorbed wandering making discoveries in the enchanted garden of mendeleev
 when the clock strikes midnight tomorrow dec 31 the current millennium will finally come to a close and a new one begin an event widely celebrated a year early when people around the world welcomed in 2000 but the arrival of jan 1 will also have a specific meaning within the history of christianity for 2001 will mark 1700 years since the faith 's establishment in armenia given that armenian communities can be found worldwide these days the celebration will not be confined to armenia alone this is an occasion for the armenians to remember the past and while remembering the past create a vision for the future said archbishop khajag barsamian head of the diocese of the armenian church in america whose headquarters are in manhattan one thing is very obvious the archbishop added in a recent telephone interview for 1700 years enlightened by the faith st gregory brought to armenia we are able not only to survive but also to have revival st gregory the illuminator was the early christian missionary who endured prolonged brutal imprisonment and then emerged sufficiently unshaken to convert the armenian king in ad 301 the king proclaimed christianity the state religion that was a conversion to which armenians can point with great pride because it preceded by more than a decade the conversion of the roman emperor constantine a crucial event in the development of the faith as the archbishop noted survival has been a pressing issue for armenians throughout their history especially in the 20th century during world war i hundreds of thousands of armenians living in what was then the ottoman empire now mostly turkey were killed by government soldiers or died of starvation when forcibly removed from their villages for more than seven decades after the war armenia endured as a state within the soviet union it finally emerged independent in 1991 recalling the events of world war i as they affected his own family archbishop barsamian said his grandmother then a young woman three months pregnant became a widow when her husband was taken away along with other men from their area never to be seen again can you imagine a young newly wedded girl having all the dreams of the future and then everything got dark the archbishop said but when he was growing up he added i did not see any bitterness in her just the contrary he said there was faith and in this profound faith there was this continuing life this is what we are celebrating the archbishop said and there is power there and that power is the power of god through human beings the interview with archbishop barsamian took place before he departed for armenia accompanied by two college age parishioners representing the faithful in the united states in armenia the three of them will join similar delegations from dioceses around the world for a ceremony led by his holiness karekin ii the supreme patriarch and catholicos of the armenian orthodox church tomorrow the catholicos will go to khor virab where st gregory was imprisoned and light a torch at midnight then he will travel in procession to etchmiadzin the center of the armenian church for a ceremony in which he will light a lantern on an altar and that light will be shared with the delegations from around the world each of which will have brought its own lantern after a civic ceremony in the armenian capital yerevan the delegations will return home where a second set of religious ceremonies will be held in a symbolic act of spreading st gregory 's light the message of conversion and faith throughout the armenian diaspora in new york the ceremony will take place at st vartan cathedral on second avenue at 34th street on sunday jan 7 there will be a special service with young people from each of our parishes archbishop barsamian said at its conclusion a lantern will be given to representatives from each parish a young man and a young woman who will take it back to their home church in those churches the light will be available to the families of parishioners who want to light their own lanterns and take them home i hope and i pray the archbishop said that this whole celebration will create a new era in the life of the armenian people correction january 5 2001 friday the religion journal column on saturday about commemorations of 1700 years of christianity in armenia misstated the date of a service at st vartan cathedral in new york on second avenue at 34th street it is 10 30 am tomorrow not sunday
 gov donald siegelman said the state might have to build a new prison and consider alternative sentencing programs to ease a prison overcrowding crisis at a news conference the governor raised the possibility of creating drug courts as many states have to funnel those convicted of drug related crimes into other facilities and said the state would review its pardon and parole procedures he said he did not know how the state would respond to a court order last week requiring the prison system to accept nearly 2000 prisoners backed up into county jails in a month but he said a first step would quickly create 300 new beds in the prisons david firestone nyt

 sultan muhammad faizi was relaxing over a meal of bread and spinach in the control tower of kabul international airport when his radio crackled to life a united states government plane was arriving from tajikistan and needed directions on how to land it is no easy proposition to land a plane at this ruined airfield the main gateway to afghanistan is a gantlet ringed by mines pocked by bomb craters and littered with the charred hulks of destroyed aircraft you 'll have to land on the taxiway mr faizi instructed the pilots on monday after padding barefoot over to the radio the runway is not usable turning to a visitor he said there was no place in the world where they let planes land on a taxiway which in kabul is much narrower than the runway not to mention curved but what can we do six american bombs rained on kabul airport 's runway during the united states led bombing campaign in october leaving yawning craters in the tarmac several others landed on the taxiway and apron one bomb still unexploded is buried under a fleet of jets owned by the state carrier ariana airlines for all that kabul is determined to have its airport back in business since last month bomb clearing teams have been combing the runway and adjacent fields digging up nearly 2000 unexploded bombs this dangerous work has enabled the airport to start a twice weekly commercial flight between here and the western afghanistan city of herat it also takes off and lands on the taxiway in three or four days the airport authorities said kabul will be able to reopen its runway to larger jets everybody is determined to help afghanistan reclaim its national airport lakhdar brahimi the united nations special envoy to afghanistan said after a tour of the mine clearing operations on monday mr brahimi said that fully reopening the airport which had been closed since fall would help relief efforts the united nations has had to use a military air base at bagram about 30 miles north of kabul which makes bringing in food and other supplies cumbersome reopening kabul airport would also restore a semblance of normality to afghanistan 's capital nearly two months after northern alliance troops drove the taliban out of the capital it remains largely cut off from the world land routes are hazardous because of bandits while bagram is accessible only to military planes and flights organized by the united nations many people after five years want to come back to kabul said ghulam ali timar the airport general manager who took over after the taliban fled the reopening of the airport means that kabul is safe kabul of course is far from safe and judging by the extent of the devastation at the airport regular operations are likely to be weeks if not months away beyond the damage from the recent bombs kabul airport has been a battleground ever since the soviet occupation of afghanistan like everything here it is also impoverished mr ghulam said he had no fire trucks no weather monitoring equipment and no snowplows crucial for an airport in a place where winters can be severe he also has no radio transmitter to communicate with commercial flights from outside the country it was ripped out of the air traffic control center in the chaos of the bombing raids somebody took it i do n't know who it was mr ghulam said with a shrug but we are starting from zero the united nations had offered to help the airport obtain new radio equipment but before any international commercial flights can arrive the afghan interim government must negotiate with the united states to reopen large parts of afghanistan 's airspace with american warplanes still bombing suspected al qaeda redoubts in eastern afghanistan that seems unlikely to happen soon meantime the airport is being held together with wire and glue the united states replaced windows in the control tower that were blown out when two american bombs landed near the terminal a rocket crashed into the offices of ariana airlines two floors below narrowly missing the tower on the runway more than 100 mine clearing experts are using bomb detectors bomb sniffing dogs and their eyes to scour the airfield when they see a suspicious object they mark it with red paint the british military has supplied a heavily armored vehicle known as a flail which trundles up and down the runway pounding the asphalt with powerful hammers to set off mines and other explosives crews are filling the craters left by the bombs but the american plane that landed on monday had to swerve after touching down to avoid a particularly nasty pothole a team of mine clearers scurried across the taxiway just before it landed like pedestrians trying to beat a traffic light running a seat of the pants operation frustrates mr faizi who has worked for 39 years as an air traffic controller we used to be able to warn people on the ground about planes coming in he said noting that the ground communications system was also broken now i just stand here and watch them

 the triumphal mission accomplished banner was the pride of the white house advance team the image makers who set the stage for the president 's close ups on may 1 on a golden pacific evening aboard the carrier abraham lincoln they made sure that the banner was perfectly captured in the camera shots of president bush 's speech declaring major combat in iraq at an end but on tuesday in the rose garden mr bush publicly disavowed the banner that had come to symbolize what his critics said was a premature declaration that the united states had prevailed the 'mission accomplished sign of course was put up by the members of the uss abraham lincoln saying that their mission was accomplished mr bush told reporters i know it was attributed somehow to some ingenious advance man from my staff they were n't that ingenious by the way well yes and no after the news conference the white house press secretary scott mcclellan carefully elaborated on the president 's words the banner was suggested by those on the ship he said they asked us to do the production of the banner and we did they 're the ones who put it up the man responsible for the banner scott sforza a former abc producer now with the white house communications office was traveling overseas on tuesday and declined to answer questions he is known for the production of the sophisticated backdrops that appear behind mr bush with the white house message of the day like helping small business repeated over and over mr bush 's democratic competitors for president immediately pounced on his disavowal gen wesley k clark for one said that mr bush 's comments blaming the sailors for something his advance team staged were outrageous
 for two years the people of this danube river town kept the dark secret that has now led to the first move by serbia 's new democratic authorities to charge slobodan milosevic with war crimes it was april 6 1999 and yugoslavia was at war with nato which was bombing the country to stop mr milosevic who was then president of yugoslavia and his security forces from killing torturing and expelling the albanians of kosovo the police asked zivadin djordjevic 56 a professional diver with the local power station to check on a truck submerged in the danube he thought it was just another traffic accident nothing prepared him for the shock when they hoisted the truck ashore with a winch and he and a police technician opened the rear doors to find dozens of bodies tumbling out on top of them we barely opened the doors maybe a foot or two so it 's hard to describe he said arms and legs almost fell out because they were leaning against the door in that split second i noticed a half naked woman a child of 7 or 8 years old behind and an old man it was a mess of mangled bodies clothing mud and water the police took the bodies away blew up the truck and told mr djordjevic and others to keep quiet though word had already spread around town wartime constraints caused the subject to become taboo rapidly anti nato propaganda was at a height and a draconian information law was in force so that journalists lived in fear of their livelihoods and even their lives if they reported something deemed even remotely unpatriotic i knew about it and the public knew about it but no one dared to talk said mica aleksic a journalist and political activist in kladovo for what was then the opposition to mr milosevic residents suspected the bodies were those of civilians killed in kosovo but a veil of secrecy fell over the case he said we talked about it in private but no one could say anything publicly because everyone was afraid of the milosevic regime with mr milosevic in jail in belgrade since april 1 the story finally came out in the serbian newspapers this month it has quickly acquired enormous significance here because it has provided both the serbian people and the authorities with the most convincing evidence to date of war crimes committed in kosovo and of mr milosevic 's involvement in covering them up police officials directing the investigation said last week that they were bringing charges against mr milosevic for ordering officials to clean up in kosovo and remove evidence of civilian casualties that might be of interest to the international war crimes tribunal in the hague this is the first time that the authorities in serbia who arrested mr milosevic on charges of embezzlement and abuse of power have linked him to war crimes the hague tribunal indicted the former yugoslav leader during the kosovo war in may 1999 for atrocities in kosovo an indictment for crimes allegedly committed during the earlier wars in croatia and bosnia has yet to materialize police officials and serbia 's new interior minister dusan mihajlovic told a news conference last week that in a meeting in late march 1999 mr milosevic ordered his interior minister vlajko stojiljkovic who was also later indicted by the hague tribunal to remove civilian casualties in kosovo that could be the source for investigations by the tribunal toma fila mr milosevic 's lawyer has called the allegations ridiculous mr stojiljkovic has denied the incident but the information appears to have come from vlastimir djordjevic the former head of police public security who was at the meeting also present was rade markovic the former head of state security who is now in jail under investigation for murder and attempted murder of mr milosevic 's opponents the information has emerged just as the government is debating a law on cooperation with the hague tribunal that would establish the procedure for yugoslavia to transfer war crimes suspects to the court the bill is encountering opposition in the federal parliament from former allies of mr milosevic whose support is crucial to its passage but the government needs to pass the law before an aid conference on june 29 if it wants to ensure american participation in the conference and raise its goal of 1 billion on wednesday mr mihajlovic the serbian interior minister told a session of the serbian parliament that the truck had contained 86 bodies and said he would soon make public where the bodies had come from and what had been done with them he gave no details but hinted strongly that more evidence would turn up against mr milosevic and his security chiefs i would wish that this is the only such case we are facing now mr mihajlovic told parliament but there are a lot of indications that there are more similar cases for the people of kladovo there is little doubt that the deaths of people who were clearly civilians were the result of terrible deeds directed or committed by members of the milosevic regime nikola dajic 58 one of four workers ordered by the police to load the bodies on another truck under cover of darkness after their discovery said there were small children among them he said he presumed they were from kosovo because their injuries appeared to be from grenade explosions they were in pieces destroyed they were covered in mud and smelled very badly he said they came from a battlefield he added when asked why he thought they came from kosovo he replied where else do we have a war mr djordjevic the diver said the truck had no license plates but carried a sticker on the cab doors indicating it belonged to a kosovo company named progress based in the town of prizren the truck was discovered on april 6 1999 but mr djordjevic and mr dajic said the bodies were badly decomposed and could have been in the water nearly 20 days local journalists have found one person who claims to have seen someone sinking a truck into the danube farther upstream on the night of march 20 that would mean that the bodies were dumped before nato began its bombing campaign against yugoslavia on march 24 1999 at a time when yugoslav forces were escalating their offensive against albanian villages in kosovo local journalists have also said a police officer at the scene told them that some of the clothing indicated the people were kosovars people in kladovo said it was good that the case was finally out in the open and being investigated but some have called mr djordjevic a traitor and even blamed him for laying serbia open to accusations of genocide a confident barrel chested man he showed some lingering fear but he said he felt relief that the crime was finally being investigated it is not easy to carry something inside for two years he said
 october men reggie jackson george steinbrenner billy martin and the yankees miraculous finish in 1978 by roger kahn illustrated 382 pp orlando fla harcourt 25 the problem with most books that attempt to chronicle a baseball season is that they read like a whodunit after somebody has told you that the butler 's brother did it with slow acting poison because he was having an affair with the maid this subgenre of jocklit relies on the reader 's selective amnesia pages of manufactured suspense building up to a surprise ending already known to everyone with october men his account of the 1978 yankees roger kahn deftly avoids this common trap he knows that we know that the yankees will overcome all odds to catch the boston red sox and win the world series he takes advantage of our familiarity realizing that it gives him license to play with the story zooming in for a close up pulling back to show the big picture spinning hard against the conventional wisdom george steinbrenner al rosen billy martin and bob lemon this then was the foursome chained together at various times within the yankee command post a baseball equivalent of fort apache the bronx kahn writes each possessed star power and when they clashed significant portions of the cosmos seemed to shake that is one view anyway and the popular one a dissenting opinion goes like this after martin vaporized all you really had were three tough guys from cleveland trying to make it in new york kahn 's narrative follows the arc of this singular season but he does n't feel the need to stick too closely to the box scores with the self assurance of a master storyteller he veers off on a tangent about the reaction to the first female reporter appearing in the comiskey park press box what do you think this is ladies night at the turkish bath or a mini profile of the columnist dick young a kind of latter day aaron burr whose chosen weapons were sheets of yellow western union paper and a typewriter before returning to the pennant race if an anecdote ends with a great punch line that is reason enough to include it kahn recounts how lemon who managed the chicago white sox in 1978 before replacing martin in midseason complained to the umpires about the hailstorm of reggie bars being thrown onto the field by yankee fans after jackson hit a home run the stuff is slippery lemon deadpanned besides people are starving all over the world and we just had 30 billion calories laying all over the field october men also reveals the soft underbelly of the 1978 edition of the yankees taking us inside the clubhouse after the fearsome relief pitcher goose gossage made two consecutive errors to lose an early season game all but single handedly gossage wedged his large frame into his locker closed his eyes and began to cry kahn writes presently he rolled out of the locker onto the floor and curled into the fetal position his sobs carried through the clubhouse the core of the book is kahn 's portrayal of the team 's three alpha males the principal owner george steinbrenner the right fielder reggie jackson and the manager billy martin kahn goes beyond the easy stereotypes of these oh so public figures informing us that the blustering steinbrenner was in the williams college glee club with stephen sondheim i had a better voice steinbrenner volunteers and leaving us to decide whether or not steinbrenner was set up by richard nixon 's dirty tricks squad jackson is also shown as a man of many moods once provoking a fistfight with an oakland a 's teammate mike epstein over some free tickets then sidling up to him on the team plane saying it bothers me that you do n't like me while the portrait of martin is the least nuanced of the three kahn depicts him as a whitmanesque jumble of contradictions alfred manuel martin is sensitive and brash defiant and humble angry and soft voiced he writes he has not lived like a trappist monk but to picture him as an inveterate hell raiser completely surrounded by chorus girls comfortable only on ball fields and in saloons would be a considerable exercise in inaccuracy kahn sees baseball as a game of connections he is quick to point out the two degrees of separation between martin and casey stengel and john mcgraw john mcgraw 's great 1905 giant team despised him kahn writes i know that because christy mathewson told ring lardner who told his son john who told me though the team 's internal strife makes for great copy kahn is smart enough to emphasize that the bronx zoo yankees succeeded in spite of a dysfunctional clubhouse not because of it at the same time kahn understands that baseball does n't exist in a vacuum he weaves in references to the social and political events of the day arguing for example that new york 's newspaper strike was as important as red sox injuries in shaping this pennant race while most books about the yankees have been either hero worshiping or muckraking kahn 's perspective is refreshing while on some level the author of the boys of summer has to qualify as a yankee hater one can not love both the yankees and the brooklyn dodgers his enmity is well tempered he sees the yankees as an evil empire but it is an empire populated with good men who often rise above the team the yankees managed news in 1928 and 1953 as successfully as the yankees manage news and newspeople today kahn argues remarkably and uniquely 1978 comes down to us as the year in which yankee news management failed completely and a very rugged yankee baseball team did not not content merely to rehash the details of bucky dent 's home run october men instead sprawls like a great ballpark conversation encompassing the big and the small the old and the new the sacred and the profane kahn asks rhetorically what were these yankees anyway a big league team a commune an encounter group a street gang the answer of course is all of the above allen st john collaborated with christopher russo on the mad dog 100 the greatest sports arguments of all time
 locked in conflict fearing for their very existence as nations israelis and palestinians have for generations prized national unity deferring or papering over internal disputes about the means and ends of their struggles but before even hoping to end the conflict with each other each side must first face up to these conflicts within itself according to the iron logic of a new international peace plan today president bush secured commitments from ariel sharon the israeli prime minister and mahmoud abbas the palestinian prime minister to begin doing just that mr sharon promised to begin confronting the settler movement he nurtured for decades that means plunging into a long postponed national debate which mr sharon has tentatively begun over what israel wants from its occupation of the west bank and gaza strip which it captured in the 1967 war and where it has now settled 200000 of its citizens mr abbas promised to end the armed palestinian uprising and to permit only law enforcement officers to carry guns that means stopping the terrorists who have hijacked the palestinian national dream and shifting the internal palestinian conversation away from empathy for suicide bombers to horror at the killing to make peace in the middle east israelis and palestinians may have to come to the brink of what they fear could be civil conflict if they are sincere about seeing this process through each of the leaders here including president bush will have to take severe political tests and all of them will have to pass tonight in jerusalem thousands of settlers gathered to angrily protest today 's summit accusing their old ally mr sharon of surrendering to terrorism in the gaza strip leaders of hamas rejected mr abbas 's suggestion that they surrender their arms it seemed fitting that these men took this leadership challenge upon themselves in aqaba which translates as obstacle they met down the beach from the ruins of a fort captured in 1917 by lawrence of arabia during a previous attempt to reshape the middle east on each side of this triangular summit doubts weighed heavily about the depth of the others commitments palestinian officials fear that mr sharon 's talk of dismantling unauthorized outposts of settlements was meant merely to create political theater to generate an appearance of israeli sacrifice for peace without much cost to the settlement movement in recent years settlers have set up dozens of these makeshift outposts of trailers and tents on hilltops across the west bank sometimes populating them with only a handful of people if anyone yet evacuating any outpost is almost sure to generate searing images of settlers screaming at soldiers and perhaps even fighting with them as they have in the past then after a time the outposts can easily be set up again as they have been as an obstacle to a geographically contiguous palestinian state in the west bank these outposts pale beside giant settlements like ariel and ma'ale adumim with some 20000 residents or more or beside smaller but deeply rooted settlements like itamar near nablus those settlements are untouched so far by the peace plan the settlements are perfectly legitimate alan baker the legal adviser to the foreign ministry said drawing a distinction between them and the relatively few outposts that israel considers illegal during the 10 years of the oslo agreement which unlike this plan did not explicitly address settlements the population of the settlements doubled the new plan though calls for a freeze on settlement growth which mr sharon did not address today it was perhaps significant that mr sharon spoke in english not in hebrew israeli leaders have often accused palestinian leaders particularly yasir arafat of speaking in english and not arabic when they delivered messages that were popular with the americans but not necessarily with their own people yet at 75 mr sharon an architect of the settlement movement as a means of promoting israel 's security has unique credentials to question whether settlements now safeguard or endanger israel 's existence by perpetuating the occupation it is in israel 's interest not to govern the palestinians he said today a peaceful palestinian democracy he continued will promote the long term security and well being of israel as a jewish state like mr sharon mr abbas who spoke in arabic was careful to couch his endorsement of the peace plan not just in idealistic terms but in hard nosed language about his people 's national interests in renouncing terror against the israelis wherever they may be he said that such methods clashed with palestinians religious and moral traditions these methods also conflict with the kind of state we wish to build based on human rights and rule of law he said yet mr abbas 's remarks were not without a note of ambiguity even as he ruled out violence to deal with occupation he said that palestinians would be partners in the international war against occupation and terrorism according to the white house translation of his remarks after more than a month mr abbas 's oratory about stopping violence has yet to be put to the test mr abbas has been trying to negotiate a cease fire with hamas islamic jihad and other violent groups rather than to arrest those intent on violence and to confiscate arms mr abbas told mr bush today that it would take him a couple of more weeks to persuade hamas to agree to stop the violence palestinian officials said nabil shaath the palestinian foreign minister said that mr abbas could work only through persuasion because israeli raids had left him without police forces yet muhammad dahlan mr abbas 's security minister has thousands of armed men under this control mr abbas does not have nearly mr sharon 's domestic political strength but he has credibility as a warhorse of the mainstream fatah movement and as a palestinian refugee of the 1948 arab israeli war perhaps most important he has gained international legitimacy palestinian officials said tonight that they had achieved their chief goals for the summit reviving a relationship with the united states that has been all but dead for more than a year and gaining what they saw as a clear american commitment to the peace plan diplomats who know him say mr abbas understands he will lose this critical asset international credibility and support if he fails to act against terrorists indeed the risks to national unity may have been apparent today but so were the risks of not risking unity as demonstrated by the man who was not there mr arafat mr arafat led his people from behind never completely alienating any group or excluding any option including terrorism he wanted national unity said one diplomat who has studied him closely but you ca n't have national unity while you have people getting blown up in coffee shops
 president bush has again made his case for war against iraq and again his primary argument is the threat that saddam hussein poses to america the president 's critics are quick to point out that the central intelligence agency and other experts feel that for the moment saddam hussein is unlikely to conduct terrorist attacks against america however they warn us if an invasion threatens his regime his agents or his extremist sympathizers might well attack us possibly even using weapons of mass destruction so is it really a good idea to press ahead with regime change are n't we better off now than we would be if we invade iraq and risk setting off a dreadful response these are natural questions but they are neither logical nor helpful they are a prime example in our public discourse of what might be called parmenides fallacy named after the greek philosopher who held that all change was illusion this fallacy occurs when one tries to assess a future state of affairs by measuring it against the present as opposed to comparing it to other possible futures let me give a famous example of parmenides fallacy in operation the turning point in the 1980 presidential race came in a debate when ronald reagan criticized president jimmy carter 's record by asking the american people are you better off today than you were four years ago while rhetorically devastating this question is hardly the way to evaluate a presidency after all the state of the nation will never stay the same for four years regardless of who is in office a more relevant question to have asked would have been are you better off now than you would have been if gerald ford had continued as president and if he had had to cope with rising oil prices a revolution in iran a russian invasion of afghanistan and soaring interest rates or consider the 2001 invasion of afghanistan are we better off now than we were the day before we intervened probably not before that war we knew where al qaeda had its bases and it had not struck since sept 11 a number of american and allied soldiers who became casualties were then alive and unwounded public opinion in pakistan was less hostile to america there was a greater measure of sympathy around the world for our losses in new york and washington our economy and confidence in our markets were stronger but let 's ask the relevant question are we better off today than we would have been if we had let the taliban continue arming and sheltering our qaeda enemies many of whom we killed and captured in our intervention clearly we are vastly better off for having acted so as we look to the future we must stop debating whether invading iraq will result in our being worse down the line than we are right now we do not have the option of holding time still which exposes the biggest flaw in the why rush to war argument the urgency lies in the fact that every day saddam hussein stays in power he grows richer the global terrorist network to which he has access plans further atrocities and international inspections notwithstanding the chance of his acquiring nuclear chemical and biological weapons grows to avoid parmenides fallacy the question we must ask is will we be better off in the future if we invade iraq or if we do not invade those who believe that the status quo can be indefinitely extended through inspections then have an obligation to tell us how the inspectors would prevent saddam hussein from buying a weapon from say north korea which would be a rather dramatic change in the status quo supporters of an indefinite inspectors presence focus on large weapons like missile launchers that they say we will be able to detect although secretary of state colin powell 's masterful presentation to the security council last month and our experience hunting for scuds in the persian gulf war lead one to question that assumption but are they also considering that in the future we might have to detect and capture weapons no larger than a case of beer whether they admit it or not those who favor containment are asking for an ever more expensive united states armed presence in the region as well as perpetual sanctions that crush innocent iraqis even further this is because without troops on his borders saddam hussein would not admit inspectors and without the sanctions he could quickly replace whatever outlawed weapons we are lucky enough to find and destroy it is also misguided to believe that the threat of our overwhelming military force is enough to deter saddam hussein from aggression indefinitely were iraq to get weapons of mass destruction it would be able to deter us from interfering in any plans it had to broaden its control in the persian gulf region saddam hussein 's ambition to impose his will on his neighbors is the only reason he has resisted his obligations to the united nations for 12 years at great cost to iraq i recognize that we are running a terrible risk if we put saddam hussein 's back against the wall but unless we are willing to eventually grant him a free hand in the persian gulf he is bound to act in a way that will put his back against the wall in the future after he does acquire nuclear weapons at that point however the united states would have a significantly diminished capacity to prevent his aggression one certainly can not imagine an operation like desert storm if iraq were to acquire nuclear warheads and accurate missiles we should also consider the future of the iraqi civilians yes they would suffer the horrors of war in the near term which for a time would be even worse than life under the sanctions now but if an american led intervention succeeded the country 's oil revenues could once again enrich its people as well as its schools hospitals and financial institutions the iraqis would be much better off after an invasion than they would be living indefinitely chained to saddam hussein for us though we live in relative tranquillity at present we will at least be far less badly off in the future if we act now parmenides fallacy must not paralyze our imaginations or our will op ed contributor philip bobbitt a law professor at the university

 the arnold schwarzenegger bus tour made its final stop on sunday on the lawn of the state capitol addressing a crowd of 10000 mr schwarzenegger was upbeat and avoided comment on the headlines of recent days about women who said the actor had molested them or a book proposal that quoted him saying he admired hitler he did not refer to yellow journalism nor did any of his supporters here try to rally the crowd as one did on saturday to beat up reporters on sunday mr schwarzenegger drove the high road invoking the name of ronald reagan and his old line about the shining city on the hill still mr schwarzenegger did not totally escape discussion of the controversy in an interview with tom brokaw on the news program dateline nbc shown sunday night mr schwarzenegger was asked repeatedly about the accusations that he had made unsolicited advances toward women well first of all a lot of these are made up stories mr schwarzenegger said i never grabbed anyone that i pulled up their shirt and grabbed their breasts and stuff like that this is not me so there 's a lot of this stuff going on that is not true asked if he planned to be more specific about the charges mr schwarzenegger replied as soon as the campaign is over i will i can get into all of the specifics and find out what is really going on he said but right now i 'm just really occupied with the campaign as he has in recent days he talked about dirty politics especially if you become the front runner they 're going to throw everything that you 've done into the kitchen sink he said mr schwarzenegger who is leading in the polls for the recall election to replace gov gray davis on tuesday has been accused by 15 women in recent days of groping or sexual harassment there was an unusual amount of things about you know about women 's stuff that i did not expect it 's really like they 're coming out of nowhere all those things it 's you know painful in many ways because i know a lot of the stuff is not true he said though some democrats were game to make noise on sunday others were visibly glum it says a lot when mr schwarzenegger can draw more davis supporters to his events than mr davis can draw to his own the democrats continued to bring up the recent campaign controversies bob mulholland campaign adviser to the state democratic party was at the event on sunday morning and even he had to admire the turnout but not entirely he does n't draw as big a crowd as hitler did mr mulholland said tartly and so it went from beginning to end on mr schwarzenegger 's california comeback express tour no matter where he went questions about his past were there to meet him for most of the trip mr schwarzenegger was not asked about issues but rather about his character for instance not once on his trip through the san joaquin valley the breadbasket of california did mr schwarzenegger mention the word agriculture minute by minute day by day there was a new crisis the first day started with an article in the los angeles times with charges by six women of unwanted sexual advances mr schwarzenegger apologized at his kickoff rally in san diego yes it is true that i was on rowdy movie sets and i have done things that were not right which i thought then was playful mr schwarzenegger said he added i am sorry about that later that day mr schwarzenegger had to deal with a book proposal that said that mr schwarzenegger as a young bodybuilder had expressed admiration for hitler i always despised everything that hitler stands for he said i grew up with friends that were jewish and with people that were of the jewish religion i did n't think they were jewish because they were all blended in at times maria shriver was brought on stage to stand by her man she laid a moist kiss on his lips in fresno
 sarah collins rudolph even with one eye of glass can still see the morning of sept 15 1963 can see it sharp and clear she can still see four pretty girls including her sister addie mae collins primping in the church basement just minutes before they were to ascend the stairs and sing with the grown ups in the choir at 16th street baptist church she can see the water running over her 12 year old hands as she washed them in the ladies lounge see a 14 year old addie mae fussing with the sash of denise mcnair who was just 11 and still played with dolls she can see them all there framed by the basement window addie mae denise cynthia wesley and carole robertson just before the earth shook and the glass flew at her face and eyes like buckshot then she could not see at all her eyes pierced by the shrapnel and she lay in the darkness and called addie addie addie with mrs rudolph 's account here today of the bombing of the 16th street baptist church prosecutors rested their case in the state murder trial of bobby frank cherry the 71 year old white supremacist who is believed to be the last living suspect in a historic act of evil when she could finally see again after the operations and the bandages and the loss of her right eye mrs rudolph could see that it was the simple act of washing her hands that spared her and that a few seconds later she would have been with her friends in front of that window just feet from the bomb glass went in my eyes mrs rudolph said as prosecutors showed the jury a picture of her in the hospital then her eyes covered with white bandages but the few feet between where she stood and her friends was the bridge between life and death as she spoke a gray haired woman in the jury box tried not to cry her bottom lip trembled mrs rudolph did not cry she walked back to her chair sat down and folded her arms and began to wait as she has waited for 38 years for a little more justice in a case that began back when a young wavy haired man named bobby frank cherry first became one of the fbi 's prime suspects in an investigation that sputtered and stumbled across four decades just a few hours before another prosecution witness had described a slightly older mr cherry a man who had left the klan behind in alabama in the 1970 's and moved to texas to open a carpet cleaning business and brag to relatives about the day in alabama that he struck a historic blow for white supremacy teresa francesca stacy mr cherry 's granddaughter told the jury that she heard her grandfather boast of the bombing on the front porch of his trailer in east texas he said he helped blow up a bunch of niggers back in birmingham said ms stacy who was about 10 at the time he seemed rather jovial as he said it she said she said she only heard mr cherry say that once but had heard other relatives say that he had told them that same thing several times i 've heard it for years she said in 1997 she saw her grandfather in a television press conference he denied any role in the bombing i knew he was lying ms stacy said i called the news people they put me on hold for a long time i hung up the phone and called the fbi mickey johnson mr cherry 's defense lawyer then began chipping away at ms stacy 's credibility by asking her questions about her motive for her testimony and her past he asked ms stacy if the attention from the case including articles in glamour magazine and texas monthly and an appearance on good morning america had changed your life he suggested that she had offered her testimony in return for a deal from prosecutors to reduce the sentence of her brother who is serving a prison term in texas for robbery and burglary well i figured i should n't be dragged through the mud for nothing she said mr johnson over the objections of prosecutors but with the blessing of judge james garrett then asked ms stacy about her addictions to drugs and alcohol she told him that she had been addicted to drugs when she was 12 and was in a rehabilitation at age 13 my drug of choice was cocaine she said she said she is also a recovering alcoholic who drinks socially ms stacy was not the first relative to say in this trial that mr cherry boasted about the killings willadean brogdon a still angry former wife who was married to mr cherry from 1970 until their divorce in 1973 testified on thursday that she had heard him brag about the bombing and that he told her he was the man who actually planted the bomb underneath a church stairwell the night before the explosion officially mr cherry has repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with that bombing and told investigators in 1997 that he could not have been involved in making or planting the bomb on the night of saturday sept 14 1963 the night investigators have long believed the bomb was placed because he was at home with his wife who was ill with cancer mr cherry told investigators he went home to be with her and to watch wrestling later in an interview with jerry mitchell of the clarion ledger in jackson miss he said he always watched wrestling on saturday nights mr mitchell in a search of television logs found that there was no wrestling on television that night because there has been no forensic evidence linking him to the blast prosecutors have tried to build a case of circumstantial evidence heavy with testimony about mr cherry 's hatred of blacks and his desire to keep them from mixing with whites in the birmingham of the 1960 's bob herren an fbi agent who interviewed mr cherry in texas in 1997 said mr cherry told him that in 1957 he used a pair of brass knuckles to punch the rev fred shuttlesworth bopped shuttlesworth between the eyes mr cherry told him mr herren testified fred shuttlesworth would go on to become a civil rights hero in birmingham mr herren said mr cherry told him the ku klux klan never would have blown up a church because the klan was a religious organization itself he told me he sang in the klan choir at churches and funerals mr herren said mr herren said mr cherry also told him he had joined the klan because he wanted to work on political campaigns and wanted to chase women when he went to klan rallies day after day prosecution witnesses have described a much different birmingham from the one that exists today a city where blacks and whites mix and mingle in restaurants and office buildings the whites only signs are long gone but it was a different place the day that chris mcnair denise 's father remembered from the witness stand here today too vividly he said he had gone to a different church that day on birmingham 's southside he remembers hearing a faraway boom he turned to his brother and asked is that thunder as he spoke about the death of his daughter in what some people saw as a war by some whites against blacks prosecutors showed the jury a picture of denise holding her favorite doll it has pink skin and blonde hair it is white
 the european union is poised to drop its threat of rapid retaliation against united states tariffs on imported steel imposed in the spring senior officials said today the european commission the union 's executive body has drafted a recommendation that sanctions involving over 300 million of goods should be shelved until after a ruling by the world trade organization which is expected next year the europeans retreat on steel comes after the bush administration scaled back its proposed tariffs on steel imports exempting a further 178 steel products and largely defusing the dispute in march when the united states announced import tariffs of as much as 30 percent the european union was concerned that europe would be flooded by steel imports from other countries that had been priced out of the united states but this side effect has not been so dramatic a top commission official said today since march the bush administration has narrowed the product categories of steel that would be subject to the tariffs to the point where more than half the european steel exports to the united states are now exempt and steel prices have stabilized recently weakening the case for an immediate retaliation all these things together led us to the conclusion that sanctions are not necessary at the moment the commission official said but some diplomats representing the 15 member nations of the european union in brussels said the commission was backing away from unilateral sanctions because it would not get the majority support for rapid sanctions it needs from the member states the commission will present its recommendation to foreign ministers of the member state governments on monday the threat of sanctions has been enough to force the bush administration to water down its steel tariff regime said one diplomat who spoke only on the condition of anonymity why crank up the pressure now when the commission first considered sanctions against the united states it drew up a a list of products including citrus fruit textiles and steel products with the intention of hitting american industries in states that are important for the white house in next month 's congressional elections in addition to the exemptions already granted to european steel producers the bush administration has said it is considering reining in the tariffs even more united states officials have said that a new round of exemptions will be considered between november and next march
 directed by nigel noble not rated 70 minutes without getting into the guns and butter details of economic theory nigel noble 's bluntly downbeat documentary the charcoal people presents a hard headed picture of how the laws of supply and demand in brazil are contributing to the destruction of the amazon rain forest charcoal people is the nickname for thousands of migrant workers across the country who earn a meager living making the charcoal that is an ingredient of the pig iron used in brazil 's steel industry about half the wood used to produce charcoal comes from eucalyptus plantations the other half comes from cutting and burning timber in the rain forest whose leveling has already decimated an area the size of france much of the film which opens today at the screening room 54 varick street tribeca takes an up close view of impoverished migrant workers and their families desperate for money these uneducated laborers whose dream is to save enough to somehow become independent are willing to travel anywhere where there is money to be made producing charcoal many of them send home money to families they have left behind and are unable to visit for years at a stretch the film documents the process by which whole forests are reduced to blocks of charred timber the timber is shipped by truck to work camps where it is fed into rows of giant kilns it takes a day to build one that resemble brick and mortar igloos high among the hazards the workers must contend with are the infernal heat and choking smoke generated by the kilns as the workers tell their stories the struggles they describe are n't all that different from those of exploited laborers all over the world be they coal miners or sweat shop employees those who ask for raises are often considered troublemakers and fired one worker recalls a boss who kept the workers in debt by forcing them to buy their supplies from the company store not all the testimony is meant to appall more than one person interviewed actually finds some satisfaction in the work the cost to the environment of course is steep just how steep is suggested late in the film by aerial shots of a hideously scarred smoky section of rain forest but the movie leaves little doubt that as long as there is an industry hungry for their labor the charcoal people and the destruction they wreak will continue stephen holden

 high tides and heavy winds today forced the suspension of efforts to recover diesel and bunker fuel leaking from a grounded tanker that has already spilled more than 150000 gallons into pristine waters teeming with some of the world 's most unusual marine and bird species a new oil slick that resulted has already killed off fish and marine organisms and plants in the area around the ship more ominously officials here said the new spill threatens to drift toward neighboring islands that have large populations of sea lions marine iguanas and blue footed boobies despite the pounding surf cleanup and animal rescue efforts by ecuador which has governed the archipelago since the middle of the last century were continuing about 100 employees of the galapagos national park have been joined by scientists from the charles darwin research station local fishermen volunteers and a united states coast guard team given the circumstances they have been doing a fantastic job said capt edwin stanton the commander of the coast guard unit which arrived here on san cristobal island on sunday at the request of the government what they lack in equipment and infrastructure they are making up for in innovation and sheer effort the environmental peril in the galapagos islands designated a world heritage site by the united nations because of the unusual wildlife began jan 16 when a tanker loaded with 243000 gallons of fuel went aground on a reef as it was preparing to dock rescue teams were able to remove some of the oil but on friday night the hull cracked and the fuel began leaking into the pacific ocean fernando espinoza secretary general of the charles darwin foundation said the main spill now dispersed over more than 775 square miles had already reached santa cruz which is about 50 miles northwest of here and is the most populated island today residents there were busy trying to remove oil from the shores of tortuga bay a popular beach and the harbor at puerto ayora the main settlement scientists and government officials said the original spill was widely dispersed and in many areas was merely a sheen that has helped speed evaporation and reduced the chance of extensive permanent damage to the delicate environment which inspired darwin to develop the theory of natural selection when he visited here in 1835 eliecer cruz director of the national park said that because of unpredictable and shifting winds and currents it was too early to determine where the new much smaller slick from today 's spill might be heading but he expressed concern at signs that it could be headed south toward islands with large populations of rare animals including espanola the sole nesting place of the waved albatross this afternoon the stricken tanker the jessica could still be seen listing at a 50 degree angle about 500 yards offshore the vessel took a severe pounding tuesday and today captain stanton said we could hear the bulkheads popping ecuadorean navy officials said that they would try to right the vessel on thursday in an effort to halt the leakage but the navy has only three small tugboats here and whether they will have the strength required is not clear assessment of responsibility for the spill is just beginning and today vice adm gonzalo vega of the merchant marine announced the arrest of the jessica 's captain tarquino arevalo and 13 crewmen who were ordered confined to a military base on san cristobal pending formal charges the associated press reported local fishermen who have been fighting with the government about quotas for lobster and sea cucumber catches have been using buckets to skim oil from the surface we are the ones who are most affected by this tragedy and we do n't want to be blamed for any dropoff in the fish population said franklin zavala president of the local fishermen 's cooperative conspicuously absent from the cleanup efforts however was the galapagos explorer the tourist cruise ship that had been scheduled to receive much of the leaked fuel there has been no offer from the owners to help even though other tourism companies have offered their vessels as floating dormitories for our recovery teams or are raising money for relief efforts mr cruz said
 the north and south korean governments traded charges today over who was responsible for a clash at sea in which a south korean patrol boat was sunk and four south koreans were killed another 22 south korean marines and sailors were wounded in the battle this morning which broke out in the same yellow sea waters where north and south korean naval forces fought three years ago north korea did not reveal casualties or the extent of damage suffered by its vessels and did not immediately respond to a request by the united nations command for talks in the truce village of panmunjom the incident dashed hopes here that the world cup soccer tournament in its final weekend might encourage efforts at reconciliation with the north the clash came hours before south korea 's team was defeated by turkey in a match for third place played in the south korean city of taegu president kim dae jung in an emergency meeting of his national security council ordered thorough measures by the armed forces to prevent a recurrence of hostilities but stopped short of implying that south korean forces would go on the offensive against north korea rather he asked the armed forces to strengthen security preparedness while instructing his aides to take all necessary measures so that citizens will be able to go about their daily business mr kim who has fostered a sunshine policy of engagement with the north was clearly eager to balance the need for defense against the north with his desire to ensure that the shootout today would be an isolated incident denouncing what he said were armed provocations by the north korean navy 's patrol ships mr kim called the attack a clear violation of the armistice that ended the korean war in july 1953 that increases tensions on the korean peninsula that reality must not be overlooked he observed while calling for calm in south korea north and south korea offered opposing versions of who was responsible for the attack south korea 's defense minister kim dong shin called for an apology from north korea along with punishment of those responsible for this unreasonable provocation it was he said unmistakably clear that the north bore the entire responsibility for this incident north korea in a statement carried by the official korea central news agency several hours later said the south koreans committed such a grave provocation as firing bullets and shells at its boats it was in retaliation against this said the north korean report that the north 's warships were compelled to take a self defensive step in which there was an exchange of fire between the two sides causing losses lt gen lee sang hee chief of operations of the south korean armed forces in a briefing carried by south korea 's four television networks said a north korean patrol boat crossed what is known as the northern limit line extending off the western end of the demilitarized zone at 9 54 am the vessel opened fire at 10 25 am he said after ignoring south korean warnings to return to its side of the line a buffer zone established by the united nation command after the korean war but never recognized by the north a map released by the defense ministry showed the shooting as having occurred several miles west of a small south korean island about 40 miles off the coast the shooting went on for 20 minutes said the defense ministry but the north inflicted the worst damage in the opening salvo killing the skipper of a south korean vessel along with three marines who were manning positions on the deck and wounding another 20 all apparently on the same vessel the number killed seemed likely to rise with one sailor reported missing tonight analysts in the south said the north had deliberately instigated the shootout this morning just as large crowds were gathering on squares and streets throughout the country to cheer the south korean soccer team in its match against turkey this attack is not an accident said a commentary carried by the korea broadcasting system because of world cup the north koreans wanted to get some attention some analysts said that the incident was part of an effort by hard line military leaders in north korea to undermine efforts at reconciliation and embarrass the south at the end of the world cup tournament there are some hawkish people inside north korea who wanted to ruin the world cup said choi jin wook a senior analyst at the korea institute of national unification affiliated with the government 's unification ministry responsible for south korean relations with the north the fact that the north korean leader kim jong il authorized broadcasts of a number of the matches including south korea 's victories over italy and spain may have contributed to the desire to instigate an incident mr choi said they saw everyone in the world was looking at south korea during the world cup he said somebody in north korea was opposed to kim jong il 's decision and hostile to any gesture toward the south or the united states it is very much a calculated plan one reason for believing the incident might not escalate into more fighting said analysts was the precedent set in the much more serious shootout in the yellow sea on june 15 1999 a south korean vessel sunk a north korean torpedo boat and severely damaged another killing at least 20 north korean sailors but the episode was later ascribed to an order given by a local north korean commander not to kim jong il or his top aides

 following are excerpts from ariel sharon 's speech yesterday to a special session of the israeli parliament as provided by the prime minister 's office the full text is available at nytimescom world our dead lie in a long row women and children young and old and we stand facing them facing the vacuum created by their murders and we are speechless on the recent evening of the seder while i was sitting with my family at the table i received the terrible news of the massacre in netanya there is no more dreadful moment in the term of a prime minister than that horrendous moment when the telephone rings or a note is passed during a meeting and carrying job 's tidings and then the sights and sounds come rushing in the sights of destruction the cries of the wounded the sirens then the awful silence of the funerals the faces and human stories which stare at us from the newspapers victims of coexistence those whose worlds fell apart while eating at an arab restaurant in haifa their blood mixing with the blood of israeli arabs who were sitting beside them entire families jewish and arab are destroyed in the heat of the murderous insanity which has taken hold of our palestinian neighbors and thus the killers and dispatchers intend to destroy the hope for peace hope for the future and hope for a normal life it is not a coincidence it is not cruel fate the murderous gangs have a leader a purpose and a directing hand they have one mission to chase us out of here from everywhere from our home in elon moreh and from the supermarket in jerusalem from the cafe in tel aviv and from the restaurant in haifa from the synagogue in netzarim where the murderers slaughtered over 70 worshipers walking in their prayer shawls to morning prayers and from the seder table in netanya and there is one dispatcher palestinian authority chairman yasir arafat he is the man who in a series of agreements promised to abandon the path of terrorism refrain from committing murder use his forces to prevent it and betrayed all his promises because of his promises israel agreed to the establishment of the palestinian authority that is why israel agreed to transfer security responsibility in the areas given to its control thus israel agreed to the establishment of palestinian security forces we hoped that the palestinians would understand as they promised that ruling does not mean a license to kill but rather the assumption of responsibility for the prevention of killing we never intended and do not intend to permanently reoccupy palestinian cities in my talks with president bush and recognizing his sincere wish for peace in our region i have promised to make every effort to accelerate our military activities and to withdraw our forces from those places in which our actions have been completed in these security zones our forces will deploy to constitute a buffer between palestinian territories and our territories in order to prevent any penetration into israeli communities attacks on israeli citizens and threats to our security but peace can only be attained if once we evacuate the territories we find a responsible palestinian leadership willing to accept the primary responsibility of every regime to prevent the use of its territory for the purpose of killing and murdering its neighbors accordingly israel accepts and warmly welcomes the important initiative of us president george w bush since the horrific attack on sept 11th exactly one year after the outbreak of the palestinian terrorist campaign against israel the united states has been leading the world in a heroic struggle to uproot terrorism as well as the regimes which support and sponsor it israel is proud of its friendship with the united states and of america 's leadership in the moral and historic political military struggle against the forces of evil which have risen up against the civilized nations since that deadly attack in september the partnership between israelis and americans has unfortunately become a partnership of blood between victims of terror we are partners to the principle set forth by president bush in his most recent speech and i quote terror must be stopped no nation can negotiate with terrorists for there is no way to make peace with those whose only goal is death if such a palestinian leadership should arise it will find in israel a hand extended toward peace and negotiations peace is important to israel but not only to israel it is important to the palestinians because only through peace will they find their way to existence as a nation in dignity and prosperity peace is important to all the peoples of the middle east because the continuation of terror and violence encourages fundamentalist elements and regimes to try and achieve their goals through violence despite the extreme demands included in the resolutions of the conference of arab leaders in beirut i welcome the fact that an important arab leader such as abdullah of saudi arabia has for the first time acknowledged israel 's right to exist within secure and recognized borders there is a positive component of the saudi initiative but the details must be negotiated in the absence of open dialogue between the parties this initiative will remain devoid of any real content the united states can and should be a leading and driving force behind such an initiative us secretary of state colin powell will be arriving in the region this week i intend to discuss methods of achieving an end to terrorism and advancing my initiative to meet with regional leaders in order to restart the negotiating process on the framework for peace in the middle east

 the newly opened sir william 's dog run is the city 's only run whose fence keeps dogs out not in last weekend to the delight of dog lovers the acre of sloping land not far from the cloisters in fort tryon park became the parks department 's first unfenced off leash area the small fence keeps dogs from harming the roots of a towering beech tree on a corner of the lawn dogs may run where they want as owners stand around like parents at a soccer game breaking up the occasional squabble when friendly jostling leads to unexpected snarling the lack of perimeter fencing is partly because of the area 's landscape it is nearly enclosed by rocky outcroppings shrubs and retaining walls that isolate it from the rest of the park but residents and park officials also credited an unusual level of cooperation between residents and government when other suggested spots for a dog run did not work out a group of owners invited the local parks chief jane schachat to what was then known as the gazebo lawn by summer 's end they had reached an agreement to declare an off leash zone some of the battles to get dog runs in the city have turned into long fights with parks said persio logos president of the dog owners group this was a positive proactive approach we kept the lines of communication open mr logos was host to a low key soiree in his washington heights home oct 18 to introduce the idea to community groups parks commissioner henry j stern came with his golden retriever boomer to dedicate the area as sir william 's dog run named after sir william tryon the last colonial governor of new york dog owners are often the most faithful users of areas of the park that others do n't use mr stern said we 're happy to have them as long as they follow the rules to some extent the change simply legalized the status quo dog owners had been using the space for years as an unofficial off leash area but mostly before 9 am and after 9 pm when leash laws are less strictly enforced now they no longer have to choose between watching the clock or risking a 100 fine repaired street lamps are also encouraging people and dogs to come at night the dog run is open 24 hours a day monday morning around 8 30 a park regular luther a border collie black labrador mix was playing with his friends at the dog run it was really nice to see everybody get together and say 'ok you can do this legally and we wo n't yell at you anymore said todd crain 29 an actor and luther 's owner luther was too busy socializing to notice the difference seth kugel

 having succeeded in making computer memory chips consumer electronics and automobiles south korea has set its sights on a far loftier goal conquering outer space the government plans to develop a rocket capable of ferrying satellites into orbit within the next five years at a cost that space agency officials estimate at 500 million to 1 billion although independent experts said the cost could run as high as several billion dollars the project still in the planning stages represents south korea 's hope to join the elite ranks of other space faring nations and free itself from dependence on other countries to launch its satellites and provide military surveillance but united states officials have reservations about south korea 's ambitions fearing that the project may not be economically viable and that the rocket technology could be exported to countries who may use it for military applications south korea says that the project would be sufficiently financed and that the rocket technology would not be suitable for military purposes announcing the project last month president kim dae jung said that south korea would build a working satellite launching facility by the year 2005 constructed with korean technology and equipment he promised that the government would allocate enough money for the rocket program and for research and development in other high technology fields including electronics and computer software south korean space agency officials said they hope to build a world class space program and they have grand visions of one day working with the united states and other countries on projects like a reusable space shuttle and an international space station south korea 's decision to develop a satellite launching station reflects the dramatic comeback of this proud nation following the asian financial crisis which had caused the government to shelve the project as too expensive although little is known about south korea 's rocket technology some satellite experts believe that the country could produce its own satellite launching vehicles but security experts and western officials speaking on condition of anonymity expressed concern that the technology that south korea hopes to develop to to launch satellites could also be used to make long range ballistic missiles without the proper checks and balances they said other countries could view the space project as having military applications and an arms race might begin in northeast asia this type of satellite rocket technology is transferable to military applications and other countries in the region are certainly going to view south korea 's program through this prism said a united states government official who monitors missiles and weapons of mass destruction one of the reasons we are not fully pleased about countries starting up space launch programs that are not economically viable is that they could export the launching vehicle to someone else who has no intention of using it for satellites the official said under a 1979 accord with the united states south korea agreed to limit the range of its missiles to about 100 miles and promised to abide by treaty rules restricting the spread of nuclear weapons south korea has been seeking permission from the united states to increase the range of its ballistic missiles after north korea test fired a medium range missile in 1998 that flew over the japanese mainland and into the ocean at the time north korea claimed that the test launch was a multistage rocket designed to put a satellite into orbit last year north korea threatened to test fire a second missile with a much longer range but abandoned those plans after international protests and after the united states agreed to lift economic sanctions against the communist country although the united states recently agreed to increase the missile range limits for south korea to up to 180 miles korean officials want the united states to raise the missile range to 300 miles choi dong whan president of the korean aerospace research institute the government space agency said in an interview that korea 's space launching rocket program would be economically viable and that the project would not have military applications the space agency plans to develop a leaky fuel propellant rocket system that is not useful for intercontinental ballistic missiles which typically employ a solid propellant he said the south korean rocket is expected to operate at an altitude between 375 miles and 437 miles and initially would carry small satellites used for mapping coastline surveillance and weather forecasting mr choi said south korea would continue to rely on foreign firms to launch heavier communications satellites that are placed in orbit he said we do n't want to depend on other countries anymore mr choi said we pay a lot of money to outside countries and we have to wait for launching time which is dependent on their schedule and wastes our time and budget space agency officials said that south korea needs to place at least 19 new satellites in orbit by the year 2025 and that the country can build its own satellite launching pad for about the same cost of paying a foreign firm to launch four or five satellites south korea now has six satellites three for communications and broadcasting and three for scientific research and all carried into orbit abroad by foreign made rockets if its rocket is cost efficient south korea could also use the technology to compete in the lucrative commercial satellite launching business the highly competitive industry is currently dominated by three major players the boeing company 's delta rockets and lockheed martin 's atlas rockets both from the united states and ariane rockets made by the european consortium arianespace russia and china have small portions of the market but space experts said that south korea faces considerable challenges building a launching vehicle made solely with its own technology particularly in integrating the various systems of the rocket despite years of development and billions of dollars in expenditures many advanced countries still struggle to master rocket technology last month japan said that it was abandoning its troubled h 2 rocket project after a series of costly failures including the loss of an h 2 rocket that plunged into the pacific ocean shortly after takeoff in november japanese which had invested 414 billion in the program since 1986 is still investigating the cause of the rocket failure still a growing number of countries are announcing plans to build their own satellites or develop rockets to launch them partly for the prestige that comes with such capability but also for the possible commercial and technological applications more and more countries are realizing that space is really the next frontier and not just for exploration said duane brown a spokesman for national aeronautics and space administration in the united states it 's expensive and takes a lot of hard work and trial and error but space has become a global venture that makes a lot of sense
 to the editor the iraq test editorial sept 13 says president bush 's blunt assessment of the iraqi threat and the need for a firm united response by the united nations was well put it was more than well put president bush displayed initiative imagination and a refreshing sense of strong responsibility in a compelling and powerful speech urging the united nations to take action against a rogue dictator before it is too late it was mr bush 's finest hour and it came the day after he met with relatives of the victims of 9 11 in three locations around the country demonstrating clearly his heartfelt remorse and empathy for the pain they have endured over the past year i did n't vote for mr bush but i wish i had paul schoenbaum williamsburg va sept 13 2002

 ariel sharon 's decisive electoral victory yesterday marks a sharp turn in israeli policies just 21 months after voting in ehud barak who promised to accelerate peace negotiations with the palestinians and syria israeli voters have chosen one of the country 's most unyielding politicians as prime minister mr sharon will now need to show that he can combine his customary toughness with enough flexibility to avoid aggravating an already combustible situation in israel and across the middle east in a conciliatory move last night mr sharon renewed his invitation to mr barak 's labor party to join him in a broad national unity government labor should accept the election culminates an improbable comeback by mr sharon as defense minister in 1982 he directed israel 's ill advised invasion of lebanon in an episode that nearly ended his career an official israeli panel found him indirectly responsible for atrocities committed by israel 's christian phalangist allies in palestinian refugee camps but mr sharon recovered and after the former prime minister benjamin netanyahu retired temporarily from politics mr sharon succeeded him as the likud leader his staged walk across jerusalem 's bitterly contested temple mount lighted the spark for more than four months of palestinian violence during the election campaign mr sharon suggested that he would break off further negotiations with the palestinians pending a complete end to the violence and then propose a settlement offering them roughly the territory they already control some 42 percent of the west bank and almost 90 percent of the gaza strip that was politically popular among israelis but it is not a realistic long term formula for peace just as richard nixon 's lifelong anti communist views allowed him to defrost relations with china mr sharon 's conservative credentials give him the latitude to try more creative approaches to the palestinians mr sharon has good reason to seek a unity government it would be difficult to assemble a stable governing majority if he limits himself to his own likud party and other right wing and religious groupings by accepting his offer labor may be able to exert a moderating influence washington should counsel the new government to maintain a steady course and avoid the impulse to escalate military confrontations with the palestinians israel can not afford to abandon the search for peace in the middle east that has lasted more than two decades despite his defeat mr barak deserves credit for his energetic pursuit of peace yasir arafat unwisely spurned mr barak 's proposals and then encouraged a palestinian uprising against israel that revolt doomed mr barak 's peace policy and assured mr sharon 's electoral triumph

 when amir hadad of israel and aisam ul haq qureshi of pakistan turned into a symbol of international detente as a doubles team at wimbledon they reveled in the attention that swirled around them but neither is sure if they will team up for a repeat performance at the united states open hadad and qureshi played in the ghi bronx tennis classic at crotona park this week the first time they have played in the same tournament or seen each other since wimbledon they also both lost in the bronx tournament in the first round of singles and playing with other partners in doubles when they advanced to the third round at wimbledon it was the best showing of their careers and although both say they remain the warmest of friends and will play together in future tournaments they seem to differ on whether they should play together at the open qureshi said that if they did not it would be because their combined doubles ranking of 219 would not get them in the main draw he seemed reluctant to ask for a wild card entry although hadad said he was sure they would get one if they asked qureshi seemed a bit wary of the reception they would receive in new york mindful of its large jewish population but hadad said he believed they would be as warmly received as they were in england i do n't want to push him i do n't know if he has problems hadad said yesterday after his doubles loss with grant silcock of australia it 's up to him i hope we play together it was very good for us they were for a few days the best story in tennis in a small way they were patching over a cultural and religious chasm hadad 24 and jewish had little in common with qureshi 22 and muslim except their sport but that was enough and they had become friends they teamed up at wimbledon for lack of other partners because they had played only in total obscurity they figured no one would notice their unusual pairing their relationship was never about religion or politics it was about tennis but a few reporters showed up at their first match and many more went to their second by their third match their story was being beamed around the world next thing we know we are on cnn bbc espn qureshi said everyone i knew called me it was nice to be popular a little bit neither shied away from the attention although qureshi endured an immediate backlash the pakistani tennis federation threatened to ban him from davis cup play if he continued playing with hadad qureshi defiantly refused to give in he says his federation has come around since then not only did the pakistani officials apologize to qureshi but they have also extended a davis cup invitation qureshi says this happened after the international tennis federation said it would ban pakistan from the davis cup if it followed through on its threat to qureshi it 's good now he said we are all happy qureshi said he had not been home to pakistan since wimbledon he trains in the netherlands but his parents had sent him copies of newspaper articles from their country they were all positive he said he said he was not worried about returning home after the open hadad too has enjoyed the reaction saving many of the bigger articles written about them he said the israeli news media were slow to cover the story running nothing more than his results at wimbledon only after he returned home did anyone write or broadcast more they did n't even pay attention he said when an israeli reporter called me i said 'i think you are slipping i am on cnn and the bbc since then though hadad said the reaction from home has been all positive he is sure it would be the same in new york if we do n't play in the open it would be a shame he said we are still friends but playing together is good for us match points the heat took its toll yesterday when valentina sassi of italy fell ill with what united states tennis association officials called heat stress sassi won a 3 hour 36 minute singles match against her doubles partner bahia mouhtassine of morocco 7 5 5 7 7 6 7 as the temperature hit 102 degrees and the heat index reached 112 sassi suffered severe cramping afterward and was taken by ambulance to st barnabas hospital in the bronx so she could receive intravenous fluids she was later released donna pallulat the usta women 's trainer said sassi never lost consciousness but could not walk because of the cramping bunny williams a usta official said the heat index was not out of the ordinary for summer events the rule for days with a heat index more than 90 is to give players a 10 minute break between the second and third sets both sassi and mouhtassine took cold showers during their break trainers are not authorized to stop a match or demand that a player not be allowed to play all we can do is stand by and hope they are ok pallulat said
 garden historians often refer to the first third of the 20th century as a golden age in the history of american garden design it was a time when wealthy people their tastes honed by travel had both the capital and the confidence to commission elaborate landscapes to match their magnificent homes in new jersey and elsewhere in the tristate area some of the best of those gardens were designed by ethelbert furlong 1894 1993 a landscape architect with an unusual name and a singular career spanning over 60 years furlong began his career as a young teenager when he mistakenly thought that a newspaper ad for a nursery man meant that he would have the opportunity to work with children he took the job even after finding out that it involved driving a wagon full of shrubs and trees to landscape installation sites furlong progressed quickly to supervising installations and he began learning drafting skills as a draftsman 's apprentice he eventually worked as a draftsman for a new york architectural firm in 1917 and in 1921 he hung out his own shingle he was admitted to the american society of landscape architects in 1933 his granddaughter the landscape architect joan furlong said that her grandfather made his last drawings in 1984 when he was 89 landscapes are ephemeral things and many of furlong 's survive only in the cache of drawings kept by his granddaughter what distinguishes his body of work and makes it relevant today are themes and motifs that appear again and again his early designs created during the 1920 's and 30 's were mostly for estate gardens full of traditional elements and axial symmetry after serving in world war ii he turned in a new direction and began producing modernist landscapes that were spare asymmetrical and often incorporated asian ideas as his career progressed furlong created landscapes for everything from corporate campuses to public housing projects in newark in 1949 when house beautiful magazine needed a landscape design to match its sleek modern pace setter house the editors turned to ethelbert furlong though he had never visited either japan or the asian mainland his appreciation of the traditions of eastern gardening led to the creation of a number of japanese style landscapes ultimately he collaborated with architect philip johnson on a japanese garden for the museum of modern art in new york furlong gardens have many things in common among them the use of mixed hard scaping materials different sizes and colors of stone brick and slate combined within a single design his home garden in essex nj is typical featuring pathways paved with tiny pebbles surrounded by borders made of larger stones subtle changes of level sometimes marked by rough stones are another constant as are juxtapositions of curves and angles fannie clark a gardener and garden designer who worked for furlong said his gardens have an informal 'formalism they make you pay attention furlong gardens are full of surprises some of his brick walls have oval windows that allow the viewer to look into adjoining garden rooms others are designed so that there are spaces between the bricks creating an openwork pattern furlong gardens large and small are also full of little pathways that lead to discreet niches statues or other intimate focal points water in the form of small waterfalls pools and fountains was an integral part of many of the landscapes sadly in most of the surviving furlong gardens that i walked through the water features are neglected the stone basins empty and the intricate fountainheads no longer trickle a musical stream changing tastes and development have obliterated many of furlong 's works but some homeowners have made efforts to restore or maintain them though she does not own a furlong garden diane clark of fair haven nj has gone a step further as a volunteer for the garden clubs of america she is part of a program sponsored by the smithsonian institution to document america 's heritage of significant gardens ms clark has tracked down furlong gardens in various places assembling photographs of them and coordinating her efforts with joan furlong who has kept grandfather 's work diaries and meticulously executed site plans the two women hope to find even more photographs and documentation of gardens that no longer exist eventually the pictures and some of the plans will go to the smithsonian institution 's collection however even the smithsonian does not have room for the hundreds of drawings joan furlong hopes to donate them to an educational institution so that future generations of landscape architects can relive a part of the golden age through the work of ethelbert furlong
 al leiter had been waiting four weeks for this four weeks for a chance to pitch again and to help resuscitate his lifeless team he was so eager he said last week that he hurried his comeback from an elbow injury when he otherwise might have held back leiter is the mets no 1 starter and an ace is supposed to be a superhero bobby valentine the mets manager confronted leiter about his timetable if you need more time take it valentine told him it 's not like 'hey please al you 're ready are n't you valentine said but whether or not the mets pressured him leiter clearly wanted to be back as soon as possible last night at shea stadium he showed the mets what they had been missing leiter sparkled for six innings as the mets beat kevin brown and the los angeles dodgers 8 0 it was the mets second victory in 10 games knowing what has gone on and knowing it has n't been a whole lot of fun around here i was n't doing my share leiter said i wanted to get out there and do what i needed to do leiter 1 3 knew he needed to throw all his pitches and approach the game with an anger and aggressiveness he hates it when he is passive on the defensive and sometimes he has to motivate himself to get tough this time the motivation was a given and all of his pitches were working leiter who had a strained flexor tendon in his left elbow got three of his six strikeouts with his curveball the pitch that had caused him the most pain he compared the potential impact of this game to the one he pitched in june 1999 at yankee stadium when he beat roger clemens and helped lift the mets into contention if this game sparks the mets 15 26 it will be because of more than leiter 's effort his return and what valentine called a lively lineup propelled the mets to the kind of victory they have not had in almost two weeks the last time they won on tuesday they managed only one run the time before that the mets won 10 9 after leading by 9 0 those had been their only victories since may 5 valentine batted darren bragg leadoff for the third game in a row and started three of his fastest players timo perez tsuyoshi shinjo and desi relaford valentine managed brown in texas and knew how futile it was for hitters to try to pull brown 's hard sinkers he felt that if the right mets reached base they could put themselves in motion on the ground balls brown would inevitably induce with some speed there we definitely had a chance to create some things on the base paths relaford said with someone as tough as brown you 've got to try to create whether it 's stealing a base moving guys over hit and run you 've got to do little things the mets did little and big things against brown 5 2 things they have not done recently against less heralded pitchers all of the mets starting position players except mike piazza had a hit off brown and piazza contributed an important defensive play with gary sheffield batting with one out in the sixth leiter 's last inning piazza tracked a high twisting pop up behind the plate it landed in his glove for the second out and piazza landed hard on his tailbone just in front of the wall leiter was removed for a pinch hitter in the bottom of the inning having allowed just four hits and a walk striking out six it was his first victory since last sept 20 a span of 10 starts including four in the postseason turk wendell pitched the final three innings allowing one hit and striking out three to earn his first save there was n't any sense of urgency valentine said because al was pretty much in control the mets are a stationary base to base team even on their good days but three different mets took an extra base on a single in the first four innings relaford singled to lead off the third and with one out valentine called for a hit and run with bragg batting relaford stole second as bragg swung and missed bragg then knocked in relaford from second on a single the mets had not had a lead at any point in leiter 's three previous starts and they immediately added to it when robin ventura a 356 career hitter against brown homered to lead off the fourth the mets scored three more runs on five more hits in the inning with shinjo and perez taking extra bases the mets had a 5 0 lead then and brown was finished he worked a season low four innings and surrendered a season high five runs and nine hits you ca n't go out there and pitch like that and expect to stay in the game brown said leiter for his part did not want to guess at how much his presence lifted his teammates it 's mighty big of someone to think they 're the reason he said ventura also found it difficult to characterize he just knew it made him happy you 're always glad to have your best pitcher ventura said knowing that he 's going every five days is a big boost inside pitch left fielder benny agbayani said he had fully recovered from the strained abdominal muscle injury he sustained last saturday but manager bobby valentine gave him an extra day out of the starting lineup as a precaution shortstop rey ordonez did not start because of back spasms he first felt while jumping off the bench to watch the flight of a potential homer in tuesday 's game ordonez said the condition worsened from thursday to yesterday a committee of mets coaches will manage the team today as valentine attends his son bobby jr 's high school graduation in arlington tex

 people attend flower shows for all sorts of reasons at this time of year some enjoy the heady fragrance of flowers and greens amid winter 's doldrums others crave the refreshing colors of daffodils and delphiniums and still others go to learn about new plants and how they can fit into borders and landscapes many of the exhibitors at the philadelphia flower show which opens next sunday are in the last category jack blandy for example has more than 300 david austin roses just about ready to bloom i 've never seen the flowers on the pilgrim dark lady and molineux roses he said in a recent interview and i 'm really looking forward to that mr blandy said he chose the austin roses for his exhibit because their fragrance and old fashioned soft beauty matched the show 's theme the pleasures of the garden he also likes these roses for their ease of care he 'll place 250 roses in the exhibit both as hedges and intermingled with other plants with the remaining 50 or so to serve as backups he ordered the roses last winter and by april had them all planted in the fields at his stoney bank nursery in glen mills pa there they were pruned fed and trimmed so that by the time they were placed in greenhouses last fall they were twice the size of plants one normally buys and sees at garden centers once inside the greenhouse under a carefully controlled temperature and feeding regime the plants which had not been allowed to flower the previous summer could barely control their innate desire to burst forth with buds mr blandy is not sure how many of the 40 varieties he has will make it to the show some like his favorites gertrude jekyll with rich pink flowers and graham thomas with butter yellow blossoms will definitely be featured others which he has never grown before will have to perform well before he sets up the exhibit in order to ensure a place michael petrie of styer nurseries in concordville pa loves to experiment and has no qualms about trying untested plants in his eye catching exhibits we all like to try plants we personally think are interesting he said of the exhibitors mr petrie particularly likes to promote plants that are just entering the nursery trade and uses his flower show display to demonstrate their potential unusual and underused annuals will be among the features in his display this year he 's hoping that a white cultivar of leonetis leonurus will do better than the species plant he grew last year the species of this fragrant plant grows seven feet tall in its native south africa in mr petrie 's greenhouse however it soared to 8 1 2 feet and at that height did not like being moved on a cold winter day to the flower show one hour after it arrived the leaves started to drop and mr petrie had to quickly find a replacement plant alba the very rare white cultivar only grows four feet tall and mr petrie is hoping its shorter stature will make it more amenable to a move from his greenhouse to the pennsylvania convention center where the show runs through march 10 information on the show is available at wwwtheflowershowcom or through its sponsor the pennsylvania horticultural society at 215 988 8800 mr petrie likes this annual not only for its lovely scent but also for its dramatic appearance its flowers look like hair on a lion 's mane and climb up the tall stem in whirls rounded seed clusters shortly follow and hold for a long time he also has several salvias in his display calling them one of the most neglected underused group of annuals with great late season impact among these is black and blue an s guaranitica cultivar with a black hood over a gentian blue flower about four feet tall this salvia tolerates shade mr petrie is excited about an agave family member with the impossible to remember botanical name of beschorneria yuccoides three feet in height and diameter this plant features wide bluish green strap leaves that curve out to form a striking centerpiece in a container cugliotta landscape in southampton nj has designed the main display of this year 's show a victorian themed garden and it is packed with thousands of flowers shrubs and trees that demonstrate at least one of the five senses the designers laurel allen doug burgess and joe cugliotta looked near and far to select plants for their display one nearby site was mr cugliotta 's home he allowed his huge weeping beech fagus sylvatica pendula to be dug and placed as a striking sculptural accent in the display the three also searched literature to find and grow the most praiseworthy plants there is a great emphasis on fragrance in their design and one of the stars in this area is hosta guacamole which has been described by tony avent a well known nurseryman as one of the most exciting to hit the market in years it features chartreuse gold foliage edged in dark green and large near white beguilingly scented flowers in the taste section of their sensory garden they are featuring the white flowers of heritage raspberry rubus species left in natural settings this would produce fruit of high quality during the show however spectators will have to be content with the sight of its attractive blossoms while

 massacre at the palace the doomed royal dynasty of nepal by jonathan gregson 255 pages talk miramax books 2495 if jonathan gregson 's account of nepal 's turbulent history is to be believed the fate of that country 's monarchy may have been determined by a bowl of curd his book describes the 18th century legend surrounding prithvi narayan shah the first leader to rule nepal as a unified kingdom this king is said to have offered the curd to a hermit who consumed it and then to have been aghast when the hermit vomited it back at him but the hermit was actually a disguised deity named gorakhnath and because the king shied away from the regurgitated curd the deity put a curse on the royal family prithvi narayan shah was told that his family 's dynasty would endure for 10 generations and then come to an end cut to narayanhiti palace in kathmandu on june 1 2001 the 10th member of the shah family regime was about to come to a catastrophic end the heavily armed crown prince dipendra opened fire and mowed down the royal family killing his parents brother and sister among others dipendra shot himself as well and survived virtually brain dead for two days during which he was regarded as nepal 's new king nobody not even the most morbid of jacobean playwrights or greek tragedians mr gregwon writes could have invented a plot with so much self inflicted damage nor such a bizarre twist at the end curd aside what happened in massacre at the palace mr gregson can only speculate on the exact nature of dipendra 's grievance concurring with early reports that the killer 's thwarted desire to marry his sweetheart helped to unhinge him but mr gregson can explain why this mayhem shocking as it was for nepal may not have been altogether surprising his history of nepal 's royal machinations is filled with persistently bizarre eruptions of internecine violence the first half of this book provides an overview of nepal 's complex aristocracy unfortunately this account is not accompanied by a map genealogical chart or bibliography that might shed additional light on these matters but perhaps that is understandable mr gregson describes contrasts among tribes like limbus rais rajbansis dhimals bodos chepangs and kusundas and that is just on a single page he notes that it has been estimated that there are as many different languages and dialects spoken within nepal as in the whole of western europe and he explains the trickiness of nepal 's geographical position between india and china which prithvi narayan shah described as being like a yam between two boulders mr gregson illustrates the various s words that helped to sustain the shah monarchy in this remote setting succession the rules for choosing each king were strictly codified to the point where the sovereign on the book 's cover is king tribhuvan photographed as a 5 year old in royal robes sati a royal widow was expected to undergo this ritual cremation but she could be saved if her son ascended the throne and she had an obvious interest in advancing his cause smallpox nepalese royalty was much afflicted by this disease which wrought havoc with the family tree and superstition the king 's divinity was widely accepted by his people hence the reverence with which even the most vicious and ineffectual of monarchs was held by his subjects in this dry but extremely eventful early part of his account mr gregson also explores the intricate dealings between the monarchs and their government ministers who assumed the princely title rana from the name of a prominent family and often wielded more influence than the rulers they represented and he explains how nepal became increasingly exposed to outside influences that shaped its rulers tastes and heightened restlessness even if acquiring automobiles in this remote region once meant having rolls royces and cadillacs carried by porters over two mountain ranges to reach kathmandu by the time prince dipendra had been enrolled at eton and nicknamed dippy apparently as much for his dipsomania as for his name mr gregson suggests that the royal palace had become a suffocating environment for a young man with worldly ambitions and dipendra had shown early signs of instability in any case he liked weapons took drugs and had a habit of punching people 'as a joke which some etonians did not find so funny massacre at the palace presents this behavior as an echo of earlier royal black sheep like crown prince surendra who in the mid 19th century would order his subjects to jump down a well or ride a horse off a cliff just to see whether they would die regardless of whether such unattributed stories are authoritative or apocryphal mr gregson a journalist who grew up in calcutta and has written extensively about the himalayan region presents a coherent pattern of decline he suggests that the very outmoded and restrictive customs that long protected nepal 's monarchy have also been infantilizing and destructive as much for the country 's residents as for its rulers the post dipendra weakened shah dynasty now faces civil unrest and the influence of maoist insurgents not to mention the burden of having watched the country 's most revered royal traditions turn into tabloid fodder mr gregson provides an interesting thoughtful account without sinking to that level

 to the editor re raising shutterbugs in a megapixel age may 23 i teach digital imaging to students at eisenhower middle school in wyckoff nj based on my experiences with over 300 students i beg to differ with the assertion of fatima nejame executive director of the palm beach photographic center in delray beach fla that there is no magic in the computer the computer 's digital darkroom is equally if not more engaging than a traditional darkroom my students start the course with great excitement about having the freedom to roam the school and take pictures by the end of the course once they have learned how to alter and manipulate digital images i have to tear them away from the computer screen because they are so involved with the magic of their digital darkroom digital imaging gives students the opportunity to be incredibly imaginative and continually explore and reinvent their world you can see examples of their work at wwwwyckoffschoolsorg eisenhower teachers olejarz digitalimaging indexhtml harold olejarz tenafly nj
 a closing notice was posted again earlier this week at the apollo theater for george c wolfe 's harlem song a musical that tells the cultural and social history of harlem over the past century the previous week though had been the best since its summer opening according to john schreiber the lead producer and he remains optimistic that the show will continue its run as planned until dec 31 talks go on with potential backers about the 300000 the production needs to ensure that future the closing of harlem song would be a disappointment for the group of visionaries who wanted it to be an entertaining 90 minutes of music and dance that tell the story of african american and hispanic migrants to northern manhattan of course it 's a commercial venture but it 's one with as one supporter put it a nonprofit sensibility one of the producers goals was to give people from elsewhere a reason to visit harlem see its revitalization including the 13 million facelift of the apollo and sample its restaurants and other attractions they seem to be accomplishing some of those goals even though the theater has not always been as full as they had hoped it has been a boon to harlem 's new generation of high end restaurants and has certainly expanded some tourists vision of how far new york 's theater district extends unfortunately one thing theatergoers are also discovering is the validity of harlem residents longtime complaints about the difficulty of getting a cab with limited money for marketing producers have depended in large part on the willingness of a group of some 200 volunteers to spread the word about the show and to encourage group ticket sales despite its identification in harlem song 's program as one of the production 's sponsors and promotional partners this newspaper is neither a limited joint marketing project never went beyond preliminary discussions the volunteers efforts are paying off in advance ticket sales for the holiday season money that would have to be refunded if immediate cash needs were n't met and harlem song had to close early if that happened it would be a setback to efforts to eliminate boundaries real and imagined in manhattan 's cultural landscape

bomb mr padilla an obscure maintenance man and hotel worker was largely forgotten by everyone but his family here why and how he ended up in a navy brig accused of conspiring with the world 's most

qureshi said i said the company policy was not to discuss religion i told him he could go to the yellow pages or telephone book to find information on his own he went to a local mosque and converted mr qureshi said it does not take a long time about 10 seconds and he was given a muslim name randomly picked it was ibrahim ms stultz also converted taking the name marwah she continued to work at the

with his arm around the shoulders of another student in the group the teacher shown in the photograph mufti hassan now 75 said he could not remember the names of any of the students because he was only filling in but he did remember the kaffiyeh he said because it was so rare to see anyone wearing one in this country during the mid 1990 's mr padilla was also attending the masjid al iman mosque in sunrise which provides muslim religious volunteers to the county jail sheriff ken jenne of broward county told reporters this week that mr padilla had registered as a roman catholic when he entered

others would give the foundation 2 1 2 percent of their earnings at other times they gave what they could when the foundation 's assets were frozen he said he was very upset i suggested that the president send his own people to disperse the fund to widows and orphans mr qureshi said nonetheless 9 11 forces all of us to think about it where was this money going to the poor or to hamas or hezbollah mr padilla 's own politics in his years after converting and even his residence are unclear when his wife filed for divorce in january 2001 she said that they had separated in december 1998

 martin brodeur dropped his black duffel bag on the wooden podium in the dressing room but instead it clunked onto his right foot he had been shrugging off questions about possible injuries to explain in part an unimpressive four goal night brodeur laughed joking that he was not sure how dropping the bag would affect him saturday in game 7 of the stanley cup finals in denver as usual he was light hearted but still understood the gravity of the situation the devils put themselves in by losing game 6 4 0 tonight it 's disappointing when you miss a chance to win you yourself put yourself in jeopardy of not winning at all brodeur said we put ourselves in position where we have two cracks at it so if we miss the opportunity hopefully we can take advantage of it the next time there is no other time brodeur stopped 14 of 18 shots and denied that a shot he took to the blocker pad from his teammate colin white in practice this morning had any effect on his play nothing serious he said no no i was fine he said he absorbed a hard shot to his right hip by defenseman rob blake in the second period and he was knocked on his shoulder on a 2 on 1 break later but brodeur offered few excuses or much in the way of an apology either they just got a few fortunate bounces a few that found the net and went in the devils captain scott stevens said marty will bounce back in the beginning brodeur had little to do but stay back in goal and admire his teammates crisp passes and their ferocious assault on patrick roy while roy was turning aside 12 shots nine from three power plays brodeur stopped the only three shots the avalanche had taken in the first 18 minutes two seconds later the avalanche had a 1 0 lead the first step to survival and the momentum whiplashed back to colorado defenseman adam foote had scored just three goals during the regular season but he scored his third goal of the playoffs when he pounced on a turnover from scott gomez carried just past the blue line and blasted a slap shot i lost it a little bit and it went off my pad brodeur said simply with that it seemed the game slipped from the devils at 6 minutes 59 seconds of the first period gomez had a goal disallowed when it was ruled he kicked the puck into the net after the devils failed on the power plays they lost their urgency all the power plays we missed early in the game made us break a rhythm about playing a hard nosed game brodeur said they were n't getting great chances but from there they got some bounces and controlled the game at the 2 26 mark in the second period the avs were on a power play with bobby holik in the penalty box for roughing foote fed martin skoula who wristed the puck from just inside the blue line and ville nieminen tipped it in past brodeur it looked like it was going wide but he tipped it and it went through my legs brodeur said it 's a hard situation when you get behind the eight ball and you try to recover and you make more mistakes and that 's what happened brodeur had suffered his worst night since game 1 the 5 0 drubbing even in that game he stopped 25 of 30 shots brodeur at times looked uncomfortable tonight after he let in the second goal brodeur made an easy save and the crowd cheered in mock admiration you ca n't blame him ken daneyko said we did n't get any goals to help him out brodeur had little chance on the third goal when chris drury rendered an artistic splicing and dicing of two defenders colin white and brian rafalski the fourth goal came with less than seven minutes remaining in the game the final ignominy alex tanguay rifled a slap shot two inches to the left of brodeur 's glove brodeur was a split second too late to make a stab but the game had already been decided during a a series in which only one goalie has played a near perfect game opposite the other round 6 went unanimously to roy he earned his record 19th career playoff shutout and his record tying fourth of these playoffs brodeur also has posted four shutouts this postseason but none in the finals brodeur earned his first star of the game of this postseason in game 5 when he turned aside 22 of 23 shots tonight however he blanched in comparison to roy his mentor every time one team gets momentum it looks like with the matchup it 's always one team going at one time and not both but i 'm sure that will change for game 7 we 'll both be fighting hard brodeur said
 the political battle between gov george e pataki and tom golisano ratcheted up a few notches yesterday as a state court judge knocked one of mr golisano 's running mates off the ballot and mr golisano asked the manhattan district attorney to investigate mr pataki 's campaign for voter registration fraud mr golisano 's campaign had taken the unusual step of supporting two candidates for lieutenant governor on two minor party lines his choice for the independence party was william nield his conservative party selection was daniel f mahony jr the lieutenant governor mary o donohue filed suit in state supreme court in albany this month asking that the petitions to get both of mr golisano 's running mates on the ballot be invalidated because they were permeated with fraud yesterday justice thomas w keegan upheld mr nield 's right to be on the independence ballot but rejected mr mahony 's candidacy because he did not have enough valid signatures although mr golisano had said he would appeal an unfavorable decision in federal court experts say he would be unlikely to prevail at the same time yesterday mr golisano took the offensive against mr pataki by calling on the manhattan district attorney robert m morgenthau to investigate what he said was a systematic effort to stack the independence party rolls with nonexistent voters through the filing of fraudulent registrations joseph gentili the deputy director of the city 's board of elections said that since last thursday the board had received about 18000 new registrations mostly for the independence party of which 10 to 30 percent have had serious inconsistencies some as reported yesterday in the daily news and newsday were plainly bogus using names of notorious criminals or fictional characters mr pataki 's campaign as part of its efforts to register voters in the independence party had hired workers who were paid incentives based on the number of people registered a method mr pataki 's opponents say that by its nature would furnish ineligible or unreliable voters at a meeting of the board this week the democratic commissioners pressed to refer the matter to mr morgenthau 's office for a criminal investigation but the republican commissioners voted the idea down instead mr gentili said board workers will try to ferret out invalid registrations before proceeding

 somewhere beneath the murky surface of the toledo bend reservoir may be the answers nasa needs a l harper lives 10 steps from the water and was outside the moment the sky turned black with smoke and debris splashed down like belly flopping fish something 's down there mr harper said i can feel it over the last five days the town of hemphill population 1106 has been transformed into a bustling anxious depot of space shuttle debris and the center of a big mystery the hope that a significant clue to the columbia disaster is lying on the bottom of the reservoir here or in the nearby brush has drawn more than more than 500 military personnel to this woodsy outpost a few miles from the louisiana border that is the largest concentration of resources in any debris zone the nose cone and parts of the landing gear were found in hemphill 's forests along with many human remains and residents said they saw objects as big as cars plunge into the reservoir a few days ago searchers in army helicopters spotted several large pieces of wreckage shining on the bottom then the rains came and flooded the 65 mile long reservoir that straddles the texas louisiana border and turned already silty waters into chocolatey darkness we ca n't see much said marq webb an official with the united states forest service sonar readings tell us something is on the bottom but we have n't found it yet maybe it is the cabin the tailfin crucial chunks of the left wing locals have their own theories which they swap at places like fat fred 's home of the 315 steak sandwich it had to be something major to send a plume of water shooting into the sky said jim schneider who also lives along toledo bend those nasa guys will find it they got all that fancy equipment hemphill residents have welcomed the newcomers like long lost cousins more than 200 families have opened their homes to the scientists state troopers soldiers and volunteers who now outnumber the local population george ann ferguson woke up one night and found a policeman stumbling through the graveyard behind her house i was as lost as a goose in a snowstorm said lonnie davis the state trooper who is from houston 200 miles to the southwest ms ferguson promptly took him in brought out a tray of biscuits and gave mr davis a warm place to sleep before the grueling search through the thorny woods the next morning today a platoon of national guard soldiers walked shoulder to shoulder through the slanting rain dozens of humvees and camouflaged transport trucks lined the roads it looked like a military drill or a war meanwhile in stoplight free downtown hemphill nasa scientists catalogued recent finds including several tiles strips of seared titanium and a spaceship window with glass still in it some of the heavier stuff landed there said a nasa spokesman doug peterson now we want to find everything the rain and chilly weather have complicated things the blackhawk helicopters that were used to scan the waters and the woods have been grounded the divers beached the shifts shortened the crews out there are cold wet and miserable said mr webb the forest service officer who spends his days in a damp muddy trailer yesterday texas authorities announced that they were granting a temporary amnesty to give anyone who plundered space shuttle debris a chance to bring it back this came after two people were arrested in nearby nacogdoches and charged with stealing government property for reportedly walking off with shuttle fragments federal agents have repeatedly warned people not to pick up any of the thousands of pieces that rained down on them on saturday in nacogdoches county officials announced today that 17 people had come forward with shuttle fragments that they had taken here and across east texas officials are searching especially hard for a device that handled communications between the shuttle and earth instructions given to the search teams showed a box marked secret government property the debris zone continues to widen residents of seven counties west of dallas are now being asked to look for shuttle material and report its locations to the authorities thousands of pieces have been retrieved including the nose cone sections of the fuselage seats harnesses clothes a shoe windows a rocket engine fuel tanks and countless strips of scorched metal remains from all seven astronauts killed on board the columbia have been identified yet after more than five days crucial objects like data recorders and wing pieces were still missing we do not have any red tag items ron d dittemore the shuttle program manager said in hemphill it seems as if like the whole town is involved in the debris hunt one way or the other the vfw has been turned into a feeding hall lined with chips volumes of water chili dogs and cake this is where volunteers meet before they stomp off into the soggy woods don iles the city manager explained we see it as our job to make sure no one leaves saying they were treated wrong in hemphill texas mr iles said the fire station is the command center men in ponchos guard the door you looked good on tv last night one woman driving a buick yelled to one of the sentinels outside nowhere is the activity more focused than around toledo bend the largest manmade body of water in the south an angler 's paradise it covers 185000 acres and it reaches 100 feet deep according to nasa scientists the shuttle ripped apart right over the reservoir earlier in the week when the weather was good police boats plied the waters looking for debris with sonar and an underwater camera though 625 pieces of debris have been found in the woods around hemphill not a single one was found in the reservoir mr harper a retired oil worker is not hopeful pure muck he said of the bottom you throw an engine block down there and you 'll never see it and then there are the alligators though it is a little cold for them they are still out there mr harper said many of them
 a very californian thing has happened in the election campaign for governor of california former mayor richard riordan of los angeles the early favorite to win the republican nomination looks as if he might be upset in the primary election on tuesday by an inexperienced conservative who is believed to have little chance of winning in november some describe the election as a test of whether republican moderates can succeed in california politics as well as a test of whether president bush made the right choice in deciding to promote mr riordan 's candidacy actually it is a test of whether predictions are possible in california politics mr riordan must have looked like a sure winner to the white house which went out of its way last year to recruit him he surely thought of himself as a winner until recently he spent most of his time attacking the incumbent gray davis who is unpopular and is seen as having bungled energy and budget crises mr davis has also failed to erase the image of terrorism show off that he acquired when he warned of attacks on the state 's bridges even as federal officials called his fears uncorroborated among professionals mr davis is considered one of the country 's most prodigious fund raisers he has n't even given his enron money back he has already spent nearly 8 million for ads attacking mr riordan clearly hoping to influence republican primary voters the governor thinks he has a better chance of defeating mr riordan 's main opponent bill simon jr a wealthy conservative son of the former treasury secretary one ad quotes former gov george deukmejian a republican attacking mr riordan for alleged lack of character mr deukmejian still has not forgiven mr riordan for giving money to his democratic opponent years ago even for california the situation is bizarre a democratic governor paying for ads featuring attacks by a former republican governor on a republican candidate for governor on the ground that he gave money to democrats with mr riordan engaged in a last ditch fight handicapping the race is risky but already some people are saying that if he loses his biggest mistake will not turn out to be that he portrayed himself as a moderate rather it is that he snubbed his conservative base viewed the nomination as an entitlement and displayed only a casual knowledge of the state he also did not reckon on mr simon being a reasonably articulate vigorous and attractive candidate mr davis however could turn out to have made an even bigger mistake no sitting governor has ever tried so hard to influence a primary election in the opposing party since the 1960 's back then gov edmund g pat brown desperately wanted the gop to nominate the most conservative candidate so he attacked the moderate candidate relentlessly even before the primary sure enough the conservative ended up winning that race his name was ronald reagan he did rather well the following november and a few novembers after that

 graciela iturbide parrish art museum 25 job 's lane southampton to jan 7 631 283 2118 sociological themes with a marked political thrust and imaginative experiments with composition and form are dual passions for graciela iturbide the widely admired mexican photographer whose touring retrospective exhibition is now at the parrish art museum many striking examples of both pursuits give the presentation a strong emotional and visual impact ms iturbide 's dedication to portraying indigenous mexican peoples which she has been doing since the early stages of her career in the 1970 's continues an important tradition yet the intensity of her images removes her projects from what once might have been termed cultural documentation and makes them seem more of an effort to insist on identity and to do it with compelling urgency titled images of the spirit the retrospective frequently depicts mystical practices blending with everyday life included are rituals involving death angels and devotional beliefs the portraits magnolia with a face reflected in a hand held mirror and na marcelina with its central figure flanked by iconic images are among the photographs showing votive materials the work is highly concentrated and uses the sharp focus silhouetting radical simplification and dramatic light contrasts possible with black and white film the artistry lends tremendous energy to the documentation ms iturbide 's editorial eye produces pieces that seem to blur distinctions between subjectivity and objectivity giving everything a further edge perhaps more than most photography retrospectives this one has a noticeably varied pace attention alternates between photographs that represent a fleeting instant and those that appear carefully planned individual pieces can be visually gripping but there are series too that provide topical breadth to a specific theme 'picturing architecture wallace gallery suny college at old westbury to dec 13 516 876 3056 well conceived and offering a number of ideas to ponder at greater length picturing architecture from space to place invites close readings and broadens understanding of the sometimes subtle messages contained in photographs of buildings starting with the assumption that all architectural images contain references to space and place the show highlights various interpretations there are photographs that interrupt a direct response to space by inserting a narrative and perhaps triggering a psychological reaction for example others might employ historical connotations that produce an adjustment to the understanding of place selections represent 11 american and european artists active during the past century the range is from eugene atget whose iconlike photograph of an ornate zoological theater connotes paris circa 1900 to lucinda devlin 's penitentiary electric chair in a white box of a room to ezra stoller 's landmark airline terminal images that celebrate the abstract properties of curving architectural components caitlin masley 's photograph of a ceiling light fixture against a soft field of color is the show 's most recent piece and one of the most compelling removed from its full context the image seems to vibrate in haunting space setting up a slow sequence of perceptual sensations and inviting imaginary ideas about location time and memory are involved too in andrew bordwin 's house viewed from an angle so casual as to seem like a random recollection then printed on absorbent paper to create the blur associated with distant experiences in addition to the atget and stoller photographs the exhibition also includes works by bernd and hilla becher that are widely appreciated as classics their black and white stark image of a blast furnace with ladders pipes and wires presenting a gridlike design has the character of a cool schematic composition of powerful forms detached from their functional connotation paper money filderman gallery hofstra museum hempstead to dec 22 516 463 5672 idealism and a considerable amount of symbolism characterize the images adorning the nation 's early currency using dozens of examples particularly the notes issued by banks chartered by state legislatures fine art and paper money in jacksonian america 1820 1860 is a thought provoking exhibition that demonstrates how the designs expressed the social motivations of the time photographic enlargements beside each piece and extensive identification labels make the presentation seem like a history lesson in economics and free enterprise capitalism designs could be stiff and crisp particularly in the case of the 18th century woodblock engravings that introduce the survey to today 's eye the straightforward linear simplicity and the rhythmic schemes created as borders have much merit more fluidity and finesse is evident in the mid 19th century steel engraving a number of major artists including asher b durand and henry inman were engaged for this work and they contributed imaginative richly nuanced scenes apparently the artistry of the notes helped to promote the new country abroad as leo hershkowitz and theodore cohen guest curators suggest in the accompanying catalog the show 's organization emphasizes links between the art and the ideas and sentiments of the jacksonian era a section devoted to farming activities underscores the nobility in working the land productively an especially vigorous and detailed image appears on an 1864 note issued by the o paddock company 's bank in watertown ny other sections demonstrate national pride in industrial and transportation achievements grand accomplishments in railroad building lent themselves well to pictorial themes in the shipbuilding category there is a strong message in a depiction of a paddle wheel steamer speedily passing conventional sailing vessels laborers in all occupations and those who journeyed to settle the western territories are celebrated as might be expected the

 to the editor fox news moves from the margins to the mainstream by alex s jones week in review dec 1 correctly suggested that i found fox news channel 's reporting on the middle east and terrorism to be fairer than other tv networks' but i do not believe that fox is fairer or better on all international reporting specifically compared with cnn or any other network what concerned me about the coverage of the middle east and terrorism by cnn and most other networks was their allowing many anti united states government and anti israeli claims to be aired virtually unchallenged or unexamined it also seems to me that cnn is making a major and strong journalistic effort to deal with these problems leslie h gelb president council on foreign relations new york dec 10 2002
 age triumphed over relative youth unsurprisingly enough when the new york city ballet presented a diamond project revival by kevin o'day and repertory staples by jerome robbins and george balanchine on tuesday night at the new york state theater mr o'day 's viola alone created in 1994 is steeped in the shifting edginess and near serenity of its hindemith score for viola and piano the ballet consists of a series of solos and duets danced here by alexander ritter and jeroen hofmans dressed stylishly in what look like old fashioned boxers trunks and jennie somogyi and carrie lee riggins in short close fitting tunics all designed by holly hynes mr o'day blends cramped jabs with freer stage covering travel to intriguing effect in choreography danced by mr ritter and ms riggins who almost steals the show in one fierce solo statelier more resolved dancing is reserved for ms somogyi and mr hofmans you soon begin to wonder however about the point of it all as the audience cough meter rises to about an 8 out of 10 the ballet 's clever full title viola alone with one exception suggests the problem mr o'day has concentrated more on cerebral conceit than on expression the dancers sit from time to time on three chairs at the back the score is played onstage by maureen gallagher the viola soloist who joins nancy mcdill the piano soloist after a curtain raises to reveal ms mcdill the dancers partnering superficially resembles the skewed limbs and off kilter body shapes found in some choreography by peter martins there are oblique suggestions of a narrative in viola alone and in robbins 's opus 19 the dreamer an equally edgy ballet set to a slightly more mellow prokofiev score but emotions push to the surface in the robbins ballet especially as it was performed by peter boal and jenifer ringer lead dancers whose every move conveyed distillations of pain angry confusion or a hunger for connection it is much harder to care about mr o'day 's two couples either emotionally or in terms of formal values the prokofiev score was conducted by maurice kaplow with guillermo figueroa as the violin soloist balanchine 's sweeping vienna waltzes ended the evening with a flurry of exciting performances best of all was mr boal buoyant and amusing in the fruhlingsstimmen section and more treasurable with every new season alexandra ansanelli was his piquant beautifully nuanced ballerina helene alexopoulos stood out for her tantalizing world weariness as the merry widow of the gold und silber walzer section kathleen tracey was infectiously goofy in explosions polka in a lead cast completed by monique meunier robert lyon kipling houston charles askegard darci kistler and philip neal hugo fiorato conducted the score of waltzes by johann strauss ii franz lehar and richard strauss
 the boards of south african breweries and the philip morris companies met separately today to vote on an agreement that would allow south african breweries to buy two thirds of the miller brewing company for about 3 billion in stock people close to the companies said south african breweries is expected to announce the deal along with its full year financial results before the market opens in london on thursday these people said under the agreement south african breweries which has its headquarters here and whose shares are listed on the london stock exchange will also assume 2 billion in miller brewing debt the deal is the latest sign of the changes reshaping the global brewing business faced with stagnating beer consumption in the united states and western europe brewers have been acquiring rival companies in efforts to keep growing the recent consolidation has made giants of anheuser busch of st louis interbrew of belgium and heineken of the netherlands by contrast south african breweries the producer of castle lager and pilsner urquell has focused on the faster growing but riskier markets of africa china and eastern europe that strategy analysts said has left the company dangerously exposed to fluctuations in the value of the south african rand buying miller based in milwaukee would ease that problem analysts said while also giving south african breweries access to america one of the world 's biggest beer markets the acquisition would allow the company to leapfrog rivals including interbrew and heineken to become the second largest brewer behind anheuser busch it is currently the fifth largest worldwide for philip morris analysts said the deal will allow it to retain a stake in the combined company while focusing its resources on kraft foods and its tobacco businesses where the returns are likely to be higher philip morris 's influence in the merged company would include voting rights and the ability to nominate three nonexecutive directors the people close to the companies said philip morris would not be allowed to sell its roughly 34 percent stake for several years these people said john bowlin the chief executive of miller brewing and other top managers are expected to continue running miller the people said because the businesses do not overlap in any significant way job losses are expected to be minimal cost savings would be relatively modest these people said totaling perhaps 50 million to 75 million the global beer industry is undergoing such dramatic change that miller can no longer continue doing business as usual said thomas a russo a partner with gardner russo gardner a money management firm in lancaster pa that holds philip morris stock the deal gives sab global scale and access to the most profitable beer market in the world he said but it will be a clear challenge for them to try and improve miller in the face of anheuser busch indeed miller genuine draft and miller lite remain distant seconds to anheuser busch 's stable of brands including budweiser bud lite and michelob some analysts have questioned whether south african breweries with its lack of experience in the united states can succeed where a marketing powerhouse like philip morris has essentially failed at the least the company will gain a valuable distribution network it can use to bolster sales of its existing brands including pilsner urquell from the czech republic one of the few beers south african breweries exports to the united states it remains to be seen how miller will fare overseas if south african breweries decides to export the beer though it could be a refreshing change from some local brews like chibuku a kind of beer similar to a lumpy yogurt shake with alcohol that south african breweries sells in zambia and some nearby nations the deal represents a drastic shift for the company which was founded in 1895 to quench the thirst of gold and diamond miners it grew to dominate its home market but was locked out of international expansion in the apartheid years by the early 90 's when apartheid collapsed most markets in developed countries were saturated with competition the deal also closes a chapter for philip morris which has spent several years seeking a buyer for miller one of its weaker assets in a portfolio of brands that includes marlboro and maxwell house philip morris considered merging miller last year with south african breweries and britain 's largest brewer scottish and newcastle but the deal fell apart when scottish and newcastle balked at philip morris 's insistence that it retain a large stake philip morris and south african breweries began talking again earlier this year and the discussions turned serious toward the end of march j p morgan chase advised south african breweries dresdner kleinwort wasserstein and lehman brothers advised philip morris

 after a summer of worsening news from iraq it is time to rethink america 's postwar strategy president bush is right to refuse to be pushed by guerrilla violence and political pressure into leaving iraq prematurely but avoiding that will require more than proclaiming victory over a tyrant who remains at large and asking americans to remain resolute against terrorism as mr bush did most recently in a campaign commercial of a speech on friday at fort stewart in georgia mr bush has so far failed to explain satisfactorily how he plans to secure iraq without a crippling indefinite american military commitment speedily achieve iraqi self government and share the burden of rebuilding iraq 's industries and society so the united states can leave on its own terms and his maneuvering room may soon shrink since the democratic challengers are desperate to break out of the herd on iraq if mr bush does not demonstrate a clear and convincing strategy soon he may face political pressure to bring home american troops under conditions that would be embarrassing for america and perilous for the middle east of all the possible scenarios the most important one to avoid is a poll driven scramble to bring the troops home that suffers the same lack of preparation the administration showed at the end of major combat moving forward will require new thinking from an administration that has shown little inclination to learn from its mistakes the united states needs help from its allies in europe but those countries are unlikely to provide it unless mr bush abandons his my way or the highway approach simply saying it 's time to pay up as mr bush did last sunday does not begin to address the concerns of economically stressed allies who felt trampled before the war the lingering strains were evident on friday in geneva where secretary of state colin powell quickly rejected france 's proposal for an unrealistically rapid buildup to iraqi elections in the spring the administration is going to have to tackle the controversy over security the arithmetic on this point is disturbing there are now roughly 180000 american troops in iraq and kuwait some 20000 of them from army reserve and national guard units defense secretary donald rumsfeld insists no more american troops are needed the violence makes us wonder about that but it 's not clear how long the american military can sustain even the present strains of occupying iraq sixteen of the army 's 33 combat brigades are now there and five more are on other foreign assignments the remaining 12 are needed for rotation in iraq or standby duty related to north korea the army is considering back to back combat tours for the first time since vietnam the reserves are stretched to the breaking point some units have been mobilized since shortly after the sept 11 terrorist attacks last week tens of thousands of reservists learned that their tours were being extended into next year yet it is hard to see relief mr rumsfeld places great hope in an iraqi takeover of security that would indeed be the best option but it 's tough to imagine that he can quickly orchestrate the leap from what is little more than about 40000 newly minted policemen to the kind of modern army needed to fight terrorism and washington will need to do something about its intelligence to weed out old regime loyalists and other unreliable elements in the shorter run if washington softens its stubborn resistance to broader un involvement peacekeeping troops from countries like pakistan india turkey and egypt could be useful unfortunately that shift can not really get under way until things become a lot less dangerous than they are right now besides the american military the only other forces potent enough to help make that happen are those of some western european countries the most optimistic assessment of what the united states could expect from these modest sized militaries many of them with commitments elsewhere is probably about 30000 additional troops the other critical key to an exit strategy is to adopt a faster timetable for restoring iraqi self government that will require the united states which lacks middle east experts and arabic speakers in its policy making ranks to win support from iraq 's majority shiite muslim population some of whose leaders have already denounced mr bush 's democratization vision washington must do so without alienating the minority sunni muslims who represent a major security threat to the occupation forces to accomplish this delicate feat the administration should consider working quietly with iraq 's neighbors like iran and syria finally getting help with the huge cost of rebuilding iraq will mean sharing lucrative reconstruction and oil contracts with foreign companies even though that means less of the pie for well connected american companies like halliburton once headed by vice president dick cheney one wild card is that while administration officials like to refer to the post saddam era saddam hussein apparently is still alive and still a political threat capturing or killing mr hussein would be a major victory for the president but we hope that he would not use it as a distraction from the bigger picture the american people will face up to their responsibilities not to leave iraq a broken and dangerous mess but only if mr bush presents a workable plan with its full financial and human costs honestly acknowledged
 new york philharmonic avery fisher hall with titles like ruhe meine seele peace my soul and wiegenlied lullaby the richard strauss songs that opened the philharmonic 's program on thursday night seemed a plea for a kind of respite that was not to be forthcoming for the songs performed by barbara bonney were followed by mahler 's weighty sixth symphony in which glimpses of pastoral romantic peace and strauss 's brand of sweet sentimentality are tempered by the fixity of an unblinking gaze beyond them into the void christoph eschenbach plunged into the program headlong sometimes to judge from sloppy entrances like the one that opened ruhe meine seele before the orchestra was fully ready there 's nothing ponderous about mr eschenbach 's mahler he whipped the symphony 's marches along with a tight raw energy and generally kept the bite in the piece from the sarcastic old fashioned passages in the scherzo which he invoked with an urbane touch of humor through to a bitter muffled end when the music closes as if stifled with a pillow the orchestra 's uneven performance was perhaps not entirely his fault the philharmonic can play wonderfully bringing off exposed passages like handoffs from one instrumental section to another then it turns around and gets sloppy with the horns or lurches through some of the dotted rhythms or goes muddy in big ensemble sections the overall effect was stirring but this sixth was a diamond in the rough ms bonney 's voice also evokes a diamond 's hardness with its smooth planes and angles and she too was rough in the strauss songs tinkering with the vowels of individual syllables working hard to create the right effect she 's at her best when she sings most simply and her own voice can come through coming through over a full orchestra was part of the problem and led to some of her manufactured exaggeration like overacting in ruhe meine seele to snarl the word wild with an artificial almost burlesque emphasis anne midgette
 it 's not easy to hide a restaurant smack dab in the middle of midtown but i defy anyone to summon up a mental picture of 41st street between madison and park avenues better yet thanks to several double crosses perpetrated by the one way traffic system i 'm sure i could get rich betting motorists that they ca n't get there on the first try the reason to take the trouble is virot a new restaurant in the equally new dylan hotel didier virot formerly the executive chef at jojo and sous chef at jean georges has set up shop in what once was the ballroom of the chemists club a doubly perplexing spot who knew that chemists had a club or that they gave balls it 's a quirky place for a restaurant but mr virot may be just the chef for it he 's inventive with an antic streak he takes risks some of them do n't pay off but diners will not leave virot feeling that they 've had an ordinary meal mr virot starts with a main ingredient indicated in big boldface type on the menu and treats it like a star he has an admirable sense of proportion never letting his supporting cast of flavors and ingredients take over the stage ruby colored slices of tuna marinated with cucumber and coriander take on the lightest possible layering of spice and green freshness fresh horseradish in sheep 's milk yogurt gives a subtle kick to the flavors like the quick twist of the projectionist 's lens that brings a film into sharp focus feather light gnocchi in a rich emulsion of black truffles and cream melt on the tongue with textural contrast provided by slices of jerusalem artichoke another pleasing little touch is the addition of toasted almonds to vegetable soup with a small island of peekytoe crab in the center big fat shrimp cooked to a light outer crisp on a skewer with some basil leaves work one of those minor miracles encountered more often in print than in restaurants they remind you of what shrimp used to taste like mr virot does not get in their way he applies a light saffron mustard dressing and piles a little salad of baby zucchini and radicchio on the side when mr virot slips there 's no mistaking it chanterelle tart with hazelnut spread is heavy and unappealing his foie gras terrine with artichoke and rutabaga barely registers on the palate it 's so muted and the cornmeal crisp that comes with it seems to have hopped on the plate from some other dish or even another restaurant absolutely first rate squab dark and livery never quite works out a livable relationship with the intriguing sounding oatmeal porcini cake i support the idea of an oatmeal porcini cake and i 'm glad that mr virot gave it a try but the thing itself has an unpleasantly slippery texture it feels as if it should be good for you which is a bad sign a much happier experiment in the same line is the cake of basmati rice that accompanies a magnificent lobster sauteed with cardamom and bathed with a caramel ginger sauce the rice cake is essence of crunch on the outside creamy on the inside an appropriately bland riposte to the subtle asian spicing that reflects the chef 's years with jean georges vongerichten mr virot has an eye as well as a palate he serves his main dishes on enormous nubbly square plates mustard yellow and cucumber green that recall the heroic ashtrays of a bygone era roasted black sea bass in a meaty olive sauce picks up a lovely splash of color from burgundy carrots braised in butter and meyer lemon juice and it 's as much a matter of eye appeal as anything else that brings long strands of pale yellow wax beans to a neat arrangement of three brick red lamb chops and sweet couscous dotted with black and golden raisins gorgeously spiced with turmeric cinnamon and cardamom and then shaped into a neat cupcake the lamb chop triad parts to reveal alas a rather tough hunk of lamb shank virot 's pastry chef jehangir metha who has worked at jean georges and union pacific is a good fit he has a daring streak that suits mr virot 's menu he also has a sense of adventure that leads him to some very strange places my vote for the most challenging dessert in new york a title previously held by the picholine olive poundcake at aleutia now goes to the terminally strange dish billed as a salty caramel tapioca tart salt slime and a mango topping that keeps sliding off the tapioca are the main features of this truly memorable dessert but the weird tart shares menu space with a demure flawless flat cake made from ricotta cheese and roasted pineapple with a scoop of tart concentrated pineapple sorbet and with an awesomely dense almond creme brulee sprinkled with jujube chutney jewellike cubes of candied red date slowly cooked with cinnamon anise and pepper and drizzled with walnut oil mr mehta 's hazelnut souffle is pure intensely flavored and classic service is a little hushed and reverential at virot and the style can be traced directly to the chill formal room with its 24 foot ceilings and odd sense of stillness there 's an impressive monumentality to the old chemists ballroom that makes virot feel like the waiting room in a grand old train station upstairs a treasure awaits the balcony lounge it 's dark and intimate and for the moment at least it feels like a secret hideaway the best place to get lost in new york in other words is a block from grand central do n't tell anyone virot rating two

 a brooklyn judge yesterday allowed into evidence the confession of a man who said that he killed amy watkins a 26 year old graduate student as she walked home from the subway one night in the brooklyn neighborhood of prospect heights the judge 's decision came as jury selection started in the trial of the man david jamison last week lawyers for the defense and the prosecution sparred over whether mr jamison 's confession contained in a statement he gave to the police on the day of his arrest was properly obtained in writing and on videotape mr jamison 28 admitted to fatally stabbing ms watkins on march 8 1999 i pull out the knife from my right back pocket the statement says i pulled on her pocketbook and she jumped like and backed up into the knife ruling from the bench justice michael r juviler of state supreme court in brooklyn said that both the written and recorded statements could be used as evidence he found that mr jamison had been adequately informed of his rights before talking to the police the trial which should begin in earnest on wednesday with opening arguments will hinge on mr jamison 's statement there were no witnesses to the stabbing and there is little forensic evidence mr jamison 's co defendant felix rodriguez 21 will stand trial in the killing directly after mr jamison 's trial the watkins killing touched a raw nerve among new yorkers who were getting used to lower crime rates and a feeling that the city had slowly become a safer place to live
 to the editor re governors end port authority rift that blocked billions in projects front page june 2 it is welcome news that gov george e pataki of new york and gov christine todd whitman of new jersey will allow several important regional transportation projects to proceed it is unfortunate that one of the outcomes of their agreement is the commissioning of a study that will likely recommend a path fare increase rather than shortsightedly view the 1 path fare as a new jersey subsidy new york politicians should instead recognize it as an incentive for workers to contribute to new york city 's economy without flooding the hudson river crossings and city streets with more traffic william o yates new york june 2 2000
 it has been another outstanding field hockey season for westchester high schools some of which are now on the long playoff trail north salem a traditional small school class c power had an undefeated regular season beating and tying strong class a teams from schools with more than 800 students along the way lakeland successfully made the move up to class a and despite heavy graduation losses suffered only one regular season defeat john jay made the same move and lost only twice scarsdale lost four times but won its fourth straight league title rye was so dominant that its goalie went games without making a save greeley absorbed the rare occurrence of a boy david woolf joining what is usually an all girls sport legal in a reverse title ix application and had a fine winning season also in section 1 putnam valley made a success of its first varsity season indeed section 1 field hockey is as good as it gets in new york state if not the nation last year of the four state titles in the sport two went to section 1 teams with another of them a runner up similar success this month would not be surprising but in westchester it may never be quite this good again the overall level of play may not be quite this high or countywide team depth quite so impressive five westchester high schools john jay irvington new rochelle greeley and rye neck are moving their girls soccer programs to the fall next year so they can compete for state titles the remaining three dozen schools playing girls soccer in the spring can not north salem will make the switch the next year new rochelle does not have a field hockey team but at the other schools it means that girls proficient in both sports can no longer play both at the varsity level field hockey the less major of the two is likely to suffer more this will affect a lot of young women said liz ferrara the co coach of john jay field hockey field hockey and soccer they 're almost the same sport though one 's with a stick the strategies are the same both are low scoring girls who play one of them often play the other ferrara counts six on her team who plan to play varsity soccer this spring next fall they will have to choose between two sports they love she said henry sassone north salem 's athletic director has similar concerns will field hockey be affected absolutely he said that 's why we are doing this gradually moving developmental soccer to the fall this year jayvee next year and then varsity you will not have so many seventh and eighth graders raised in both having to choose but i foresee our field hockey level going down at least for a few years artie mccormack irvington 's athletic director worries what the glut of soccer games will do to the understaffed officiating ranks we already have a lot of developmental and jayvee games without a single official he said he also worries about field availability with another sport crowding the fall schedule perhaps the strongest field hockey program in section 1 is at lakeland a perennial power it is keeping girls soccer in the spring but coach sharon sarsen who notched her 300th field hockey victory in the first round of the playoffs this week fears for her sport i do think field hockey will take a hit she said girls do n't usually get involved in it until the seventh or eighth grade in our modified program by then the decision has been made many of those young women have been involved with soccer for years dennis robinson lakeland 's athletic director has similar views we have a modified program a jayvee squad and coaches who put in a lot of time he said but there is little grassroots stuff as with soccer and in our area we have soccer winter spring and summer it 's not just a seasonal sport kara adnopoz a sophomore at greeley is among the girls who will have to choose between sports she started for hough 's field hockey team this season and plans to do likewise for the soccer varsity in the spring next fall at this time i 'm undecided she said it 's a tough decision

 to the editor re bush links europe 's ban on bio crops with hunger news article may 22 president bush says that genetically modified crops will help feed hungry people in poor nations that 's nonsense there is no scientific evidence that genetically modified foods are cheaper safer better tasting or more nutritious lacking consumer benefits for its genetically modified crops the biotech industry is desperately seeking moral legitimacy under the guise of humanitarian aid the bush administration is force feeding high tech proprietary seeds that are neither affordable nor relevant to most poor farmers some african countries have refused genetically modified food aid because of health trade and environmental concerns the true beneficiary of mr bush 's promotional efforts are not poor people but some of the world 's largest agrochemical and seed corporations like monsanto whose genetically modified seed technology accounted for more than 90 percent of the total worldwide area devoted to genetically modified crops last year when the root of the problem is poverty and inequality technology is never the silver bullet solution hope shand chapel hill nc may 22 2003 the writer is research director of the etc group a nonprofit advocacy organization
 as the presidential contest heads toward the showdowns in iowa and new hampshire the battle to control congress is shaping up with considerably less attention from the public that is understandable since only about 30 of the 435 campaigns for house seats are expected to be close yet even in this early phase the congressional election offers some important clues about the public mood and the hopes and fears of party leaders democrats convinced they have a good chance of recapturing the house plan a series of confrontations this year on health care education and other issues house republicans the onetime revolutionaries are trying to soften their contentious image last week they even dropped their tried and true strategy of pushing sweeping tax cuts as the centerpiece of their electoral approach in years past the congressional republicans tried to outdo themselves each new year with more and more extravagant tax cuts they apparently have recognized that at a time of extraordinary prosperity and in spite of looming budget surpluses tax cuts take a back seat among voters to more long term concerns like health care retirement security and education speaker dennis hastert 's latest proposal for 135 billion worth of tax cuts over the next 10 years is only about a tenth of the tax cut promoted by gov george bush of texas the front runner for the republican presidential nomination could it be that republican lawmakers are more attuned to the wishes of voters than the texas governor it would not be the first time that mr bush and the house republicans have differed on what the voters want when the republicans recaptured the house in 1994 they had one of the greatest political opportunities of a generation to solidify their reputation as a party that could govern they squandered it with their petulant government shutdowns extremist agenda and the ethical problems of speaker newt gingrich the impeachment drive of 1998 hurt them almost as much as it hurt president clinton mr gingrich forced to resign as speaker was not even invited to attend a recent celebration of the contract with america he founded no matter how well the gop candidate does in the presidential race republicans may not be able to improve much on their razor thin margin in the house most of the vacant seats up for grabs this year are held by republicans many of them in districts carried by president clinton this has fed the democrats hopes they believe they have recruited good candidates done well in fund raising and even better in forging their message in the senate republicans are likely to retain control but there are thought to be more vulnerable republican incumbents than democrats no matter who controls congress the margins will probably be small this means that in 2001 congress and the new president will face something that gets left out of election year rhetoric the necessity of bipartisanship presidential candidates like to talk about bold initiatives but neither democratic health care reform nor republican tax cuts stand much change unless someone reaches across the aisle it could be that at a time of contentiousness among candidates the electorate is once again signaling a desire for a different kind of congress one in which the two sides try to work together and to get along
 it is pleasantly incongruous to see sunflowers and rings of millet hanging as seasonal decorations from a 14 foot colorado spruce outdoors at longwood gardens in kennett square pa and at winterthur in delaware a 16 foot douglas fir indoors in the conservatory is decked out with dried flowers from the winterthur gardens both are inspirations but my favorite is the one that feeds the birds at longwood gardens as i watched the birds dive into orange cups filled with sunflower seeds i started making a mental list for next year 's garden i would have to plant millet indian corn sorghum and barley i would have to grow sunflowers safflowers and red cockscombs silvery pods of nigella or love in a mist and then have the patience to dry them you could grow about 80 percent of this in your garden said lois lawton who keeps the longwood tree brimming with food for wildlife one year i used grapevines to lash big sunflowers around the trunk and it looked like a beehive this year she used fruit from the garden including native crab apples strung on florist wire and hung like christmas balls and slices of golden quince which caught the light like stained glass she got other edible ornaments from the local supermarket raisins strung on waxed dental floss cranberries tucked into the round holes of dried lotus pods carved out oranges full of seeds and halved fresh coconut birds love coconut ms lawton said they eat the flesh and then we pack the shells with suet she warned against pure peanut butter which can lead to birds choking in cold weather so her pine cones are stuffed with a combination of peanut butter cornmeal and beef fat she also hangs whole oranges like balls with deep slits cut through the rinds orioles love to peck out the flesh she said count on a tree loaded with these treats to attract those orioles along with cedar waxwings dark eyed juncos eastern towhees purple finches catbirds flickers mockingbirds nuthatches ruby crowned kinglets sparrows woodpeckers and even the yellow bellied sapsucker but watch out with those orange cups i get dive bombed by the chickadees when i refill them ms lawton said longwood 's other observations of christmas can be seen at wwwlongwoodgardensorg i drove down route 52 to winterthur the henry francis du pont estate where the 16 foot high douglas fir reminded me of an ornate dutch painting we start collecting daffodils in the spring and then we take a lot of flowers from the cutting gardens said bonnie a beck who has been heading this dried flower operation for 14 years the trick is to dry flowers in their prime some can simply be hung upside down in a dark dry room flowers that dry well this way include larkspur delphinium cockscomb hydrangea limonium lavender yarrow safflower echinops statice artemisia salvia crocosmia queen anne 's lace globe amaranth eryngium and goldenrod but flowers with a higher moisture content like roses lilies dahlias zinnias and peonies wo n't dry that way mrs beck preserves hers in airtight boxes filled with silica gel a desiccant or you can use a mix of one part borax to one part cornmeal which has the same effect how long to leave flowers in the box depends on the thickness of the petals drying could take five days to a week if it 's crispy it 's done she said if it 's not put it back in the box you ca n't leave it in too long once the flowers are dry she stores them in airtight boxes with a little silica gel blue silica gel turns pink when it absorbs moisture but you can dry it out again in a 350 degree oven drying flowers is explained in flower arranging the winterthur way by alberta a melloy winterthur 1795 published this fall and available at wwwwinterthurorg then there 's the art of assembling the flowers on the tree starting from the top down she suggests using a tree like the douglas fir which has branches relatively close together everything has to be wired to the tree and colors do not always dry true to their hue any blue red flower dries to dark and purple mrs beck said so if you want a red you have to start with an orange flower and white can dry and look dirty no member of the composite or daisy family looks very good though coneflowers do n't fare too badly and imagine trying to wire butter and eggs to a branch it boggles the mind i do n't think i 'm suited for this kind of fussy detail work but a tree for birds that i can tackle
