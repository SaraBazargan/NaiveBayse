ted cottrell the jets defensive coordinator was sure he could detect signs of progress even though the starters were consigned to the sideline thursday night in the final preseason game against the philadelphia eagles after all he reasoned if the backups who played the entire game were making the correct calls and adjustments it had to bode well for the starters so goes the preseason a time of crossed fingers and plenty of questions after a preseason that seemed to go on forever and yet did not have enough time for the starters on either side of the ball to get into a groove the coaching staff gathered yesterday to decide which 19 players to cut the eagles game provided plenty of fodder for the debate over which players would remain but nothing on how ready the starters were after five games in which the starting quarterback took 21 snaps the starting running back averaged 14 yards a carry and the starting defense was last seen in a game in which it gave up a 21 play 95 yard touchdown drive who knows what conclusions can be drawn last year the jets were ebullient over a 4 0 preseason only to crash to a 2 5 start they finished this preseason 3 2 i think the concern i have is that when you start the season you wonder about everything coach herman edwards said yesterday you 've got a thousand concerns i want to make sure we run the ball can we stop the run you worry about everything there seem to be three key issues confronting the jets as they begin to prepare for their opener at the washington redskins on thursday night quarterback the jets plan to use a seamless preseason to avoid a slow start was thrown a curve when their starting quarterback chad pennington injured his left wrist he is expected to be out at least three months vinny testaverde along with the rest of the starters did not play against the eagles he also did not play against the tampa bay buccaneers or the new orleans saints leaving open the question of how rusty he will be testaverde practiced only once a day during camp so he is plenty fresh but his only significant time with the first team came in one game testaverde said he would rely on his experience to prepare on such a tight schedule suggesting that even he thinks he has not had enough work the offensive coordinator paul hackett and edwards agree that it could take a few weeks before the offense establishes the rhythm it had with pennington when you 're on a particular track to do things a particular way and then you have to go sideways you regroup and you set sail in a different direction hackett said it 's going to take some time in the beginning of the season some time with him getting his rhythm with the guys at the speed we 'll be playing at running game the jets have not run the ball well curtis martin coming off a season in which he had two badly sprained ankles had only 14 carries in the preseason and occasionally looked hesitant as he hit the hole the running game is especially critical because the jets want to keep the pressure off testaverde when testaverde had success in 2001 the jets used a conservative run heavy offense and they could revert to that while he becomes comfortable do i think we ca n't run the ball no edwards said i 'd like to have seen more it never transpired now it 's going to have to transpire defense in their last appearance against the giants the defensive starters gave up 231 yards in the first half and allowed the giants to convert 6 of 9 third downs the kind of clock eating numbers the jets can not afford to surrender if they are to give their offense enough plays to find a rhythm the offense will be under the gun cottrell said and we have to take some of the pressure off them until vinny gets rolling and comfortable extra points coach herman edwards said the jets might still have interest in the former jets safety victor green who is a free agent but green 's agent nate lampley said he had not heard from the jets yesterday quarterback chad pennington is expected to rejoin the jets tomorrow edwards played down the idea that the jets would install the shotgun although it is possible they could use it to allow pennington to return earlier from his wrist injury the shotgun would soften the blow to his left hand when the ball is snapped brooks bollinger knee is expected to be the backup quarterback against the redskins linebacker marvin jones hamstring is expected to start only cornerback andrew davison ankle is questionable for thursday
