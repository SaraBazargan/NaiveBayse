to the editor re study sets off debate over mammograms value front page dec 9 it will be a tragedy if even one woman cancels or does not schedule her mammogram appointment because of the lancet study i went to only my second ever mammogram two weeks ago because i had turned 40 i received a diagnosis of breast cancer last week there was no palpable lump only some irregularities on the mammogram that my radiologist and surgeon caught my treatment will be mild compared with that of women who receive the diagnosis once a lump is felt and has had time to spread statistics are irrelevant when you are the one whose life has been saved by a simple painless mammogram jeanette kuvin oren woodbridge conn dec 11 2001
