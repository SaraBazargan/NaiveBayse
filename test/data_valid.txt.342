poverty in the united states became far less concentrated in the 1990 's as public housing projects were torn down and millions of poor people left urban slums for other neighborhoods a new study of census bureau data says the number of people living in high poverty neighborhoods declined by 25 million or 24 percent to 79 million in 2000 from 104 million in 1990 the researchers said the author of the study paul a jargowsky an associate professor of political economy at the university of texas at dallas described this as a significant turnaround from the 1970 1990 period during which the population in high poverty neighborhoods doubled in 1990 15 percent of all poor people lived in high poverty neighborhoods by 2000 the proportion had declined to 10 percent according to the study issued today by the brookings institution concentrated poverty the share of the poor living in high poverty neighborhoods declined among all racial and ethnic groups especially african americans mr jargowsky said in 1990 30 percent of poor blacks lived in high poverty neighborhoods ten years later the proportion was 19 percent mr jargowsky said the changes were generally beneficial concentrations of poor people lead to a concentration of the social ills that cause or are caused by poverty mr jargowsky said school districts are often organized geographically so the residential concentration of the poor frequently results in low performing schools the census bureau has not issued any studies on the concentration of poverty based on the 2000 census but mr jargowsky used census data to analyze high poverty neighborhoods which he defined as those where at least 40 percent of the residents had incomes below the official poverty level a family of four was classified as poor in 2000 if it had cash income less than 17603 the study defined a neighborhood as a census tract the population of tracts varies widely but averages 4000 people the number of high poverty census tracts declined to 2510 in 2000 from 3417 in 1990 mr jargowsky said the economy was expanding for most of the 1990 's but that alone does not explain what mr jargowsky described as the deconcentration of poverty despite the strong economy the number of people classified as poor in the 2000 census was slightly higher than the number counted a decade earlier bruce katz director of the center on urban and metropolitan policy at the brookings institution said the decline in concentrated poverty represents in part the triumph of smart federal policies that demolished failed public housing rewarded work and overhauled welfare a separate study by g thomas kingsley and kathryn l s pettit of the urban institute found that conditions in high poverty neighborhoods generally improved in the 1990 's adult education levels rose the share of families headed by women declined and the number of households receiving public assistance fell sharply the study said margery a turner a researcher at the urban institute said the findings showed that improvements are possible even in severely distressed neighborhoods in his study mr jargowsky reported these findings the number of blacks living in high poverty neighborhoods declined by more than one third to 31 million in 2000 from 49 million in 1990 two regions accounted for most of the change in the concentration of poverty the population of high poverty neighborhoods declined by 16 million people or 35 percent in the south and by 12 million people or 46 percent in the midwest in the northeast the population of high poverty neighborhoods was virtually unchanged in the west it increased by 344000 or 26 percent from 1990 to 2000 the number of people living in high poverty neighborhoods fell by 313000 or 74 percent in detroit by 177900 or 43 percent in chicago and by 107000 or 70 percent in san antonio but poverty remained highly concentrated in the new york metropolitan area mr jargowsky said the population of high poverty neighborhoods there declined only 15000 or 16 percent he said across the country mr jargowsky found a bull 's eye pattern improvements in the central city and increasing poverty in the inner ring of suburbs poverty increased in older suburbs of detroit chicago cleveland and dallas he said trends in the west were dominated by california which showed a large increase in the population of high poverty neighborhoods one reason mr jargowsky suggested was the influx of low income latin americans such poverty though cause for concern may be different from poverty elsewhere he said western inner city barrios may be more of a gateway than inner city ghettos in other areas of the country mr jargowsky said immigrants are moving into the barrios for opportunity as part of an assimilation process that may channel many of them into jobs
