the accepted theory of why a piece of foam broke off the shuttle columbia 's external fuel tank presumably inflicting the fatal damage to its left wing is hokum the chairman of the investigating board said today the assertion by the chairman harold w gehman jr a retired admiral added to a growing sense that nasa still did not understand the operation of the shuttle fleet well enough to ensure that future flights would be safe investigators said admiral gehman agreed with another board member dr douglas d osherhoff a physicist who challenged the prevailing theory that the foam broke off the liquid fuel tank in a process involving condensation and boiling after air slipped beneath the foam the two spoke in a briefing in which investigators said they had found new problems on an unrelated part called a bolt catcher that they had previously identified as potentially dangerous none of the new problems change the working theory of why the shuttle was destroyed on re entry on feb 1 that insulating foam broke off shortly after liftoff creating damage that allowed superhot gas to flow through the wing on re entry panel members said that before shuttle flights could resume it was critical to determine exactly why the foam broke even though the part that shed the foam the bipod ramp will probably be stripped of foam on the next mission other areas routinely shed smaller pieces of foam that hit the orbiter the news about bolt catchers is also disturbing the investigators said the devices are supposed to protect the shuttle from bolts that connect the solid rocket boosters to the external fuel tank the bolts hold explosive charges that detonate about two minutes after liftoff to shed the boosters and for months the investigators have said they could not eliminate the possibility that a bolt fragment had hit the orbiter nasa had a new supplier for the columbia bolt catchers and after the crash tests showed that they failed at a much lower pressure than expected said maj gen john l barry of the air force admiral gehman said that investigators had gone back to look at quality assurance records and that those records have us scratching our heads some postmanufacture examination of the welds was apparently skipped he said investigators publicly singled out the bolt catchers as a potential problem in april and they join a list of factors that the board is having trouble ruling out those include damage to wing panels from previous flights or from improper handling on the ground or misinstallation of a panel investigators had said they believed that foam fell off the bipod ramp through a mechanism called cryopumping in which nitrogen from air slipped in through flaws in the foam and was condensed into a liquid on the outside of the cold tank as the shuttle was launched and accelerated the theory went the liquid was boiled back into a gas expanding and breaking off chunks of foam but dr osheroff determined that an expanding gas would create a crack perpendicular to the surface of the foam like a crack in a sheet of ice not like a bubble in bad paint thus the gas would escape without throwing off foam dr osheroff said besides he added the rushing air had barely had time to start raising the temperature of the foam exterior which would be essential to boil the nitrogen this alone can not cause the ejection of foam he said on wednesday the nasa administrator sean o'keefe said he hoped that the three surviving shuttles could resume flying by december admiral gehman said today that the requirements for a first flight might be lower than the long term requirements flights to the international space station he said might be safer because if a shuttle sustained liftoff damage the station itself was a safe haven where repairs or rescue might be possible but he said much of what nasa had to do involved its management which would take longer in addition to giving a progress briefing its first in washington where the board is relocating to settle down to writing its report the panel held a hearing with aerospace contracting experts and budget specialists russell d turner former president and chief executive of the united space alliance the main shuttle operations contractor said that contractors had put safety first and that his company had cut its potential bonus by adding to safety spending mr turner said united space was well aware that foam debris was damaging the orbiter on every launching but that the foam was from the external tank the province of another contractor dr osheroff with no evident humor called that very funny united space he noted is partly owned by lockheed martin which produces the external tanks correction june 18 2003 wednesday a diagram on friday with an article about new safety questions raised by the panel investigating the loss of the space shuttle columbia showed an incorrect orientation for bolts that connect the craft 's solid rocket boosters to its external fuel tank the bolt is vertical not horizontal
