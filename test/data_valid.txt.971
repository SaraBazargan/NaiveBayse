nine years after the persian gulf war saddam hussein remains a menace to american interests in the middle east seeing gov george w bush flanked recently at his ranch by two architects of the war effort dick cheney and gen colin powell was a piquant reminder that washington has unfinished business in iraq one of the first tests awaiting mr bush or vice president al gore will be to devise a policy that keeps mr hussein in check even as other nations like russia and france press to end iraq 's isolation mr hussein continues to defy united nations peace terms by blocking international weapons inspections he chips away at the economic sanctions meant to keep him from rebuilding his arsenal of biological and chemical weapons and to prevent him from developing nuclear weapons last week he closed the tap on the 23 million barrels a day of oil that baghdad exports when consuming nations rejected his demand for a 50 cent a barrel surcharge over un administered prices he relented yesterday the surcharge would have been paid directly into the iraqi treasury where it could have been used to pay for new weapons with global oil supplies tight any sustained iraqi cutoff would further inflate prices that are already painfully high and could even create an oil shortage for over a year the clinton administration has deliberately downplayed problems with iraq it hoped to avoid a new military showdown at a time when international unity was frayed and feared that another round of inconclusive airstrikes against iraqi military and industrial targets might have complicated mr gore 's presidential campaign iraq used this period to try to extricate itself from international monitoring and economic pressure when the security council passed a compromise resolution last december that would have offered some promise of relief from sanctions in exchange for the return of un weapons inspectors baghdad rejected it and the resolution has never been put into effect an increasing number of countries have resumed civilian flights into baghdad ignoring a un ban iraq is preparing to use russia 's presidency of the security council this month to seek a further loosening of sanctions and financial controls while whittling down inspection requirements washington needs to deflect these new pressures and reinvigorate its own policies even before the next administration takes office america 's guiding goals should be to keep iraq from threatening its neighbors and the flow of oil to the west by making clear that any future iraqi aggression would be unacceptable to this end washington must work with security council members to maintain and if necessary tighten sanctions so long as baghdad refuses to accept inspections america should be prepared to use airstrikes against selected targets if there is hard intelligence that these sites are being used to manufacture new unconventional weapons mr hussein badly lost the persian gulf war but he has not given up on winning the peace
