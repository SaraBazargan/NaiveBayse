to the editor comforts of home yield to tyranny of digital gizmos front page april 28 reminded me of a theater experience i had at the last moment before the beginning of a play last week a friend seated next to me tried to find the right menu selection for choosing the vibrate mode on her cellphone she thought she 'd found it so i did n't worry about the cellphone during the first half of the play but during intermission her phone proved her wrong by warbling in its usual way after that she again tried in vain to find the right menu selection before the lights dimmed because of an ailing parent she did n't want to turn the phone off i understood the worthy cause but my concern about the phone 's potential perturbing effect kept me from fully enjoying the play fortunately the phone did n't ring during the play but the experience reinforced my belief that the beast we call technology turns us into narcissistic automatons as it leads us down the primrose path of increased convenience david w trulock austin tex april 28 2002
