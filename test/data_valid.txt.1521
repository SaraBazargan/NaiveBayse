israeli leaders proclaimed today that the death of president hafez al assad of syria had ushered in a new era or at least ushered out an old one in the middle east but no one could predict what that portended beyond a potentially problematic transition period there was no mourning no celebration of the death and no reassessment here of an arab leader familiar to generations of israelis as a sworn enemy of their state yet one who inspired sometimes ambivalent feelings as a cunning leader and a worthy adversary too still most agreed with nahum barnea the dean of newspaper columnists who wrote this morning we israelis have no reason to shed any tears over the death of hafez assad it 's a waste of water many israelis expressed the hope that positive change would prove inevitable assad 's successor is the times and not any one man said shimon peres israel 's minister for regional affairs because if his successor does n't adapt himself to the times syria will remain a very poor and isolated country in a very difficult situation some worried that syria would degenerate into chaos which could destabilize lebanon and spread violence into israel but more said wishfully that mr assad 's death could help syria shed its insularity open up to the west and perhaps even lose what is perceived here as its intransigence in peace negotiations they also noted hopefully that mr assad 's designated successor his 34 year old son bashar was educated in england that he heads syria 's computer society and that he is not bound by the same personal entanglements in history syria with his father as defense minister lost the golan heights to israel in 1967 reflecting the calm here the tel aviv stock exchange usually a good barometer of geopolitical anxiety registered barely a flutter israel 's military after a 24 hour alert reported quiet on the northern borders we 're looking on the other side and everything looks as usual a senior official said our military estimation is that the regime will focus internally on stabilizing itself we do n't think that the death of assad will stimulate the area or light any fire mr assad 's death almost certainly puts regional peace talks on the back burner until bashar assad if he is indeed made the new leader wins over the political and military establishment calms ethnic tensions and grows into his authority for all his hostility mr assad did preserve peace on the border with the golan heights for most of his rule but although he had made what he considered a strategic choice to pursue peace he was the oldest hard line skeptic in the region and many here said again hopefully that the absence of his ideological dominance in the arab world could shift the tenor of debate it could also they added make it easier for yasir arafat the palestinian leader to make a final deal with israel without being accused of selling out palestinian and israeli negotiators are to resume talks in the united states this week assad personally was a cloud hanging over the possibility of reaching a reasonable arrangement in the region said shlomo ben ami israel 's security minister and senior negotiator with the palestinians several right wing leaders used the occasion to promote their belief that there are grave risks in pursuing peace with aging leaders in an unstable region zalman shoval a former ambassador to the united states and now the spokesman for the rightist likud party wrote today in the jerusalem post that mr assad 's death underlines just how unreasonable was israel 's headlong rush into negotiations with syria in his cabinet meeting today prime minister ehud barak criticized this line of thinking noting that peace lasted with other arab countries like egypt even after the death of the peacemaker he also agreed with diplomatic analysts who noted today that it was a good thing that israel had withdrawn its troops from lebanon before mr assad died pulling out now the original withdrawal date was july 7 would have been complicated by the uncertainty for decades mr assad 's face on banners hovered over damascus here less explicitly it had become part of the scenery too life without hafez after all these years is an unknown and we will all have to go through a weaning period chemi shalev wrote in the newspaper maariv but along with the worry there is also room for hope after all assad was a bitter enemy who cast a giant shadow over the entire middle east this morning now that he 's gone we can see the sun once more even if it is blinding at present
