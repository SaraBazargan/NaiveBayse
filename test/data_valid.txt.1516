most good universities have at least one conservative professor on campus when for example some group at harvard wants to hold a panel discussion on some political matter it can bring out the political theorist harvey mansfield to hold up the rightward end at princeton it 's robert george at yale it 's donald kagan these dissenters lead interesting lives but there 's one circumstance that causes true anguish when a bright conservative student comes to them and says he or she is thinking about pursuing an academic career in the humanities or social sciences this is one of the most difficult things says alan kors a rare conservative at penn one is desperate to see people of independent mind willing to enter the academic world on the other hand it is simply the case they will be entering hostile and discriminatory territory here 's what i 'm thinking when an outstanding kid comes in says george of princeton if the kid applies to one of the top graduate schools he 's likely to be not admitted say he gets past that first screen he 's going to face pressure to conform or he 'll be the victim of discrimination it 's a lot harder to hide then than it was as an undergrad but say he gets through he 's going to run into intense discrimination trying to find a job but say he lands a tenure track job he 'll run into even more intense discrimination because the establishment gets more concerned the closer you get to the golden ring by the time you come up for tenure you 're in your mid 30 's with a spouse and a couple of kids it 's the worst time to be uncertain about your career can i really take the responsibility of advising a kid to take these kinds of risks the most common advice conservative students get is to keep their views in the closet will inboden was working on a master 's degree in us history at yale when a liberal professor pulled him aside after class and said you 're one of the best students i 've got and you could have an outstanding career but i have to caution you hiring committees are loath to hire political conservatives you 've got to be really quiet conservative professors emphasize that most discrimination is not conscious a person who voted for president bush may be viewed as an oddity but the main problem in finding a job is that the sorts of subjects a conservative is likely to investigate say diplomatic or military history do not excite hiring committees professors are interested in the subjects they are already pursuing and in a horrible job market it is easy to toss out applications from people who are doing something different as a result faculties skew overwhelmingly to the left students often have no contact with adult conservatives and many develop cartoonish impressions of how 40 percent of the country thinks hundreds of conservatives with phd 's end up working in republican administrations in think tanks and at magazines often with some regrets teaching is this really splendid thing it would be great to teach plato 's 'republic says gary rosen a harvard phd who works at commentary magazine despite all this george advises his best and toughest students to go ahead we need to send our best soldiers into battle even though we 're going to lose a few he says i hate to tell kids they should n't take risks they should n't go for their dreams others say it is possible to have a satisfying career and do good work if you learn not to fly straight into the prevailing ideology conservatives are people who teach the value of prudence but are incapable of exercising any says mark lilla a politically unclassifiable professor at the university of chicago and jacob t levy a libertarian also at chicago says some conservatives exaggerate the level of hostility they face some politicized humanities departments may be closed to them he concedes but professors in other fields are open to argument if it were my kid i 'd say go to graduate school read the books you want to read then go to washington where you wo n't feel embattled because you 'll exchange ideas with liberals and others in a more intellectually diverse setting you 'll probably end up doing more good last week the professors at harvard 's government department reviewed the placement records of last year 's doctoral students two had not been able to find academic jobs both of them mansfield 's students well mansfield quipped i guess they 'll have to go to washington and run the country e mail dabrooks nytimescom
