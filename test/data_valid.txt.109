conservatives condemned and liberals applauded the court decision today denying elian gonzalez an asylum hearing while the two politicians most prominently seeking support in the political center vice president al gore and gov george w bush of texas temporized senator robert c smith republican of new hampshire called it a sad judgment and a tragedy for this little boy robert w edgar general secretary of the national council of churches said our only disappointment is that it did n't happen earlier but neither mr bush nor mr gore would say whether they thought the decision was good or bad mr gore said that it should be respected but that he had always believed a florida family court should have dealt with the case mr bush said that he agreed and that mr gore should now persuade attorney general janet reno to send the case there ms reno made it clear that she had no such plans saying i think justice has been done each presidential hopeful had reasons for hedging conservative republicans who had demanded an investigation and hearings when elian the 6 year old cuban boy was forceably taken from the house of his great uncle on april 22 quickly retreated when it was clear the public supported the government action and mr gore 's split with the administration was widely condemned in his own party as pandering to cuban american voters in florida but there is another level at which the decision defies ideological pigeonholing while the result disappoints conservatives like mr smith and representative tom delay of texas the majority whip it is a statement of judicial restraint a staple conservative principle at least 11 times the opinion by judge j l edmondson of the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit suggested that the immigration and naturalization service might have made wrong decisions in the case but judge edmondson wrote it was not the job of judges to overturn the policy selected by the ins merely because we personally might have chosen another the opinion in language that could come from any republican platform of the last 20 years concluded it is the duty of the congress and of the executive branch to exercise political will although courts should not be unquestioning we should respect the other branches policy making powers the judicial power is a limited power it is the duty of the judicial branch not to exercise political will but only to render judgment under the law liberals pleasure at the result was tempered by just that element of deference because many important immigration cases challenge deportations and seek to require courts to oversee ins decisions to a degree this opinion clearly bars howard simon executive director of the american civil liberties union of florida said the decision was not surprising this mr simon said is the consequence of congress giving so much discretion to the immigration service and the department of justice a degree of discretion the aclu found excessive when the 1996 immigration act denied judicial review to aliens the ins found deportable t alexander aleinikoff professor of law at the georgetown university law school praised the decision for reaching a proper standard of judicial review of administrative decisions by the executive branch but professor aleinikoff said we seem to always go further in immigration cases where there is an extra dose of deference that is given he said the court probably went further than this case demanded in emphasizing how immigration policy affected the president 's conduct of our nation 's international affairs while most of the political reaction today focused on the result of the decision and not its legal logic mr delay cited due process elian gonzalez should at a minimum have his case for asylum fully heard and objectively considered he said senator patrick j leahy democrat of vermont said the court correctly found that the ins acted within its discretion in deciding that it is the role of parents to care for and make decisions for their young children in all but the rarest circumstances
