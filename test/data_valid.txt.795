founded in 1914 the montclair art museum new jersey 's first is well known for its collection of american and native american art but these days it looks more like a hard hat zone than a residence for american masterpieces extension cords snake through dimly lighted halls exposed wood studs poke out of holes in sheetrock bags of cement lie stacked among the equipment of tradesmen the din of power tools shatters the air and the walls are as bare as a freshly stretched canvas one day last month patterson sims the museum 's new director picked his way through all this like a father checking on the progress of his young child the museum is in the last stages of an ambitious 145 million construction and renovation project which will double its space mr sims who took over his post in mid september after a nationwide search had little to do with the fund raising for and design and building of a new 20000 square foot wing but he will shepherd this dramatically reborn showcase into the new century the museum 's original building an l shaped structure of cream colored brick sits on bloomfield avenue and south mountain avenue in montclair 's center the new wing is being built on land that the museum already owned construction of the wing began last june the original building closed this june for renovations with all the art put in storage until the work is completed the reopening is scheduled in phases the wing will open first with a reception for museum members on nov 17 and a preview of primal visions albert bierstadt 'discovers america which is to run through feb 3 2002 also on display will be selections from the collection of paintings by george inness 1825 94 the landscape painter who lived in montclair when it was a thriving art colony the museum is especially rich in works by inness and bierstadt on nov 18 the new wing and these exhibitions will be open to the public the original building is scheduled to reopen in the spring mr sims who previously was a deputy director at the modern museum of art in manhattan had spent years admiring the museum from afar i knew the collection very well from reproductions but not from actually coming here he said so when i was informed that there might be some interest in having me be a candidate for this position i obviously came out when i visited the first time i was n't impressed because it was during the construction and everything was a big mudhole basically but i knew the collection respected the collection and had seen works from it over the years in traveling exhibitions since he began his new post he said every day has been a revelation at last count the museum 's holdings number some 15000 pieces with works from the hudson river school and by andy warhol and about 4000 native american baskets clothing weavings jewelry ceramics and paintings many of the native american items have been in storage because of lack of space now more will be able to come out of hiding and a new two story atrium in the addition will likely become the setting for concerts lectures and films mr sims said the museum can be the community resource that it is meant to be mr sims said my hope is even though the museum is only showing american art it can still reflect a diversity of interests and diversity of needs in a region as interesting and engaging as the montclair region mr sims said his goals included making the new building an active stage for the community he hopes to raise 185 million toward an endowment so the museum can better preserve and restore pieces in the collection and extend its existing programs of art classes children 's workshops lectures and other events as well as mount serious traveling exhibitions mr sims who turns 54 on nov 17 the day of the reopening for members grew up in philadelphia he inherited a passion for art from his great aunt a trustee of the philadelphia museum and a collector of modern art she had an ability to discover artists early in their career and an amazing eye he said adding that among others she owned works by warhol mark rothko jackson pollock willem de kooning piet mondrian constantin brancusi alexander calder paul klee and henry moore it was a fantastic collection as a child mr sims began dabbling in painting under the tutelage of an inspirational art teacher he suffered from dyslexia and battled learning problems in school a situation that would dog him well into high school and college but art offered a safe haven by age 14 thanks to visits to the philadelphia museum of art the boy learned a magical word curator and abandoned his own artistic ambitions it was very fixed in my mind that i wanted to be a curator and the moment i knew i wanted to become a curator i stopped making my art he recalled because i began to think like a curator and realized that i was making very modest art the art had no real quality to it as an appreciator of art i was forced to take an objective view of my own art it was n't awful but it was modest and what was the point of being a modest artist better to focus my energies on being a good curator besides the modern mr sims worked at the seattle museum where he organized shows on de kooning and jasper johns among others he also worked at the whitney museum of american art where his responsibilities included co curating four biennial exhibitions he and his wife a graphic designer live in manhattan with their two children so each morning mr sims has a reverse commute but he does not rule out an eventual move to the montclair area i think this region is vastly interesting and i love it he said i love the different chapters of my life and i loved moving to seattle and this is like moving to seattle for me so far out of the way of my experience i 'd never been to montclair before and now i spend most of my waking moments here correction december 30 2001 sunday an article on nov 4 about the new director of the montclair art museum referred incorrectly to its holdings of paintings by albert bierstadt while the museum is indeed rich in works by george inness it owns only one work by bierstadt this correction was delayed by an editing lapse
