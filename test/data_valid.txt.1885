for the last few years zinc has been among the most interesting adventuresome and satisfying restaurants in connecticut the chef denise appel has a real feel for southwestern and asian flavors and she executes many of the well conceived dishes consistently furthermore she is a working chef i 've been to zinc about a dozen times for both lunch and dinner business and pleasure and she has always been in the open kitchen zinc is the kind of restaurant i love to hate though it 's in downtown new haven right across from the green it could be anywhere the room is pseudo trendy long and narrow with hard and dark surfaces it can be pretty noisy there are no tablecloths and the vertically bound menus are cumbersome there is a bizarre ugly amoeba like kinetic light projection along part of one of the long walls and because the other walls are mirrored it 's hard to miss the food appears to be all over the place gravlax with tamari and mirin saigon beef smoked trout with beets tiptoe rubbed lamb at first glance it could be a greatest hits menu dreamed up in a corporate headquarters little of this appeals to a restaurant reviewer who is prejudiced toward well grounded restaurants with a sense of place and a consistent identity which makes it all the more surprising how much i like zinc and how i eagerly brought my friends and family here to sample dishes i came to love the service is attentive and gracious not condescending as the place 's look would imply and the sense of identity is strong and chef driven as it is in some of the world 's best restaurants and as it is not almost anywhere else in the state it 's just not easily pinpointed ms appel has a tendency to combine flavors from different parts of the world a risky technique broadly known as fusion if she were not skilled at this zinc would be a flop because it 's the rare dish that is straightforward and authentic the saigon beef is grilled and wrapped in lettuce leaves and served with a garlicky dipping sauce this is pretty close to how it 's done in saigon but looking at the menu i did n't see another dish nor do i recall one that had a geographical home but smoked duck nachos on wonton skins with spicy aioli and lime crema make a sensational starter the gravlax with tamari is delicious jalapeno shrimp with smoked beans is right on the money the smoked beans are killer grilled chicken breast with black rice sauteed vegetables and a perfect lemon pepper dipping sauce is terrific the complex salads most of which have some cheese in them are well conceived and nicely balanced the huge cobb salad with shrimp served at lunch for 9 is dollar for dollar the best lunch i know speaking of cheese there is a good selection here and much of it is local as are many of the other ingredients including some of the meat the cheese plate is tempting but some of the other desserts nearly steal the show they are contemporary and successfully amusing german 's chocolate cakes small brownie like disks with a thick coconut icing are served with irresistible malted milk ball ice cream there is a plate of what amounts to s'mores a huge marshmallow over a pile of chocolate with dark chocolate ice cream this is too sweet for me but one of my guests devoured it banana spring roll comes with dulce de leche ice cream all of the ice creams are creamy and intensely flavored and an overkill salsa based on dates the loser in the bunch is coconut rice pudding which is underflavored although they are few there are dishes that do not work i 'm tempted to say that these are all the ones that have an italian component because that is nearly the case open faced ravioli with mesquite smoked tomatoes mushrooms greens and goat cheese is not to put too fine a point on it a mess from the perspectives of both presentation and flavor linguine with smoked salmon and ginger cream is better but it 's still not as appealing as say linguine carbonara not on the menu a dish that incorporates the smokiness ms appel so clearly favors but in a more straightforward way no matter she is playing experimenting and getting better at judging what works and what does not ninety percent of the menu is successful and a solid third a very high percentage in my experience would thrill just about anyone i say keep it up if there were a category between very good and excellent that 's where zinc would fit but it has definitely improved since being graded very good in these pages four years ago i 'm erring on the gracious side because zinc takes chances and often succeeds furthermore it 's reasonably priced with most of the entrees in the low 20s and some in the high teens enabling a party of four to eat for about 200 excluding wine these days for this quality of food and service that 's a bargain zinc 964
