you tend to take lenny wilkens for granted a player from 1960 to 1975 and a head coach since 1969 he has been in the national basketball association for so many lifetimes that he 's become like the myth of the mighty mississippi always been there goes on forever it seems no beginning no end for knicks fans wilkens became very visible too visible subtly craftily wilkens and the toronto raptors backed the knicks and jeff van gundy into a playoff corner then eliminated them 93 89 last night while the predictable knicks do the same predictable things changing only with a gun to the head wilkens adjusted on the run the raptors coach catapulted chris childs from the bench to the starting lineup yanked the rookie mo peterson to the bench and pulled the all purpose jerome junkyard dog williams from the doghouse to the starting lineup finally wilkens a nine time all star tapped into the psyche of his budding superstar vince carter and helped him exorcise his knicks demons like the sage reassuring his protege wilkens told carter that having a bad night two bad nights was something generations of superstars have shrugged off whatever wilkens said carter put it all together last night playing timely basketball for the second straight game carter was a model of efficiency he took 22 shots made 11 made all three 3 pointers and finished with 27 points when the knicks pulled to 73 71 carter nailed a 3 pointer ahead by 85 83 carter missed a shot slithered in for his rebound and scored last night 's victory was a chronicle of wilkens 's philosophy when he won the nba title with seattle in 1979 that team had superb passers as wilkens himself had been if anyone got double teamed the ball was moved the ball was gone he said yet early in this series the raptors were not responding to the double team last night toronto used smart passes to expose the weaknesses of the double team more than carter 's points his passes showed how much he had blossomed i knew the double team was coming carter said so i was just taking my time letting it happen finding the open man and making the good pass to get it to him there is a reason beyond mere longevity that wilkens has won more games than any other coach in nba history a reason beyond time on the job that he is one of only two inductees to be in the hall of fame as a player and a coach john wooden is the other a reason that wilkens is the only person ranked as one of the nba 's greatest 50 players and one of the top 10 coaches in nba history longevity does n't mean anything if you 're not winning because you ai n't going to be around wilkens said sports is different from music and all those other things because if your team do n't win you 're not going to be here regardless of what happened against toronto last night the knicks are as good as they are going to get the raptors have a very high ceiling they have no idea how high up can be every year you come across some young players who just get you going wilkens said it 's been fun coaching vince but even more so when i get a young player like mo peterson who just wants to learn and grow i get a young player like alvin williams no one thought he was going to be a good player look what he 's doing now they want to be coached and that makes it fun inadvertently the knicks supplied toronto with the safety net carter needed to perform effectively against them in charles oakley and chris childs the knicks gave carter veteran players who taught a young player how to do the little things required for winning he 's a young kid he 's fragile inside childs said but that 's when you 're going to get veterans saying things in your ear referring to carter 's being challenged by oakley to step up childs explained he has to understand that oak is not going to sugarcoat anything he 's going to tell the truth the knicks do n't grow young players they import them in this climate of change they may pay dearly even before winning last night wilkens said he felt good about his young team this is the most confident i 've felt about our team when we lost the first game here everyone thought we were going to get swept i really believe that and we were n't going to let that happen we came back fired up when we lost the first game in toronto everyone said 'oh oh it 's over for them but we were n't going to let that happen you 've got to have a sense of pride about yourself
