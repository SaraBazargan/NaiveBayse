in the united states armed forces with the fatal shootings of two immigrant shopkeepers on feb 8 a different gun was used in another killing on march 1 but the police have said they believed it was also connected based on its timing and the description of the suspects the shootings all occurred in the morning and in each case the gunman shot his victim in the head and took little or no money also in each case the police say the gunman has killed even though he encountered little or no resistance from his targets yesterday 's shooting at 6 am at the 24 hour brightly lit laundry king superstore at 1384 atlantic avenue in bedford stuyvesant was similar in its apparent lack of motive the police said in front of two customers the gunman wearing a dark three quarter length coat over a

senior police official said nothing was taken from the laundry the official said this guy comes into the place with a coffee cup and he goes and sits down in the laundromat and walks back to the bathroom and comes out and shoots the guy just shoots him a second police official said describing the scene captured on the store 's security video it seems to me there is a nut out there a
