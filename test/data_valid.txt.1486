in the rolling hills of eastern missouri family planning services can be hard to come by especially if you 're poor for the last five years tina dean 39 and her daughter melissa 20 have received annual gynecological exams and breast and cervical cancer screening through a state program for uninsured low income women fees are based on their ability to pay when they visited the family planning clinic of franklin county in st clair near their hometown of catawissa this month the women paid 12 each for their annual exams and an additional 60 for a six month supply of birth control pills for melissa for the elder ms dean who is unemployed the missouri program is a godsend she estimates that without it her daughter 's birth control pills alone would have cost 500 last year more than they could afford unfortunately the state of missouri has decided that it can not afford it either to help close a 700 million budget gap the legislature eliminated the entire 5 million in state funding for the program this fiscal year all that remains is 49 million in federal family planning funds we 're trying to control the damage said susan hilton executive director of the missouri family health council which administers federal family planning funds for the state clinics are talking about sharing staff anything they can do to keep the doors open longer ms hilton who estimated that 33000 women could be affected by the budget cuts said that at least three clinics had already been shut down a study published this month by the kaiser family foundation and the national women 's law center noted that women 's access to health care has expanded in recent years an exception being abortion services for which restrictions have increased but it also suggests that women are at greater risk of losing services when economic times are tough for one thing the authors of the study said women tend to be poorer than men and more likely to have jobs that provide no health insurance they also tend to use health care services more often than men and they live longer three quarters of nursing home residents are elderly women many of them on medicaid the government program that provides health insurance for low income people according to the study when the safety net starts sprouting holes across the board changes are going to disproportionately affect women said alina salganicoff vice president and director of women 's health policy for the kaiser family foundation and one of the study 's authors seventy percent of adults receiving health coverage under medicaid are women many of them pregnant or single mothers according to the study in recent years many states expanded eligibility for medicaid to allow more pregnant women and parents to qualify for coverage and to receive extra services but that is changing last year missouri 's medicaid program reduced from two years to one year the time that 160000 new mothers could receive family planning services in addition an estimated 32000 parents lost their medicaid eligibility when the state lowered the income ceiling to qualify for the program the state just does n't have the money to spend this year said state representative carl bearden a republican from st charles and chairman of the missouri house budget committee we had to make tough decisions on what the state was going to fund and that was an optional program missouri is n't the only state enacting changes that affect low income women texas is reducing medicaid eligibility for pregnant women to 158 percent of federal poverty level from 185 percent that means the income ceiling will be 24000 for a family of three down from 28000 the move will affect about 8300 women i was shocked said leighton ku a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities in washington who has tracked the eligibility changes people hardly ever reduce eligibility for pregnant women because they want to encourage prenatal care he said arizona has also reduced eligibility for pregnant women and minnesota plans to do so in 2004 california new jersey tennessee and nebraska have lowered medicaid eligibility for low income parents and oklahoma has eliminated a program that helped many poor elderly and disabled people deal with high medical costs private insurance is no panacea for women either because they often work part time at lower wage jobs women are less likely than men to have private health insurance coverage fifty three percent of men were covered by their employers compared with just 33 percent of women according to another recent kaiser family foundation study women who are covered under their husbands policies can face problems too they sometimes lose their coverage when their husbands retire and sign up for medicare lorenza abrams 64 has been uninsured for three years since her husband retired as a shipping clerk for an electronics manufacturer she works three days a week at the queens community civic corporation near the couple 's home in flushing queens but her job there does n't offer health coverage mrs abrams has high cholesterol and high blood pressure but because she does n't have insurance she tries to stretch out her doctor visits and laboratory work to every six months instead of every three months she has decided to put off surgery she needs on her shoulder until she turns 65 next month and qualifies for medicare mrs abrams is fortunate at least she can look forward to having health insurance very soon but others are not so lucky if women do n't get the care they need now everyone may pay a price in higher costs for insurance and public health programs down the road ms hilton of the missouri family health council cautioned that the cutbacks in family planning services had yet to have their full impact the real fallout she said will happen a few years from now when birth rates and infant mortality rates start to rise money medicine michelle andrews is a freelance writer in
