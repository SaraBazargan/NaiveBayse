calendar girls is not nearly as mortifying as one of the most recent films to use the phrase based on a true story this fall 's remake of the texas chainsaw massacre though the real life story of girls is particularly horrifying to at least one person 16 year old jem john paul macleod learning that his mother chris helen mirren her best chum annie julie walters and all of her middle aged to elderly female friends are going to pose nude on a calendar to raise money for a local charity is a terrifying prospect for the boy can anything be scarier for a teenage boy at his most self conscious than learning his mom is at her most shameless and wants the whole town to know it takes the sting out of jem 's having been caught with a lads magazine featuring women with bazooka city post its affixed to their breasts girls is yet another professionally acted and staged wry crisp comedy about british modesty this one could be called how full was my monty that gets its laughs but seems increasingly out of date keep in mind that this mildly rendered social farce directed by nigel cole is set in a country where several newspapers featuring pictures of the captured saddam hussein probably also ran photos of topless babes straddling bazookas but for the sake of propriety girls set in rural yorkshire ca n't relinquish its embrace of convention or else chris would have nothing to do initially annie 's travails in a small town knapely inspire the calendar she loses her husband john john alderton a florist to cancer chris who has been enduring her friend 's plight at the hospital while perched on a lumpy couch as threadbare as many of the jokes in girls gets a noble idea she wants to raise funds for a comfortable sofa for loved ones of cancer patients both chris and annie are members of the knapely chapter of the women 's institute an organization dedicated to promoting the ideals of fun and friendship or foon and friendship as adorably pronounced here among its members the easily bored chris and the quick to giggle annie cling to each other desperate to keep straight faces during the arid lectures and demonstrations that the guest speakers drone through if more people did wi there 'd be half the need for hallucinogenic droogs chris says with a sigh ms mirren and ms walters are a graceful pair of troupers the minty cool ms mirren is like a bebop drummer who shows she can downshift into playing three chord pop changes without condescension well without its being so apparent anyway the deft ms walters keeps time for her as admirably as the bassist ron carter might and the director is sharp enough to back off and watch them work john was to be a women 's institute speaker before his death and he had a line comparing the women of yorkshire to its flowers the last stage is always the most glorious his words ring throughout the movie it 's hard for them not to since they 're repeated several times chris spotting a girlie calendar at her auto mechanic 's garage is inspired with the notion of posing nude yes sigh there is resistance from the staid institute leadership but the willful chris and devastated annie press on finding a surprisingly large number of recruits including the nervous ruth penelope wilton and the imperious but equally proud celia celia imrie the women are photographed in mundane poses from their lives like baking or tending to their gardens except that they are nude making for some of the most flavorless double entendres this side of an episode of the british sitcom are you being served their calendar becomes such a hit that they 're invited stateside by the tonight show which puts them up in rooms the size of knapely jay leno makes his monthly film appearance leading you to wonder how he finds time to do tonight even given his gargantuan stamina the film 's writers juliette towhidi and tim firth use the aging models growing fame for some sparkling comic moments they 're all stalked simultaneously by news camera crews mr cole and the cinematographer ashley rowe give knapely a lived in charm so much so that the cast seems to have played these roles already it is fun seeing ms mirren use her towering confidence which could scare paint off a wall to play and stroll through a role with a smile on her face which she does n't often get to do the mounting homicide tolls on prime suspect do n't leave much room for pleasure she and ms walters are a sunny amusing team even when there 's tension between them because chris has so immersed herself in her new celebrity that she 's ignoring jem and her calm thoughtful husband rod ciaran hinds the most likable aspect of the film is the husbands left on the sidelines and the people behind calendar girls are savvy enough not to overplay that role reversal but when the biggest compliment you can pay a picture is that it is professional and not smug there 's a little something missing like invention at least girls which opens nationwide today was made in britain if it were american it would already be spun off into a series reuniting mary tyler moore and valerie harper note to network programmers please do n't think of this as a suggestion calendar girls is rated pg 13 parents strongly cautioned it has some mildly yeasty double entendres near nudity and self consciously cute strong language calendar girls directed
