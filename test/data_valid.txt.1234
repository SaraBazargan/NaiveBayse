disagreements between the governor and legislative leaders over revenue forecasts have traditionally hindered budget negotiations in new york slowing down talks for months while every side waited to see if the tax revenue picture would improve but like everything else about the budget that historic pattern is not holding true this year as leaders here struggle with an 115 billion deficit and a stagnant economy for once the assembly and senate put out revenue forecasts today that are relatively close to the governor 's projections indeed gov george e pataki and the leaders of the assembly and senate who seldom agree on anything all agree that the state 's economy is not going to improve much over the next year neither will tax revenues our forecast i do not believe holds up anything in the budget said sheldon silver the democratic assembly speaker as he unveiled his projections if anything it brings us closer john mcardle a spokesman for senator joseph l bruno republican senate majority leader said the relatively minor differences in revenue estimates boded well for budget talks though he added that the republicans and democrats were still far apart on several issues governor pataki a republican has predicted that the state faces a 22 billion shortfall in revenues for the fiscal year that ends on march 31 and 93 billion next year the senate put out the most pessimistic projections today saying the revenues for the next 13 months will be 295 million less than the governor had predicted pushing the shortfall closer to 118 billion the assembly meanwhile is forecasting that tax revenues will come in about 189 million below the governor 's expectations this fiscal year but will rebound slightly in the next bringing in about 336 million more than mr pataki has predicted aides for the governor and legislative leaders say budget talks have progressed further this year than in previous years and some are even holding out hope that a deal can be sealed in early april the major sticking points now revolve around how to borrow more than 4 billion to help stave off extreme cuts to services and whether to restore about 12 billion in education cuts the governor has proposed the governor wants to leverage about 4 billion from a giant court settlement with tobacco companies to back bonds but mr silver has instead proposed floating general obligation bonds backed by state tax revenue arguing that they will be cheaper in the long run mr bruno supports the governor 's borrowing plan though today he said he was not ruling out mr silver 's idea mr silver has also vowed to restore proposed cuts to the education budget he has not said how he will pay for those restorations but he has not ruled out an income tax increase for the wealthy senator bruno meanwhile has also said he wants to restore some of the proposed cuts to the schools though he has not said how much
