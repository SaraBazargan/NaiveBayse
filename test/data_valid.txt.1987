jamal crawford of the chicago bulls was dribbling between his legs like a harlem globetrotter using head fakes to send charlie ward backpedaling helplessly into the paint when other knicks defenders having no choice collapsed on him crawford threw a deft pass to eddy curry who finished the play with a thunderous dunk over kurt thomas with 54 seconds remaining in tonight 's game with that one powerful move curry might have slammed the knicks playoff hopes behind crawford and curry two of chicago 's possible stars in training the bulls defeated the knicks 100 98 at the united center the loss pushed the knicks three games behind the eighth place milwaukee bucks in the fight for the final playoff berth in the eastern conference anything can happen in the wild and weak east but with 12 games left to play the knicks appear to be done we just have to keep our heads up and keep staying positive and not let it slip said allan houston who scored 19 points but missed 9 of 14 shots we just have to keep playing every second of every minute and keep fighting because you never know what 's going to happen what was supposed to happen tonight was much different after an inspiring victory over detroit on friday the knicks 31 39 entered tonight 's game against the young and struggling bulls 25 45 with a chance to move a game back of the bucks the plan disintegrated as the bulls dominated from the opening tip when milwaukee 34 36 defeated new orleans tonight it really fell apart we just did n't play well said coach don chaney whose team shot 38 percent and made only 9 of 30 3 pointers games like this we ca n't let go if we want to be in the playoff race on paper this is a game the knicks should have won but there was no doubt the bulls were the more talented team and in the united center chicago is not so green only 3 33 on the road the bulls are 22 12 at home where they have beaten the knicks five straight times the knicks are also 2 14 on the second night of back to back games crawford was outstanding only 22 he has beaten out the bulls first round draft choice jay williams for the starting point guard job crawford scored 22 points on everything from 3 pointers to how 'd he do that driving layups matched his career high with 10 assists and set a career high with 9 rebounds curry 20 was also impressive a 6 foot 11 285 pound center curry scored a career best 30 points and grabbed 9 rebounds he 's going to be a great player in this league said thomas who led the knicks with 20 points and 9 rebounds before fouling out he 's a beast down there i tell you he 's a big boy with crawford and curry showing off the bulls who shot 53 percent from the floor grabbed a first quarter lead of 12 points a second quarter lead of 14 points and leads of 11 points in the third and fourth quarters in addition to toying with the knicks defensively chicago did a great job of containing houston and latrell sprewell double teaming them when they got the ball especially in the post the bulls forced them to pass and forced the other knicks to try to beat them they could n't sprewell attempted only four shots in the first half and houston took six through three quarters but houston emerged in the fourth helping to rally the knicks from an 87 76 deficit with 6 minutes 8 seconds left houston scored 7 points down the stretch and pulled the knicks to 91 87 by sinking a 3 pointer with 3 22 left a minute later clarence weatherspoon dunked to cut the bulls lead to 93 91 and the knicks seemed poised to pull it out jalen rose sank a jumper but houston answered with a 14 foot shot with 1 23 to play a key play followed as weatherspoon stole a bad pass by rose seconds later thomas still in the backcourt was called for kicking the ball chicago assumed possession crawford beat ward and found curry for the dunk that made the score 97 93 if anything it should have been a no call because he pushed me down said thomas referring to chicago 's tyson chandler you get breaks sometimes and sometimes you do n't thomas scored on a layup with 32 seconds left to cut the deficit to 2 points again but crawford broke down ward again and this time keeping it himself scored on a driving layup with 14 seconds remaining game over playoff hopes almost over
