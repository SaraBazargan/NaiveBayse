roger clemens assured himself of a championship ring by winning the last game of the world series last fall and now with good humor he is ready to take on the role of ring architect armed with gaudy thoughts and pictures clemens arrived at yankees camp ready to lobby for something quite different manager joe torre has three sample championship rings stowed away in his right hand desk drawer and from time to time today players filtered through to ogle the dozens of diamonds the glittering yankees insignia clemens likes those rings well enough but he has an idea that is supported by derek jeter and chuck knoblauch platinum platinum for the last title of the 20th century platinum for the 25th championship maybe the yankees will settle on one or the other clemens mused today maybe they will get both styles with the platinum being the players only ring he relished the topic before the first workout of spring training for the yankees pitchers and catchers he has watched some of the videotape of his performance in game 4 and for clemens it was something of an out of body experience clemens sees himself on the screen making certain pitches in that game throwing to specific hitters but he can not draw forth his own memories of those moments everything happened so fast the concentration requirement phenomenal he does remember coming out of the game when fans at yankee stadium roared and security personnel waiting in front of the clubhouse told him that his ailing mother had left the stadium in the middle innings because the emotion had been so overwhelming he remembers the championship parade parts of it anyway but there are three days from october that run together the day the yankees won the world series and the two days that followed just incredible clemens said he essentially forced his way to the yankees last year to pursue the championship he had not experienced in his first 16 seasons in the majors the goal of playing for a world series winner has been achieved and clemens has other personal benchmarks to chase in the last years of a career that will result in his induction into the hall of fame he needs three victories for 250 in his career 53 victories to reach 300 684 strikeouts for 4000 you 're pitching for history his friend tom kite told clemens as they golfed together in the off season but clemens spoke today of winning another championship he can become a free agent after this season although many executives around baseball believe that clemens 's trade to the yankees would have never happened last year if there was not an understanding in place that would inevitably lead to a contract extension i 'm excited about having the opportunity to go after more clemens said i want to continue to contribute i still have that competitive edge clemens has a different look to him than last year a slimmer one after weeks of long distance running torre said clemens had lost weight and it is apparent though the right hander still looks bigger and thicker than most of his teammates he and david cone jogged side by side today at the end of the first workout a plow horse cone once called clemens the groin he injured in spring training last year is healthy as is the hamstring he strained torre has acknowledged that in last year 's playoff game in boston when clemens was hammered by the red sox the pitcher injured his back but chose not to say anything that might be perceived as an excuse but that does not seem to be a problem clemens is ready to go so is cone who joked that although it is a baseball cliche to say on the first day of training camp that you are in the best shape of your career he could make no such claim he wants to try to reinvent himself again develop a slower changeup i 'm continually trying to change speeds he said before smiling then again i say that every spring pitchers threw in the bullpen briefly fielded ground balls and ran while catchers went through defensive drills and then took batting practice the rest of the position players will join them in five days whatever type of ring the yankees principal owner george steinbrenner settles on torre wants a particular thought inscribed with a root word persevere or perseverance torre said referring to the 1999 season when so many yankees went through personal trials when the manager was treated for prostate cancer when the team met almost impossible expectations and when clemens came back from a trying season to pitch the clinching game of the world series inside pitch the decision on mariano rivera 's arbitration hearing will not come until saturday because two of the three arbitrators deciding the case are involved in other cases and required more time for deliberation in rivera 's case after the yankees and rivera 's representatives failed in a last minute attempt to reach an accord on a long term contract before the hearing the yankees officials argued for a salary of 725 million while rivera 's side defended its request for 925 million win or lose rivera said today he will compete the same as last year paul bell a speedy infielder from south africa worked out for the yankees staff at their minor league complex don zimmer the yankees bench coach is experiencing considerable pain eight weeks after having his knee replaced unless his condition improves he said he might not remain with the team this season his 52nd in baseball
