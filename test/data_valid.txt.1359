nikolai khabibulin tampa bay 's world class goaltender made 20 saves in the third period to become the fourth goaltender in 14 seasons to post a shutout in a period of an nhl all star game until khabibulin entered the game the other goalies on the world team detroit 's dominik hasek 10 saves and edmonton 's tommy salo 15 saves had combined to allow five goals but when eric daze was selected the most valuable player of the game even his north america teammates were shocked daze of the chicago blackhawks won the award even though his team was an 8 5 loser to the world all stars at the staples center when voting was conducted by a panel of professional hockey writers association members midway through the final period the north america team had a one goal lead but the world team scored four goals in the final 3 minutes 1 second to win the fifth game played under the current format nhl officials are discussing a return to the conference versus conference approach by next season when the game will be in sunrise fla i think it 's probably time the rangers brian leetch said he was playing in his ninth all star game there are a lot of great players out there and this format helped bring attention to the players on the world team that some fans might not know and vice versa with the north american team but i think it would be a good thing to be represented the best you can on both sides khabibulin represented both sides well today i hope i have some luck left for the rest of the year because i think i used a lot of it up today said khabibulin who will play for the russian olympic team in salt lake city because the game was played in the shadow of the coming olympics perhaps it was fitting that the stars for the north america team were two players who will not be in salt lake city daze a canadian and a first time all star shook off a cut near his right eye on his first shift he had two goals and an assist vincent damphousse of the san jose sharks playing in his first all star game in a decade scored the first goal 35 seconds into the game he also assisted on two other goals he is another canadian but with the world team trailing 5 3 entering the final period khabibulin demonstrated why his nickname is the bulin wall perhaps his most timely save came midway through the period after espen knutsen of the columbus blue jackets had scored at 7 52 to bring the world team within a goal during saturday 's skills competition jeremy roenick of the philadelphia flyers had beaten khabibulin with a marvelous move in the breakaway competition roenick and khabibulin were once teammates on the phoenix coyotes midway through the third period khabibulin snuffed a shot by roenick on a breakaway to keep the world team in the game we made a deal roenick said he let me score on him last night if i would n't score on him today he lived up to his part of the bargain sergei fedorov of the detroit red wings tied the score at 5 5 with a slap shot from the slot that beat phoenix goaltender sean burke who supplanted khabibulin as the no 1 goaltender for the coyotes at 18 17 markus naslund of the vancouver canucks scored his second goal of the game on a 3 on 0 break off a leetch turnover in his own zone for the game winning goal that pizza i served up at the end that hurt a little bit leetch said two empty net goals concluded the scoring chicago 's aleksei zhamnov had one with 478 seconds left after a brilliant move by the islanders aleksei yashin at center ice sami kapanen of carolina with just 37 seconds left also scored kapanen tipped in a shot by the devils patrik elias that was going to go in anyway elias has never scored in an all star game i ruined my weekend with that said a disconsolate kapanen who scored his first all star goal it was just a reflex if i had a second chance i would n't do it again elias who hit a post in the second period was later stopped by montreal canadiens goaltender jose theodore in the second period on what appeared to be a certain goal i guess it just was n't meant to be elias said khabibulin could be excused for feeling the same way slap shots the other three goaltenders to record a shutout in a period of an all star game are colorado 's patrick roy in 1993 when he was with montreal the devils martin brodeur in 1996 and washington 's olaf kolzig in 2000 teemu selanne of the san jose sharks scored two goals in the first period for the world team mario lemieux 's second period goal was the 13th all star goal of his career tying him with wayne gretzky
