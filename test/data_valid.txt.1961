to the editor it is incredibly shortsighted of president bush to restrict research opportunities using embryonic stem cells just because there is a chance the stem cells will have come from an aborted fetus findings deepen debate on using embryonic cells april 3 this will put the united states at an extreme disadvantage scientifically since it is now unknown which of the stem cells will lead to the most efficient technology and potential cures for diseases mr bush 's decision may greatly slow scientific advancements by requiring that only adult stem cells be used for research even if they are not the most effective in creating a cure the bush administration needs to realize that women are going to have abortions abortions have been and will be performed whether or not the embryonic stem cells are being used for research purposes president bush should use a precious resource that will otherwise just be disposed of without being of benefit to anyone cheryl l torrontor pittsburgh
