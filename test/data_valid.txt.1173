the food and drug administration yesterday approved the first drug for women with a form of irritable bowel syndrome an often painful disorder that afflicts millions of americans the drug zelnorm made by the swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis international was approved for short term use by women with irritable bowel syndrome characterized by constipation a group that an fda official said could number 37 million the drug 's effectiveness in men who are less likely to develop irritable bowel syndrome has not been established by clinical trials while patients can take laxatives or painkillers approved for other uses zelnorm is the first drug specifically approved for this form of the syndrome and the first that the drug agency says can reduce not only constipation but pain and bloating as well another drug lotronex was reapproved last month for another form of the syndrome that one with diarrhea after having been withdrawn over safety concerns yesterday 's action met with mixed reviews i think this is a drug that fills an unmet need for a lot of folks with an important problem said a consultant to novartis dr walter l peterson a professor at the university of texas southwestern medical center in dallas but a frequent critic of the drug agency dr sidney m wolfe director of the public citizen health research group in washington said zelnorm appeared to increase the risk of developing ovarian cysts dr wolfe also said the drug was only marginally effective and added that patients could instead take metamucil a popular over the counter laxative given how barely effective the drug is and the fact that there are alternatives available he said it would seem to be a very bad decision on the part of the fda dr joyce korvick deputy director of the fda division overseeing gastrointestinal drugs said the concern about ovarian cysts was unwarranted dr peterson the novartis consultant also said that there was no increased risk of cysts and added that metamucil had not been shown effective for all irritable bowel symptoms there does seem to be great demand for treatments for irritable bowel syndrome as shown by the uproar over lotronex made by glaxosmithkline that drug was taken off the market late in 2000 less than 10 months after its approval because it had been linked to serious side effects and a few deaths but thousands of patients pleaded with the fda to allow lotronex back on the market saying they could not lead a normal life without it last month the agency did reapprove it though with new restrictions on its use the agency said last year that zelnorm would not be approved because it seemed linked to an increase in abdominal surgery particularly gallbladder removal but novartis provided more data showing that some of the patients had planned their operations before starting on the drug said dr korvick of the fda in three clinical trials the patients who reported after three months that the drug had relieved their symptoms ranged from 39 percent to 44 percent that was 5 to 11 percentage points greater than those who reported relief from a placebo the biggest side effect of the drug was diarrhea which generally went away zelnorm will be sold only by prescription this is n't like you go down to your corner store and buy a laxative dr korvick said further the agency 's approval is limited the fda is recommending it only for women who it says should take it for only four to six weeks to start because there are no data from clinical trials on the effects of use beyond 12 weeks once a drug is approved however doctors are free to prescribe it for other uses or other patients daniel vasella chairman and chief executive of novartis said the company was also doing studies to see whether zelnorm could be used to treat general chronic constipation and heartburn but he said worldwide sales of the drug could reach 500 million to 1 billion a year for irritable bowel syndrome alone zelnorm has now been approved by more than 30 countries including canada and australia though not by the european union which is requiring another clinical trial nancy norton founder and president of the international foundation for functional gastrointestinal disorders a patient group in milwaukee applauded the fda 's action this really has been a population that has been underserved for decades she said zelnorm known generically as tegaserod maleate is to be taken twice a day as a pill novartis said the drug should be available in the fall and was likely to cost 3 to 4 a day
