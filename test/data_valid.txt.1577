dean tavoularis on the set of the film 'one from the heart hollywood calif 1982 i was the production designer for francis ford coppola 's movie 'one from the heart it was a love story set in las vegas which was created on sound stages not shot in the city there was no attempt to make it realistic it had to be stylized that scene with the girl on the wire is truly a fantasy the leading man meets a dancer that 's nastassia kinski who performs for him in a junkyard we made neon signs that looked like they came from casinos we had a miniature las vegas in the distance and put a canvas backing painted blue 35 feet high in front of the stage wall from behind we put hundreds of little lights through the canvas to make the sky the movie was kind of a blend of a movie and theater with music by tom waits i went to the first of two big screenings at radio city music hall in 1982 after there was applause but people did n't flock to see it for francis it was a big big deal because he financed it now he had to pay all these bills for my part too i did n't work for almost two years the movie was considered a fiasco and i was perceived as being irresponsible because it went over budget so i was totally blackballed by hollywood i took it as a badge of honor i saw the film a month ago for the first time in 15 years i felt it was a poor cousin of 'moulin rouge but i liked it in the first few minutes you realize it 's a theatrical fantasy that 's how you should look at the film interview by catherine saint louis
