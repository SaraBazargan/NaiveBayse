after throwing barbs at all the other presidential candidates scott dailey a member of the school board here introduced patrick j buchanan to a luncheon today by joshing pat says he is a serious candidate the polls say he is dead serious it is an assessment that mr buchanan the reform party candidate does not strenuously dispute hardly anyone believes his candidacy will play a decisive role this year he did not have much support in the first place as mr dailey implied and the support he does have mr buchanan feels is as likely to be drawn from vice president al gore as from gov george w bush a new york times cbs news poll taken statewide last week showed mr buchanan with 1 percent of the vote in florida he is apparently not doing much better anywhere else at a news conference here today mr buchanan said one problem was lack of support from conservative republicans the great driving factor of conservatives he said is to get rid of al gore many of his supporters he said would probably not bother to vote if he were not in the race with no chance to win or even affect the outcome why run we want to build a new third party a conservative party he said one goal almost certainly out of reach is to get 5 percent of the vote to qualify the reform party for federal funds in the next presidential election
