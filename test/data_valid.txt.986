a newer world kit carson john c fremont and the claiming of the american west by david roberts illustrated 320 pp new york simon schuster 25 in the two decades before the civil war few characters associated with the american west were as celebrated as christopher kit carson and john c fremont carson born in kentucky in 1809 and raised in missouri made the wild rocky mountains his backyard during years as a fur trapper mountain man and guide his indian fighting exploits became so legendary that they inspired a shelf of highly imaginative dime novels penned by tenderfoot easterners fremont born in georgia in 1813 had begun as a mapmaker in the army topographical corps and quickly advanced to lead his own surveys of the far west carson was his faithful and intrepid guide fremont 's published reports of these expeditions became best sellers inspiring thousands for better or worse to make the perilous overland journey to oregon and california known thereafter as the pathfinder even though he followed others and broke no significant new ground fremont kept up his high profile thanks in part to his marriage to the daughter of senator thomas hart benton one of the most powerful men in washington jessie fremont would ghostwrite all of her husband 's best selling travelogues fremont had a major role in what was called the conquest of california from the mexican government in 1846 he survived a disastrous winter crossing of the rockies was the first presidential candidate of the newly founded republican party in 1856 he lost to the democrat james buchanan and was with the outbreak of the civil war at the top of abraham lincoln 's appointments list for major generals but after that when the brighter more discerning light of wartime and politics cast his troubling flaws into high relief when he proved to be one of the union 's worst generals and when he openly defied his presidential sponsor 's orders against what lincoln deemed premature emancipation of missouri slaves his tumultuous public life began to be over in a newer world david roberts draws on previous works about carson and fremont but also sets out to incorporate recent historical scholarship about american indians to provide a needed alternate point of view as the author of books about mountaineering and adventure travel roberts also managed to retrace by car or on foot all of fremont 's and carson 's exploits in the mountains of new mexico colorado california and wyoming he has written a remarkably well balanced portrait of two major but still controversial figures of the old west fremont was a relentless self promoter he could not follow orders keep promises or admit mistakes he was a philanderer he exhibited bouts of cold callousness and tolerated genocidal acts against indians while carefully drawing this unflattering portrait however roberts is willing to give fremont and carson for that matter who as a young man was as bloodthirsty an indian fighter as any mountain man the benefit of the doubt his accounts of carson 's and fremont 's adventurous lives make fascinating reading even with the human wreckage left in their wake and the tension never lets up roberts focuses on four campaigns that epitomize the two explorers triumphs and failures believing that each campaign contains the kernel of a stirring seldom told adventure tale fremont 's mission in 1842 to map the eastern half of the oregon trail had its climax at the summit of what he thought was the highest peak in the rockies which he and a few others reached after much suffering though there are actually many higher peaks fremont peak was the hardest climb any americans had done in the west to that time in roberts 's telling we see the feat through both the eyes of the explorers and roberts 's own and the effect is striking fremont 's campaign into the utah mountains the great salt lake basin and northwest to oregon is similarly well described he horrified his supervisors in the peaceable topographical corps by embarking armed to the teeth including a horse drawn howitzer and impetuously straying into mexican california subjecting his men and teams to awful sufferings in the wintry sierra there is even more detail about fremont 's next campaign which famously roamed far from its assignment in colorado into the middle of california just as the mexican war was breaking out this episode when fremont abruptly removed his explorer 's disguise to declare himself grandiosely military commandant of the territory of california earned him the enmity of the regular army commander brig gen stephen watts kearny whom fremont ignored until he was arrested and sent back to washington for court martial and dismissal even then roberts writes he could not begin to recognize the defects in his own character that had brought about his downfall it was all the fault of others fremont 's role in california has been much written about but roberts lingers on a lesser known facet of the campaign in the northern sacramento valley when fremont gave carson and the government soldiers carte blanche to perpetrate an unprovoked massacre of indians in every respect the equal of wounded knee or aravaipa roberts 's retelling from the perspective of the campaigners as well as from the modern day view of the actual unmarked terrain is horrifying the number killed i can not say carson recalled it was a perfect butchery the episode marked the beginning of a turnaround for the old scout as can be seen in roberts 's chapter on carson 's later part in the army 's brutal civil war campaigns against the navajo and apache tribes of new mexico by then carson had become a conciliator roberts 's most harrowing account is of fremont 's most disastrous expedition into the rockies in the winter of 1848 49 a sumptuously wrongheaded notion to follow his father in law benton 's armchair order to find a transcontinental railroad route from his home in st louis along the mountainous 38th parallel to california fremont 's stubborn ego resulted in the deaths by cold or starvation of 10 men nearly a third of his party the certain cannibalism of victims and the impossible to ignore charges that fremont left stragglers behind to die one of the hallmarks of this unusual book is that roberts frequently quotes from the historians who have gone before crediting them for their scholarship and literary work gently correcting any mistakes and putting anachronisms into modern context not only does he resurrect the large lives of john c fremont and kit carson but also the paler more cerebral ones who chronicled them it is a grand collaboration richly told david haward bain 's most recent book is empire express building the first transcontinental railroad
