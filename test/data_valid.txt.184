allan houston 's recent scoring surge filled with pump fakes that send opponents flying and pull up 3 pointers in transition has been a sight to behold not only for fans but also for his teammates like everyone else the knicks have gotten used to watching houston carry them but there is a downside to that and it can be seen in the offensive output of latrell sprewell and kurt thomas who have struggled while houston has flourished the knicks are three games out of the eastern conference 's eighth and final playoff spot and for them to reach the postseason sprewell and thomas will need to become threats again while houston has averaged 357 points on 56 percent shooting over the last four games sprewell has averaged 115 points while making only 274 percent of his shots this is not just a recent trend as houston has improved in the 20 games since the break for the all star game averaging 268 points sprewell has averaged only 154 points on 354 percent shooting i 'm concerned coach don chaney said of sprewell 's slump i do n't want him to get to the point where he panics because i want him to play his game hopefully he breaks out of it because we definitely need both of those guys scoring i think one of the problems is that a lot of times especially the way allan 's been playing lately we 've been force feeding him so sprewell 's had a couple of periods where he 's been trying to get it to allan a lot and he 's having droughts in terms of the frequency of his shots but allan 's been playing so big lately that you 've got to milk that maybe i need to do a better job of running more plays for spree sprewell was not as easy on himself after missing 9 of 13 shots and scoring 8 points wednesday in the knicks 101 96 loss to new orleans he said he simply had to play better for myself and kurt we just have to do a better job of putting the ball in the hole sprewell said we 're the other two guys on the team that have to put the ball in the hole and we have n't been doing that so we have to give allan some help in that area other things i feel like i 'm doing fine but shooting wise i just do n't feel comfortable right now thomas 's production has dipped as well he has averaged 119 points and 68 rebounds the last 11 games when he does not score it is usually because foul trouble limits his minutes and that has been the case in the last two games thomas picked up his second foul less than five minutes into each game and while the knicks beat san antonio on tuesday they lost at new orleans with thomas playing only 27 minutes the knicks were crushed on the backboards against new orleans giving up 18 offensive rebounds and being outrebounded by 45 33 over all we 're really up a creek when kurt gets in early foul trouble or is not in the game chaney said we rely on him for so many different things but i do n't want kurt to play soft houston said his main concern was that the knicks did not become a one man show when i get a lot of touches i still want to get everybody involved so they can have a rhythm he said i feel like when you 're going good you have to go with it but everybody still has to be involved i do n't think it 's a case where they 're not but i want to make sure we 're all in a rhythm because late in games i may be double teamed or something rebounds the knicks said extra security measures would be in place for their game friday night against detroit at madison square garden and advised fans to arrive early doors will open 90 minutes before the scheduled 8 pm start mutombo nears return to nets the nets said yesterday that dikembe mutombo could return to practice as early as today after spending nearly 14 weeks recovering from surgery to repair the torn ligament in his right wrist we anticipate that he will begin practice either friday or monday rod thorn the nets president said mutombo said wednesday that he was aiming for march 29 against the golden state warriors for his first game back i want to get some practices and games in before the playoffs he said
