for starters there is the floating apostrophe it 's a bit of a pain the holiday about to be upon us is known as presidents day but if the past is a guide you will soon stumble upon news articles and advertisements that render it as president 's day or presidents day or even president day the s disappearing into the ether along with the punctuation the apostrophe has migrated over the years said jason bezis a law student at the university of california in berkeley but that is a relatively minor irritant far more offensive to mr bezis is the very concept of presidents day however you choose to punctuate it he has become something of a crusader to rid the land of this event and to restore the washington 's birthday and lincoln 's birthday holidays to the separate glory each once enjoyed you may not have even been aware that this was a problem focused as you probably were on more immediate presidential issues like bill clinton 's move to harlem it just goes to show the importance of taking the long view for 30 years the days commemorating our two greatest presidents have been kind of squished together into one more monday holiday designed to give americans a chance to do what many of them do best sleep late and prowl the malls lincoln 's birthday came and went two days ago virtually ignored as ever washington 's birthday feb 22 will not fare much better instead we have what is popularly known as presidents day the third monday in february which happens to be next monday the 19th some insist on calling the period we are now in presidents week but there is no such creature mr bezis points out congress never approved anything called presidents day let alone presidents week it merely decreed that washington 's birthday be observed on the third monday in february over the years a few states and more than a few auto dealerships tossed lincoln in for good measure in time the whole stew came to be called presidents day it drifted almost on autopilot to presidents day mr bezis complained presidents day is trying to assert squatters rights to george washington 's federal holiday enough is enough he says restore lincoln and washington to clear separate honors that are due the great emancipator and the parent figure of his country a term used here to forestall letters from those who regard father of his country as politically incorrect a bill to reaffirm these birthday distinctions was introduced last week by two republican congressmen roscoe g bartlett of maryland and tom tancredo of colorado part of the problem as they see it is that many americans have come to regard presidents day as a moment to salute all presidents washington and lincoln are lumped together with white house lights like franklin pierce and william henry harrison whose main accomplishment was to die a month after catching pneumonia during his inauguration the congressman 's feeling is that when you honor everyone you honor no one said lisa wright a spokeswoman for mr bartlett makes sense but why not take a more expansive view why not celebrate the birthdays of every man who has been president there are only 42 we can handle the load true some of those men were mediocrities but they would qualify for honors under the hruska rule in 1970 senator roman l hruska of nebraska strongly defended a nominee to the supreme court whose credentials were slender the country has a lot of mediocre people mr hruska said adding they are entitled to a little representation are n't they and a little chance new york city could pave the way by recognizing the birthdays of chief executives closely identified with it washington who was sworn in at federal hall on wall street is already taken care of how about also acknowledging oct 27 the birthday of theodore roosevelt the only president born in this city and april 27 the birthday of ulysses s grant the only president buried here or maybe tip our collective hat grim though the gesture may seem on the birthdays of the four who died in the city april 28 james monroe oct 5 chester a arthur aug 10 herbert hoover and jan 9 richard m nixon there could be grand pageants and period costumes schoolchildren would learn american history and should this come to pass we can recommend an actor who does the best james monroe imitation you ever heard sounds exactly like the man
