there was a time when every teacher in america seemed to have read four books the blackboard jungle up the down staircase goodbye mr chips and to sir with love or at least they had seen the movies since then other authors have had a profound effect on teachers jonathan kozol and herbert kohl come to mind but unlike their predecessors they are crusaders writing for an audience that wants to change the world the difference tells us something significant the first four books mr chips came out in the 1930 's the others in the 50 's and 60 's had modest goals their authors were less bent on exposing the evils of the system than on telling a good yarn and in the case of bel kaufman the author of up the down staircase earning some laughs along with tears of indignation all four were works of fiction reality heightened in casting teachers as heroes they inspired idealistic well educated people to join the profession with the conviction that they could make a difference in describing the frustrations of the new york city school system through absurd but concocted directives from the anonymous bureaucracy ms kaufman reassured countless teachers who were burned out that they were not alone in awarding them victim status she also of course got them off the hook the influence of the books has extended beyond teachers to become part of the cultural lexicon their titles iconic references conjuring tough city schools conquered by plucky and caring teachers but as i went back and reread these books recently i realized that even though they are still good stories they are surprisingly dated because our attitude toward public schools has shifted over the last generation schools have changed and our views of them have changed also so completely that we hardly realize it anymore when blackboard jungle and up the down staircase were published there was an assumption that public schools were part of the common fabric of society part of the shock readers of the blackboard jungle felt over the attempted rape of a teacher by a student or the harassment of the hero 's pregnant wife by another student stemmed from the notion that this was where we were sending our children now public schools in the big cities that give public schools their reputation new york chicago los angeles houston boston and washington are places where we send other people 's children most of these children are poor black hispanic and in growing numbers asian americans as new yorkers know neither the city 's mayor nor its schools chancellor sends his school aged children to public school only two members of the seven member board of education have children in public schools the old sense of a common culture and shared values beneath the schoolhouse roof no longer exists as the conviction that schools represent a common culture and shared values has faded the psychology of teaching has shifted too in the blackboard jungle the hero rick dadier is a navy veteran with a pregnant wife to support he is so eager for a job that he has to suppress his guilty glee as he beats out his mild mannered high school classmate for the position as an english teacher at north manual trades he wins the job by walking proudly and reciting the battle cry from henry v or hank the cinq as he breezily calls it to the chairman of the english department all he wants is to support his family however modestly and teach english to his all male vocational students not change the world in the end he is thrilled to win over a single student and he can smile at the cynical banter in the teachers lounge today school districts hire advertising agencies to recruit teachers their slick campaigns do not pitch opportunities to share the joys of shakespeare or toni morrison either they are not about education they are about religion in speeches to new teachers new york city 's schools chancellor harold o levy has sanctified teaching as a calling yet an official at teach for america recently urged me not to describe the organization 's young recruits who sign up to teach in urban schools for two years as missionaries i understand the qualms of the official at teach for america missionaries did not traditionally identify with the people they set out to save but then the debate over what to do about schools is not about us anymore it is about us and them richard rothstein is on vacation
