ozzie smith spent several hours yesterday moving from a house in the st louis area to another one 20 miles away and several minutes biting his cuticles thinking about his chances of being elected into the baseball hall of fame today he was a little jittery as he unpacked dozens of boxes smith the acrobatic shortstop who won 13 gold glove awards for the st louis cardinals from 1980 to 1992 should be able to give his fingers a rest this afternoon he is expected to join baseball 's elite players in his first year of eligibility he is surely the most dazzling shortstop ever to play the game and may be the best defensive shortstop too still smith admitted to some nervousness anytime you 're waiting for something this big to happen you get butterflies smith said in a telephone interview more than anything making it on the first ballot that 's important i do n't want to play that down to make it on the first ballot says something about you while smith was almost certain to be the leader on the ballots cast by the baseball writers association of america gary carter was hoping to receive the requisite 75 percent of the vote in his fifth year of eligibility carter was considered the best catcher in the national league while playing for the montreal expos for 11 years and the mets for five during a 19 year career last year he finished behind dave winfield and kirby puckett who were elected to the hall carter received 649 percent of the vote falling 53 votes short of election the other top candidates considered long shots are jim rice who received 579 percent of the vote last year bruce sutter who got 476 and andre dawson who is in his first year on the ballot after hitting 438 homers this is carter 's best chance for election the competition will increase next year when eddie murray and ryne sandberg who will probably be first ballot choices are eligible hopefully we 'll get some great news carter said by telephone i know nothing more than the great anticipation i 'm feeling i 'm just excited i ca n't wait for all of this to be over and the news comes from cooperstown once carlton fisk was elected in 2000 carter figured that his election would follow the catchers were contemporaries with fisk spending all of his 24 year career in the american league and their statistics were similar in his 19 year career carter batted 262 with 324 homers and 1225 runs batted in in 2296 games fisk batted 269 with 376 homers and 1330 rbi in 2499 games carter also won two most valuable player awards a vote for smith is a resounding and rare vote for defense smith lamented that most of the attention goes to the players who can hit the ball over the fence smith hardly ever did that managing 28 homers and batting 262 in a 19 year career but smith named to 15 all star teams was a fielding genius i 'm content with what i did on the field smith said after you do that it 's all out of your hands i 'm hopeful that will culminate with me having played well enough to be worthy of being in the hall of fame smith would be the ninth shortstop voted into the hall by the baseball writers and the third in more than two decades joining robin yount 1999 and luis aparicio 1984 when smith was asked about the prospect of being in such a select group of shortstops he compared it to being in the 3000 hit club as a player i never played the game to make the hall of fame smith said i played the game because i enjoyed it but i wanted to play well enough to be considered for the hall of fame the rest is icing on the cake
