a prominent congressional commission appointed to study the giant american trade deficit determined that the imbalance has become unsustainably large and dangerous for the economy but mostly disagreed on what to do about it the assessment by the 12 member commission split equally among experts appointed by democrats and republicans reflects growing concern that the gap between what america sells abroad and what it imports from other nations has grown too large from about 30 billion in 1991 to an estimated 450 billion this year posing a risk to the record setting economic expansion and the strength of the dollar but the 350 page report compiled after a year and a half of research and testimony also shows the deep partisan divide over trade policy that is likely to prevail into the next administration commission members clashed for example on whether future trade agreements should set standards on social issues like labor and the environment as a way of eliminating some disparities in the global marketplace republicans leaned strongly toward allowing the market to solve most trade issues while democrats tended to favor government led solutions the report serves mostly to illustrate the contours of the party line split chapters on the causes and consequences of the deficit and recommendations for future trade policy elucidate how the republican and democratic appointees could not agree on much even a news conference to announce the report today became a forum for grandstanding murray weidenbaum a reagan administration adviser who was chairman of the commission accused democrats of trying to muddy the waters of trade by insisting that new agreements set baseline standards for labor and the environment he argued that developing nations so dislike the idea of labor and environmental standards that mandating them threatens the whole enterprise of expanding trade george becker a commission member and president of the united steel workers of america responded by saying that some six million jobs have been lost because of america 's one sided trade openness to the world and that the deficit reflects the lack of worker rights to share in the wealth they helped create but the report was notable for a few broad areas of concurrence the commission endorsed the view that increased international trade generally benefits the united states and that trying to halt globalization is futile it also pushed for a new global round of trade talks like the ones that collapsed in seattle late last year though the commission members split over what the aim of those talks should be both republican and democratic members said that the commerce department and the united states trade representative should hire more staff devoted exclusively to making sure that foreign nations grant all the trading rights to united states companies that they promised a step they said could help narrow the deficit the panel sharply criticized previous failures to enforce the terms of trade agreements the united states has reached in the past faulting the clinton administration in particular for its drive to expand trade access without ensuring full compliance c richard d'amato a democratic trade expert said the clinton administration had signed 300 trade agreements but had declined to enforce them meaning that the united states throws 1 billion a day out the window as foreign countries take advantage of the united states the commission also took a unanimous stand in favor of relaxing export controls on high technology goods and limiting the use of unilateral economic sanctions to punish nations that disagree with the united states the cold war is over the report says the panel also concurred that the data on trade collected by the commerce department is so limited in scope that it is difficult to pinpoint the real causes and solutions to the deficit calling on congress to provide more financing for the effort
