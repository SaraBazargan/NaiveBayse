the pharmaceutical industry has a lot of problems in washington these days its prices and profits proving an irresistible target for politicians with hard pressed elderly constituents and an election on the horizon but there are few more persistent irritants than representative bernard sanders the democratic socialist from vermont who is one of two independents in the house mr sanders a gruff spoken 58 year old native of flatbush with a thatch of white hair and a rumpled 60 's academic style has twice taken elderly constituents on well publicized trips to canada to buy prescription drugs highlighting the lower prices across the border he has pushed legislation that he said would allow american pharmacists and distributors to reimport prescription drugs approved by the food and drug administration from canada and mexico and sell them at lower costs when a lobbying alliance backed by the pharmaceutical industry set up a web site to highlight the problems in the canadian health care system wwwbusfromcanadaorg mr sanders quickly countered with a web site about the inequities of american drug pricing and the legislative proposals to deal with them berniehousegov bustocanada in an interview on thursday night mr sanders had the quiet glow of a man who believed that political lightning was finally striking his cause you 're dealing here not just with an economic issue or even a health care issue you 're dealing with a very profound moral issue he said time is long overdue for the congress to stand up to these people and protect the american people jackie cottrell a spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america responded what 's moral is to make sure medicines are available through insurance coverage but also to make sure that congressman sanders and his allies do n't stifle our ability to invent medicines that help and heal mr sanders has focused on this issue since the 1980 's when he was the mayor of burlington vt and created a task force on health care medicare the health program for the elderly generally does not cover outpatient prescription drugs and a third of its elderly beneficiaries have no drug coverage at all you ca n't walk down a main street in vermont without someone coming up and saying 'bernie you 've got to do something about the high cost of prescription drugs he said t hese days of course nearly everyone says he wants to do something to help the elderly with drug costs but mr sanders stands out he believes not only in new prescription drug coverage for the elderly and not only in finding a way to end what he considers price discrimination against american consumers but in a publicly financed national health insurance program a canadian style system administered by the states for everyone he does not seem to worry much about the drug industry 's arguments that its prices in the united states are necessary to cover the cost of research he said he met with some industry lobbyists last year and remembers that they were wearing fancy shoes he spoke not with irony but to use his word with contempt in an age of careful centrism there is an archaic quality to mr sanders political speech not to mention a razor 's edge i know what it 's like to live in a family without any money he said the economic suffering that is totally unnecessary among the uninsured the working poor and many of the elderly his father who emigrated from poland at the age of 17 was a paint salesman he worked very hard he never made a lot of money mr sanders said in a quick staccato his eyes focused on the floor lack of money was a constant stress on my parents relationship and in our household mr sanders only sibling a brother became a social worker mr sanders himself after a year at brooklyn college went to the university of chicago on a combination of loans grants and part time jobs he was a lackluster student he wrote in his autobiography but learned a lot more from my out of class activities in groups like the congress of racial equality and the young people 's socialist league he moved to vermont in the late 1960 's working at a mixture of state government carpentry and writing jobs and ultimately ended up in politics initially he had little success but he was elected mayor of burlington from 1981 to 1989 and in 1990 won vermont 's only house seat the first independent elected to congress in 40 years mr sanders has four children and his wife jane o'meara sanders has been a key adviser in his political career while he tends to align with the democrats he said he never considered becoming one why both major political parties are heavily influenced by big money he said he noted that in nine years in congress he has spent one weekend in washington he talked scornfully of the journalists and the politicians who spend their time talking to one another with no sense of what 's going on in the real world mr sanders clearly feels he has the drug industry on the defensive what i try to do here is not to be an ideologue but to talk issues he said and when you talk issues people respond positively still he acknowledges i sometimes scratch my head that somebody like me ever made it to the us congress
