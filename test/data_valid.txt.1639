in the traditional telling of pinocchio a wooden puppet longs to become human in boris eifman 's ballet version a man also longs to turn all humans into wooden puppets perhaps it 's no coincidence that mr eifman is a russian whose career as a choreographer started before the days of glasnost and perestroika but he maintains that pinocchio which his company the eifman ballet of st petersburg will perform this weekend at city center is much more a joyous spectacle than a piece of political theater i bring a little bit my fantasy my vision about this story he said maybe it is more philosophical mr eifman 's villain the magician karabas wants to make the world his puppet theater but pinocchio who sometimes falls under karabas 's control fights him with the help of the good fairy pinocchio restores freedom and by risking his own life to save his human creator gepetto pinocchio passes a moral test that allows him to become real the score is based on pieces by offenbach which timur kogan has reinterpreted and rearranged lasting about two hours with one intermission the work includes acrobatics and even magic acts it 's ballet it 's circus it 's pantomime with marionettes mr eifman said but here the marionettes are dancers it is family ballet not so much children 's ballet he said i want the kids and the parents to each see something special pinocchio tonight at 8

screaming braying crying howling and maniacal laughter is emanating from west 42nd street on weekends so what else is new what 's unusual is that all these sounds are part of children 's entertainment ogres trolls and dragon wings which may be the most ambitious project yet from vital children 's theater company uses a source even more reliable than dolby stereo for many of its booming sound effects the young audience the premise is that dr herman von villainy milo barasorda the quintessential mad scientist has been asked to provide creepy creatures for a piece called ogres trolls and dragon 's wings with the help of his nerdy assistant durf michael connolly he builds a monster making machine that eager children help operate after a few glitches it works and an oily director matt vlahakis begins to stage scenes but to the doctor 's dismay his creatures are duped into very undignified things like dancing being slain by knights and worst of all falling in love the show which includes vaudeville songs by sally husch dean and some seussesque verse the book and lyrics are by pat lydersen seems in tune with the era of shrek but it is more than 20 years old the director nicole lerario is to be applauded for reviving it young children will love it especially when they 're asked to cheer up dr von villainy by playing roles that probably are n't always a stretch growly little
