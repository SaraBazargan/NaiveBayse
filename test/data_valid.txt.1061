things are looking bleaker than ever for pluto the most disrespected of the nine planets that we learned about in elementary school back then we thought we knew what a planet was namely a spherical object that revolved around the sun and reflected its light that fourth grade version of pluto even had an exotic cachet about it it was so small and remote that it was not identified until 1930 after decades of fruitless searching for a mysterious and much larger planet x that was believed to lie beyond the planet neptune although pluto 's fans hate to admit it the ninth planet owes its status more to the fact that astronomers expected to find a planet out beyond neptune than to any intrinsic merit pluto has a moon and an atmosphere but its icy rocky body is more like a comet 's core than like any of the other planets pluto 's orbit is elliptical not circular and is not in the same plane as the other planetary orbits last year the hayden planetarium caused quite a stir by dropping pluto from its list of planets now in the latest blow astronomers reported last week that they have found another dirty ice ball about half the size of pluto that actually behaves more like a planet than pluto does with a circular orbit the newly discovered quaoar pronounced kwah o ar lies among a multitude of small bodies in a region known as the kuiper belt that reflects the solar system as it was before tiny pieces of matter coalesced into bigger planets astronomers predict that they will find up to 10 similar objects in the kuiper belt that are as large as or larger than pluto so unless we want to add 10 more planets to the elementary school curriculum we would be wise to downgrade pluto to the distant iceball it is correction october 16 2002 wednesday an editorial yesterday erred in saying that pluto differed from the other planets in that its orbit is elliptical rather than circular all the planets have elliptical orbits pluto 's is the least circular
