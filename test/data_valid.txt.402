more than nine decades since its inception the new york times neediest cases fund is in the midst of another year of extraordinary need one that has inspired more than 44 million in giving since early november but seven weeks into the fund 's annual campaign the flow of donations to the seven local charities supported by the fund has been lagging despite the stirrings of an economic recovery in new york city and elsewhere in 2003 the need for the aid and comfort provided by the neediest cases fund has not diminished despite a post 9 11 recovery poverty figures remain staggering a recent report released by one of the seven charities the community service society noted that one of every five new york city residents or 17 million people could be considered poor having an annual income of less than 18400 for a family of four compared with one of every eight people nationwide for those living under such constraints even the smallest setback can have a devastating effect one month 's rent unpaid can turn into falling two or three months behind then eviction unpaid utility bills can leave people in the dark and the cold without lights or a phone throughout its history the neediest cases fund has responded to these kinds of personal crises by telling the stories of struggling new yorkers people grappling with homelessness and hunger catastrophic illness and family turmoil the fund has inspired acts of generosity and compassion donors from new york and nationwide are the lifeline connecting people in need to the array of services provided by the fund 's charities but as of thursday donations were about 9 percent behind where they were at the same point in last year 's campaign the number of donors was off too by 19 percent at this pace the fund will be greatly behind last year 's total when the campaign concludes at the end of january we find this startling in a season of unusual need said jack rosenthal president of the new york times company foundation which administers the fund he said he hoped that giving would pick up amid the spirit of the holiday season the lag in donations underscores the generosity of those who have given thus far among the notable contributions one represented an unexpected first the neediest cases fund received a 5000 donation from the children 's aid society itself another of the seven charities that benefit from the fund 's campaign we are aware the staff and the board of how important the campaign is and how it has helped the children 's aid society said philip coltoff the society 's chief executive through the agency 's payroll deduction plan employees earmarked contributions he said staff members had the option of giving to children 's aid directly he said we wanted to support the work of the other charitable institutions it is a very good feeling to be a giver and recipient at the same time for recipients of neediest cases money like lavador campbell the support offers hope in hard times ms campbell 39 was profiled earlier in this year 's campaign she adopted her 9 year old niece nadia garrett after nadia 's parents were jailed for separate offenses that added to the financial stress of ms campbell who already had a five member household but children 's aid helped her asking the neediest cases fund to assist with rent and other needs like winter clothing it was like hitting the lottery ms campbell said i do n't know what i would have done there have been other acts of kindness and many other donations for the third consecutive year the starr foundation a private nonprofit group associated with the insurer american international group gave 1 million the largest amount given by one organization this is an immense act a generosity that is greatly appreciated mr rosenthal said individuals have given too a contribution of 10 was sent by one 9 year old girl larger sums from families and individuals across the country have also been received one ohio family the highs sent 500 shirley high said she knew she wanted to support the neediest cases fund after reading about a homeless family 's struggle it is hard to find an organization that you can really trust she said by reading the stories you know the money is going where it should go ms high said she was happy to know that all donations go directly to help the poor and that the fund pays all administrative costs i
