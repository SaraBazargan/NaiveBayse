the bush administration is engineering bread and butter changes in the federal regulation of overtime pay commendably making hundreds of thousands more low wage earners eligible for time and a half at the same time however proposed labor department regulations have stirred justifiable concern that numerous white collar middle income workers could lose income because employers will have more leeway to pronounce them managers and deny their current right to overtime the proposed regulations are being presented by the labor department as overdue improvements in the way workers roles are defined and compensated under the 1938 law requiring overtime pay beyond a 40 hour week controversy is brewing over this mixed bag of changes they have thus far received far too little public scrutiny yet are heading for final approval by next year the most welcome change would raise the ceiling for what low wage managers and supervisors can earn before losing eligibility for overtime since 1975 that cap has been 8060 a year it would be raised to 22100 this is laudable providing overtime rights for an additional 13 million workers many of them minority workers in low income areas more problematical is the possibility that more workers millions according to pro labor analysts could be forced into unpaid overtime under the regulations which do not affect blue collar or union contract workers managerial definitions would be relaxed to deny overtime to more white collar professionals earning over 65000 a year by some estimates veteran police detectives or senior nurses might lose overtime compensation that now accounts for as much as 25 percent of their salaries the administration should rethink this but it maintains that the change is justified by modern job conditions and would deprive only 640000 white collar workers of overtime there are compelling arguments that far more of the most experienced middle income workers could be handed hollow fancier job titles and suffer paycheck hits more amorphous terms would replace current detailed criteria for who is a boss the present jobless recovery is prodding greater productivity from workers fighting to keep their jobs in this scrambling market the new regulations could be used to force unpaid overtime from skilled workers in such varied fields as advertising marketing health research and computers at the very least the proposed changes are complex and worthy of more detailed study but the pity is that the labor department 's 90 day comment period on the regulations has just expired and the republican controlled congress has so far shown no interest in exercising oversight for such basic changes in a law designed to protect the rights of american workers
