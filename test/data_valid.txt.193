re the indian students arrested on trespassing charges at a herricks school playground case that wo n't die deepens racial divide may 25 assistant district attorney patrick mccormack tries to explain why he is renewing charges of criminal trespass and disorderly conduct after the court dismissed them he says that he will now try to identify not just what happened but who did what is n't that what he was supposed to do in the first place and what criminal act will he attribute to the arrested students who were standing outside the fence as to superintendent john bierwirth 's remark that this should never have snowballed as it did if handled differently it could have been resolved quickly exactly if he had not directed the police to arrest the children as they were leaving the field or even if he had dropped the charges promptly that would have ended it in fact with one exception three months after the arrest he refused our offers to negotiate the private investigators could not interview the arrested students because they were facing criminal charges the investigators report based on only the district 's side of the story claims that we were irresponsible for saying the superintendent overreacted by calling the police we never said that the overreaction was not in calling the police but in directing them to arrest the students and in persisting in resolving the issue in court rather than in school the report concludes that the police were called to prevent a gang fight or some other serious assault dispersal would have done that just as effectively as arrest especially since the police saw no fighting no weapons no injuries no drugs or alcohol the superintendent unlike pharaoh should have let his students go barbara bernstein president nassau chapter new york civil liberties union mineola
