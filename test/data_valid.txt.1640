mary tyler moore is pushing the envelope again yes she surprised fans 21 years ago when she lost the perky turn the world on smile and transformed herself into the cold as ice suburban wife and mother in the film ordinary people but that woman 's sins were emotional now ms moore is playing a cold blooded killer an apparently heartless con artist who strolling out of a restaurant steals a fur coat as casually as some people might grab a matchbook the judge in like mother like son the strange story of sante and kenny kimes sunday night on cbs calls her the most degenerate defendant ever to appear in this courtroom a sociopath of unremitting malevolence and ms moore makes her believable the movie itself is a run of the mill true crime drama but some fine performances and the enormity of the actual events keep it on course the case is well known to new yorkers in july 1998 irene silverman a wealthy 82 year old widow who lived in a 77 million town house on east 65th street in manhattan disappeared two of mrs silverman 's boarders were convicted of murdering her and sentenced last year to life in prison sante kimes 63 and her younger son kenny 23 the first thing sante or at least her film incarnation played by ms moore would want you to know is that her name is pronounced shon tay it 's a name she made up having grown up as sandy chambers as the film shows she pursued ken kimes robert forster a successful hotel developer and had no reason to go on stealing after their marriage but she did it for the thrill enlisting the help of her sons her older son kent walker resisted grew up to lead a law abiding life and published a memoir son of a grifter earlier this year while her children were growing up ms kimes went to prison for four years for enslaving her maids literally when kenny grew up he became her accomplice and her constant companion in the film mother and son gabriel olds who is convincingly cold are seen holding hands in the courtroom sleeping in the same bed and leaning in for a kiss you 're still beautiful kenny tells her at one point she answers come to me do n't make me beg audiences have seen this sort of thing before in stephen frears 's film the grifters but the characters anjelica huston and john cusack played were fictional irene silverman played with enormous charm and sympathy by jean stapleton had divided her huge town house into elegant suites which she rented to friends of friends in the film kenny manages to become one of her boarders at 6000 a month under an assumed name by lying about having a mutual friend and promising to bring in his identification later sante soon moves in posing as her son 's personal assistant they spend their time plotting the murder after faking papers that transfer ownership of the house to them and practicing it you have to admire arthur allan seidelman 's direction when he has the couple laughing like children as sante plays the role of the corpse paul eric meyers 's script spares us a depiction of the murder as the house empties out for the fourth of july weekend mrs silverman dismisses a friend 's concerns for her i 'm like a tea bag she reassures the friend i get stronger in hot water soon sante and kenny are seen carrying a body size package to their car taking a human life does n't appear to faze sante she seems unable to recognize that any of the things she does are wrong her only moments of regret are about having aged which makes her less effective in conning men ms moore is 64 a year older than sante kimes was in 1998 but it takes granny glasses a dowdy hairstyle and less than kind lighting to make her look it like mother like son the strange story of sante and kenny kimes cbs sunday night at 9 channel 2 in new york arthur allan seidelman director paul eric meyers writer frank konigsberg and drew smith producers mary tyler moore sue pollock scott brazil and larry garrison executive producers produced by the konigsberg smith company with mary tyler moore sante kimes jean stapleton irene silverman robert forster ken kimes and gabriel olds kenny kimes
