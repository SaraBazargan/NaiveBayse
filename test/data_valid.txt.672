helen dixon winters calif august 1955 i was feeling terrible it was both the heat and the pregnancy just a short while after that i gave birth to my second son who was 11 pounds i was wondering if this should be just the normal birth especially since he was such a large baby or whether i should have a caesarean you have funny feelings in those last few weeks you just can hardly wait until the birth dorothea photographed all the time you got used to it she was my mother in law and i admired a lot of things she did i admired her tenacity because she was sick so much of the time but we were building that house at the time dorothea had an awful lot of input that caused kind of friction and so i got to the point where i really hated the house between pregnancy and all of that it just got to be so much i ca n't say that i love that photograph simply because i was so miserable at the time interview by catherine saint louis correction november 5 2000 sunday a credit was omitted in the times magazine on oct 22 for a portrait of helen dixon daughter in law of the photographer dorothea lange it should have read copyright dorothea lange collection oakland museum of california city of oakland gift of paul s taylor
