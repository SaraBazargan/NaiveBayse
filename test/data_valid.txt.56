expecting a shower of gold at the end of the month when new budget surplus estimates are released vice president al gore said today that he would offer americans 500 billion in tax cuts over 10 years the amount is twice what mr gore had proposed earlier and half of what his republican rival gov george w bush of texas has proposed mr gore has been extremely critical of mr bush 's proposal saying that the nation can not afford it and that vital programs and entitlement benefits would have to be cut to pay for it gore aides said the chief difference between their proposals was that the vice president 's tax cuts would be limited primarily to families with children and aging parents mr bush 's income tax cut of 13 trillion over 10 years would apply to everybody across the board mr gore is basing his proposal on the expectation that the federal budget surplus outside of social security already forecast to range from 750 billion to 2 trillion will expand by perhaps 1 trillion he had already proposed the broad outlines of most of the tax cuts but today he offered estimates of how much money he would devote to each in a discussion at a food warehouse here the presumptive democratic nominee said his plan would cover long term care college tuition day care relief for parents who stay at home with infants and relief from the so called marriage penalty which has long been proposed by republicans the tax credits he outlined today would make up to 10000 in college tuition costs tax deductible give care givers a 3000 tax credit to help care for elderly parents provide a tax credit for after school programs and make the existing child care tax credit refundable another part of the 500 billion would include tax free retirement accounts to supplement social security the details of which he said he would discuss next week this tax relief package for middle income families can help to solve the most important challenges that families face today mr gore said this package big as it is stands in sharp contrast to an alternative that would completely eliminate the budget surplus and threaten the underlying prosperity the discussion here in lockland a cincinnati suburb of about 4400 people came on the third day of mr gore 's progress and prosperity tour which is designed to take the vice president to battleground states and give him a chance to highlight the booming economy and take some credit for it the tour is premised on mr gore 's belief that the economy is his trump card in the election he says the unprecedented growth in the economy has given the nation the luxury of talking about big ideas though on his tour he has mostly offered new ways of spending the swelling surplus rather than wrestled with philosophical choices but mr gore is also proposing ways to make money at two fund raisers in new york on wednesday night he gave a mini preview of a speech on the environment that he plans to make the week after next when he will argue as president clinton has that protecting the environment does not have to mean sacrificing the economy and that in fact money can be made off cleaning up the environment in the third week of this series of speeches i 'm going to be talking about how we can create millions of good new jobs by investing in the new technologies that are far more efficient that will position us to be more competitive that will put us in first place in the 21st century in making and selling the kind of products that people all over the world in crowded polluted cities are trying to buy he told one group of campaign donors
