if richard gephardt goes through with plans to pass up another term as house minority leader it could provide an opportunity for the democrats to figure out exactly what they intend to stand for during the upcoming period of republican domination on both sides of congress mr gephardt certainly ca n't be blamed for everything that went wrong on tuesday but there 's nothing like a bad election night to get a party focused on its identity problems both parties actually should be careful about the lessons they draw from the election president bush has a right to be a very happy man this week it was his willingness to put his prestige on the line in three weeks of tireless well aimed campaigning that won the day for his party nevertheless he would be mistaken to read too much into the results the president 's personal popularity coupled with his party 's savvy campaign strategy certainly could become the basis for a solid republican majority in the future but it is not there yet on tuesday the country continued to be split almost exactly down the middle the democrats two most crippling losses occurred in minnesota and missouri where the voting margins narrowed to practically nothing obviously a narrow win is better than a narrow loss but mr bush has a habit of interpreting even the tiniest margins of victory as mandates for sweeping change the last time around he seized on an election in which he lost the popular vote as justification for pressing forward with a lopsided tax plan and other programs beloved by business interests and the conservative gop base now having run to the center in order to win their critical races the republicans will be tempted to embark on an aggressively conservative agenda saddling the country with right wing judges for the next 30 years or resurrecting some of their more repellent energy strategies like opening up the arctic national wildlife refuge for oil drilling the democrats for their part do n't seem to be having much problem taking their defeats seriously the one thing the party had plenty of yesterday was self criticism although there did n't seem to be a large supply of people willing to take personal responsibility for the loss of control of the senate and the increased republican majority in the house nancy pelosi the house minority whip said the democrats had failed utterly to distinguish themselves from the opposition representative martin frost of texas who like ms pelosi wants to be a candidate for the leader 's job if mr gephardt steps aside was arguing that the election proved the country was moving to the right and that the democrats needed to follow suit democrats are certainly frustrated by republicans skill at co opting the rhetorical center but it does n't take a genius to realize that a party that wants to run on the nation 's economic problems needs to have a coherent economic strategy first instead of explaining to the public why they felt long term tax cuts for the wealthy were a bad idea most democrats in tight races either dodged the issue or voted with the president mr bush 's political genius has always been in defining a narrow list of issues he supports and then sticking to his message the democrats could do the same thing rallying behind their popular positions on the environment and social security but they must also figure out whether they are a party that disapproves of huge long term tax cuts for the wealthiest sliver of the american population if they ca n't agree on that one there will be good reason for the rest of the country to wonder what exactly they stand for
