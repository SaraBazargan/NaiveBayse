when slobodan milosevic emerged in public last week live and in color to be re elected president of his socialist party of serbia he sent a little shiver down a lot of spines but mr milosevic is today considered more of a spent force than a threat less the evil plotter than someone who still does n't understand quite what hit him on sept 24 when serbs voted for vojislav kostunica and then banded together to pull down the old regime nonetheless the socialists are still expected to be the largest opposition party after serbia 's crucial elections on dec 23 getting up to 15 percent of the vote but even senior american officials believe that having mr milosevic as its president will delay any revival of the party in fact yugoslavia has moved to a new stage with a new hidden drama the effort of mr kostunica the federal president to translate his extraordinary popularity as a hero of democracy into enduring political power in serbia where real power lies according to all the opinion polls the 18 party coalition behind mr kostunica should gain a big majority in the december voting but it is a diverse bunch and strains between mr kostunica and his coalition ally and political rival zoran djindjic are expected to break the coalition apart within a year ever since the serbs forced mr milosevic to resign on oct 6 however the west has been tripping over itself to help mr kostunica and the prospect of a normal benign serbia western leaders have provided him quick emergency aid and swallowed any criticism of his performance in vienna at last week 's meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe the slightly rumpled mr kostunica was greeted like a star with even austria 's jorg haider attending a lunch in his honor but as federal president mr kostunica is formally in charge of the military foreign relations and the air traffic system and not much else the serbian government controls most of everyday life including the police both secret and regular and it is mr djindjic as the leader of the largest party in the coalition who is expected to become serbian prime minister mr kostunica has already succeeded in demanding the same number of seats on the coalition 's parliamentary list for his once marginal party as mr djindjic will get for his much larger one but mr kostunica will be able only to influence events in serbia not control them that is because mr kostunica is the president of a legal entity yugoslavia whose existence is something of a collective illusion and whose main constituent parts are restive or in flux kosovo the majority albanian province of serbia run by the united nations and nato led troops is increasingly explosive with armed albanian militants infiltrating serbia and killing policemen montenegro serbia 's sister republic is still pressing for independence despite mr milosevic 's fall to the intense annoyance of the same west that backed montenegro so lavishly when it seemed a little anti milosevic aircraft carrier serbia with 95 percent of the population is being run by a shaky provisional government full of milosevic supporters which is why the elections matter so much washington and the west do not want yugoslavia to fall apart first because it would leave mr kostunica whose probity has impressed them essentially jobless and second because its further breakup would create new crises and expectations for independence in the region not just in kosovo and montenegro but in the republika srpska the serb dominated part of bosnia and herzegovina and a deeply divided macedonia the battle to come is still djindjic kostunica said a senior european diplomat in belgrade where the parlor game is to guess along what lines the democratic coalition will split come january with an active functioning government in serbia kostunica and the federal government are going to look very pale a lot of the donor community including governments might prefer to deal with djindjic mr djindjic is also a democrat with a history of opposition so what 's the problem in fact the two men distrust each other intensely with the quiet legally minded mr kostunica regarding the elegant entrepreneurial mr djindjic as unreliable and even unscrupulous that is a worry shared by many who admire mr djindjic 's organizational skills and who fear along with mr djindjic that mr kostunica is too professorial and indecisive and has not moved quickly enough to dismantle the old regime aleksandar tijanic a slashing writer and analyst summarizes the problem neatly if a bit unfairly kostunica regards parliament as a cathedral mr tijanic said djindjic regards it as a casino for the moment however the test for mr kostunica has been kosovo where albanian militants in the presevo valley of serbia have been trying to provoke him into overreacting with military force as mr milosevic did so often undermining belgrade 's newly friendly relations with the west mr kostunica 's enemies like mr milosevic were quick to exploit the violence and call it a sign of serbia 's new weakness mr djindjic too unpopular for his ties to nato countries in the kosovo war was quick to portray himself as a serbian patriot warning loudly that serbia would defend itself mr kostunica understood he had to be seen to threaten force but could not use it so the army moved tanks to the border of the security zone from which the kosovo peace agreement bans them and brought journalists down to film their resolve next he tried to turn the crisis into a test for the west in vienna he criticized nato and the united nations for failing to do their job in kosovo while urging them to seal the border nato and western officials eager to help him and nervous about renewed albanian militancy promised a new crackdown even secretary of state madeleine k albright whom serbs regard as the champion of the bombing campaign against them a campaign mr kostunica opposed praised him she assured his foreign minister that american forces would do all they could to rein in the very fighters they called allies less than a year ago in kosovo everyone wants to get kostunica and the democrats past this election a senior western official said if anyone says they 're thinking much beyond dec 23 they 're lying
