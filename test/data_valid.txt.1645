rick fox stood in the middle of a humid lakers locker room at arco arena in sacramento on sunday night patting sweat from his brow they humbled us in a lot of ways he said of the sacramento kings they fought admirably they really did in less than 48 hours the los angeles lakers won two elimination games over the kings of all phil jackson 's eight championship teams none had been tested more than the group that found the resolve to repel the kings in a memorable game 7 it was only the second time since 1982 the 76ers over the celtics that a visiting team won a game 7 in the conference finals the lakers proved they could trail in a game for 47 minutes 59 seconds and still win but shaquille o'neal did not put on the western conference champion t shirt or hat after their 112 106 overtime victory he wanted the big prize which means their third nba title in three seasons it was n't pretty fox said but we still have the heart of a champion we know how to win at this time of year so the lakers move on to face the nets a series that feels a little like wading through the trailers after watching three scintillating hours of titanic it may go five games possibly six if the nets can swipe a game in los angeles the drama might even make people tune in but it will be nothing like the last two weeks the breathless finishes kobe bryant and shaq 's bling bling dynasty on the brink mike bibby 's bedeviling the defending champions in six weeks bibby went from chris webber 's sidekick to the league 's new money postseason player he showed up nonchalantly at the premiere of undercover brother hoping to sneak a peak at the hollywood crowd last week before game 6 in los angeles bibby was besieged more than any movie star denise richards actually sought him out the kings will be ok you know positives are gon na grow out of it webber said flowers grow out of manure where do the kings go from here yesterday a major hangover permeated sacramento a local broadcaster bemoaned her new prospective assignment nights spent covering the river cats the oakland a 's class aaa affiliate who employ the former yankees bob geren manager and roy white hitting coach the players were visibly crushed after the game waiting nearly 30 minutes to gather themselves and speak to reporters bobby jackson said it felt as if his team 's heart had been ripped out there had so many chances if vlade divac does not bat the ball out to robert horry in game 4 for a game winning 3 pointer the kings go up by 3 1 in the series and have three chances to take one game if a couple of calls go their way at the end of game 6 they would have closed out the lakers last friday if the kings do not miss 14 of 30 free throws or lose a 2 point lead in the final two minutes the nets are in sacramento today looking back for the kings is only going to hurt because they outplayed the lakers for much of the series but looking ahead might help ease the pain this idea that this was the kings best chance to dethrone the lakers does not hold weight webber is just hitting his prime and bibby as great as he was at age 24 will not be there for another couple of years divac still has a few good years left peja stojakovic is 25 hedo turkoglu is 23 and nearly everyone is under contract rather than view the kings like the recent portland trail blazers they more resemble the crestfallen detroit pistons teams of isiah thomas 's youth the pistons outplayed the celtics in 1987 but could not close them out a year later they finally got past their nemesis only to lose a heartbreaking seven game final against the lakers it was not until 1989 that they conquered all their playoff demons and completed the journey the computerized message system for webber 's cellphone yesterday said his mailbox was full no doubt condolences his supporters should save their breath webber proved himself during these playoffs even though he only made 3 of his last 10 shots on sunday he is more of a point forward than a power forward able to morph into a playmaker from all sides of the court his only glaring weakness as a player is his inability to create his own shot when the defense stiffens he is not haunted by playoff failures or hung up about playing under pressure he simply needs to add more to his arsenal than the jump hook the underhand scoop and an 18 footer his journey continues this summer when he has the opportunity to work on his game and come back with the same resolve that the lakers had in the final two minutes the notion that no other king wanted to take a shot other than bibby at the end of the game is a popular one but on the other end it was considered blasphemous to basketball to give the ball to anyone other than o'neal or bryant the lakers were riding their horses the kings were riding theirs in this series bibby nearly shot the lakers down in game 7 so why not keep going to the well till it runs dry criticism of webber is like outdated criticism of patrick ewing when all is said and done their franchises are not moving on in the playoffs without them maybe the best advice to beat the lakers came from a hard featured elderly gentleman interviewed on the local news after his beloved kings lost pete carril needs to work with these guys on their foul shooting in the off season he said of the former princeton coach and the kings assistant we make our free throws we 're winning the championship until the summit is reached the journey can be perilous in the meantime the kings taught the lakers an invaluable lesson it was not until their season was almost gone that they realized how much it meant to be a champion
