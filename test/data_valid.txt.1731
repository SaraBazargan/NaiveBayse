venus williams did what she could she called for the trainer when her body started to hurt in yet another place she kept serving for the lines she read through her notebook of tennis reminders on changeovers head down stay down racket speed but for the first time in quite a long time all her talent athleticism combativeness and fall back plans were not enough williams 's 24 match victory streak is over monica seles 's 18 match streak is still alive as a result of her 6 7 4 6 2 6 3 triumph seles will face martina hingis in the australian open semifinals that should come as no great surprise considering seles 's history of success in melbourne she has won four of her nine grand slam singles titles on the high bouncing surface here and her emotional triumph in 1996 is the only major title she has won since she was stabbed in the back by a spectator at the height of her powers seles came back long ago but she has never resumed being dominant and until tuesday night she was 0 6 against williams yet this was their first meeting in a grand slam event there 's no guarantee seles said just because venus beat me in the past or because i beat let 's say cara black three times does n't mean that i 'm going to beat her this time and i think all of us out there have learned our lessons that we 've lost to players that we never have before it happens the other women 's semifinal is also a rematch the last time jennifer capriati and kim clijsters traded deep ground strokes was during last year 's french open final capriati won in a marathon to claim her second grand slam title of the year now they will meet again after capriati 's dominant 6 2 6 2 victory over amelie mauresmo tonight and clijsters 's 6 2 6 3 dismissal of her belgian rival justine henin i think we 're sort of like a mirror of each other capriati said of the 18 year old clijsters what i remember from the french is that what she gave me i gave her back and vice versa she 's a great mover around the court and a great fighter and her ground strokes are big it 's like i do n't know who 's going to win by two points or one point neither williams nor seles played close to her best tuesday williams who had overcome a recurrence of left knee tendinitis earlier in the tournament strained her right hamstring midway through the opening set and left the court to be taped at 4 4 seles said she woke up on this morning with cold symptoms including a fever but with the exception of the first set tie breaker seles hit through crises with more aplomb in particular an 0 40 deficit on her serve with a 4 3 lead in the final set it was such a seesaw match and to come and pull through it and to stay really focused at the end was really good seles said one or two service games really helped me there i was pretty lucky to end up winning from being 0 40 down it was seles 's most significant victory in a major since she defeated hingis who was then no 1 en route to the 1998 french open final the third seeded hingis advanced to the final four by beating the persistent but underpowered adriana serra zanetti 6 2 6 3 hingis who missed the end of last season because of an ankle surgery has yet to lose more than three games in a set in her five matches here although she has yet to face the sort of power player that has troubled her in recent years seles will give her plenty of pace and while hingis holds a 12 4 career edge she has lost their last two meetings which both came on california hardcourts last august that was the beginning of seles 's latest revival and though she was upset in the third round of the united states open by daja bedanova she won three minor tournaments in the fall free at last of pain in her chronically tender feet after struggling to find a steady coach since the death of her father karolj in 1998 she has been working regularly with mike sell since last year it 's been really nice to have someone that i can count on seles said i think that has been the most difficult thing throughout my career since my father passed away seles has indeed had more than her share of heartache something not lost on her opponents even opponents seven years her junior who have not lost a match since last august i have yet to find the best part of losing williams said but under the circumstances maybe it was the best thing for me maybe i would have tried to play the next match maybe i would n't have but i think more than anything she had the game plan today and she deserved to win who knows what will happen maybe she 'll take the whole slam home and that would be an exciting story in the men 's event thomas johansson of sweden and jiri novak of the czech republic both advanced to a semifinal that only the most imaginative observer would have predicted before this tournament began the 16th seeded johansson at his best on hardcourts defeated his good friend and davis cup teammate jonas bjorkman by 6 0 2 6 6 3 6 4 novak made impressively quick work of the tenacious baseliner stefan koubek 6 2 6 3 6 2 neither johansson nor novak who are both 26 and were born two days apart has advanced to this lofty phase of a grand slam event before with the retractable roofs on the two main arenas closed the indoor conditions suited johansson perfectly but bjorkman also a fine and experienced indoor player would prefer to let the elements dictate the schedule it definitely is a totally different tournament playing under the roof he said i honestly think there should n't be a roof because it gives the tournament two faces i can understand the point of view that it 's hard with tv and for the people the crowd but wimbledon has done that for many many years and the people come back and are patient match points in the men 's quarterfinals the south african veteran wayne ferreira had to abort his mission after only seven games retiring with an abdominal muscle injury while trailing 2 5 against no 9 seeded marat safin safin the 2000 united states open champion who beat pete sampras in the fourth round will next face marcelo rios or tommy haas
