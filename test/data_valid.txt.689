while louis andriessen and peter greenaway 's writing to vermeer plays at the new york state theater beginning on tuesday as part of the lincoln center festival the creators first opera rosa of 1994 can also be heard thanks to a new recording nonesuch 79559 2 two cd 's there compensation for the lack of mr greenaway 's visual contribution comes in the cover design featuring a typically energetic and economically brushed horse by susan rothenberg the image is suitable for a horse is in some ways the central character of the opera though to be sure it does not sing and certainly the central symbol where at one crucial point a live black horse is meant to be lowered onto the stage the music for the first time loses its smart emphatic momentum to become a chain of quiet foggy chords in high strings one does not need to see the action to know that something ominous is going on trapped on a treadmill the horse is caught in a frame of work and dependence just like the human characters esmeralda the wife of the composer juan manuel de rosa was treated by him as an animal by her own account which is all the opera provides partly because rosa is dead before the start of the action but rosa too was a victim not only in having been shot but also before that in having had to write music for westerns mr andriessen and mr greenaway seem to view this as debasement for an artist and the references mr andriessen makes to movie music in the score are short and cheerless he must also have been aware of being in the same position as rosa composing music to the orders of a film man as those orders are represented by mr greenaway 's formal and unnerving libretto but for him the more irksome constraints are elsewhere as in earlier works mr andriessen interprets the creative life in social terms and skeptically the artist in modern society is like a workhorse expected to produce an output steadily and in one direction hence the atmosphere of compulsion and resentment that pervades rosa as it does many of mr andriessen 's works his music is as strongly pulsed short phrased and repetitive as philip glass 's but it comes out of a sourer and darker harmonic world and like kurt weill 's it uses jazz band sonorities to convey unease and decay there is a sense of pacing or more often running in place of being indeed on a treadmill the opening orchestral music insistent and edgy marked by a characteristic welding of saxophone and piano keeps rushing and unpredictably stopping as if in search of an escape that will never be found when voices enter the messages they deliver are at first bleak and disillusioning chorus and soloists spend a long time just describing the stage and explaining that it now represents the floor of a slaughterhouse gradually the speed of events quickens right through the continuous two hours of the piece though the music 's speed of fettered allegro stays largely the same gradually too elements of narrative are set in place more or less securely they are elements appropriate to an opera elements of love and death rosa a composer with a passion for horses and a job in the movies has been shot while riding esmeralda comes from a family of slaughterhouse owners and has complained to her mother of rosa 's debasing behavior toward her various clues are presented and various suspects including esmeralda 's brothers there is also an investigator or as she is called investigatrix she comes to no definite solution but the evidence points to a mysterious death by misadventure rosa was killed as he rode off into one of his own movies where perhaps as an artist he had been dying all along the opera is dominated by two sopranos who have to contribute a lot by their sensuality and swing to establish mr andriessen 's view of the opera house as another kind of nightclub and who have to move through various other roles before they eventually become identified as esmeralda and the investigatrix both marie angel and miranda van kralingen meet the demands with vigor and enthusiasm lyndon terracini sings the flashbacks for rosa who is rather pushed into a corner by these vocally well endowed and self confident women reinbert de leeuw conducts as he will also do writing to vermeer at lincoln center the players of the asko ensemble and the schonberg ensemble keep up tension through the long passages of similar driving music and are excellent too in those rare sequences where the score becomes slow refined and delicate
