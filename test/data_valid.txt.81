to the editor i have dined at acacia at least 50 times and have always found the food and service to be excellent while the hostess appears to be in need of some attitude adjustment i found ms cook 's reporting of the comment that acacia is too upscale for apple pie as unnecessary and unfair since it was likely made in jest more importantly the reviewer expresses some arrogant attitude of her own when she recommends that the chef brian brodowski stop cooking in italics i recommend that ms cook should stop trying to be clever at the chef 's expense glenn parker skillman
