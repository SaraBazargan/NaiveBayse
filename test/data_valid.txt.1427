to the editor re un inspectors can return unconditionally iraq says front page sept 17 it is good news that iraq will allow the return of united nations inspectors without conditions but the inspectors will confront the insoluble problem of proving the negative that is that iraq is not violating its obligations not to have or acquire weapons of mass destruction not finding weapons or production facilities will not prove that there are none the inspectors will be able to come close to reaching that conclusion only if iraq cooperates fully this is a situation in which only the accused knows how to prove what it is not doing and iraq should be made to do that therefore the security council should require iraq to prove that it is complying with its arms control obligations lawrence s finkelstein hollis nh sept 17 2002
