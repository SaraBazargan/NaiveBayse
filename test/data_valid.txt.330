joe jurevicius the former giants wide receiver has been a quiet contributor in the tampa bay buccaneers offensive resurgence this season but his availability for tampa bay 's nfc title game against the eagles on sunday became a bigger question mark today when he did not practice for the third straight day the buccaneers are hopeful that jurevicius whose wife meagan gave birth prematurely this week can join the team in philadelphia on saturday the child due to be born in february is experiencing some health complications buccaneers officials said coach jon gruden said that while the buccaneers thought jurevicius would play on sunday at the same time we respect his situation and we 're supporting him jurevicius who left the giants as a free agent in the off season to sign with tampa bay attended team meetings thursday morning before leaving to be with his wife knowing joe and you do get to know your guys after a while if there 's any way he can find a way to play he 'll play gruden said he 's prepared mentally and physically we know he 's ready to go jurevicius signed with tampa knowing that he would be the team 's third receiver behind the former jet keyshawn johnson and keenan mccardell who was acquired as a free agent from jacksonville but i think the sky 's the limit for the guy the bucs wide receivers coach richard mann said of jurevicius he 's done everything we 've asked and he 's made plays he 's a guy we need and he knows it mann tells his receivers that when their turn eventually comes the best thing they can do to ensure more playing time is to perform so well that the coaches do n't want to take them out joe is doing that he said jurevicius play was conspicuous against the san francisco 49ers in the divisional playoffs last sunday he caught 3 passes for 48 yards including a 20 yard touchdown that helped ignite tampa bay which has been averaging 27 points a game in the last seven games that quarterback brad johnson has started jurevicius also drew an interference penalty on safety tony parrish for 36 yards setting up a touchdown in the buccaneers 31 6 victory i really think joe 's got a chance to be a bright star here in tampa before he 's done gruden said he really sets the mold on what we 're looking for he 's a hard worker he 's big and physical he can run after the catch and he 's a finisher gruden paused a moment then added we need to find more for joe to do honestly he needs to play more the buccaneers appear to have signed jurevicius at the right time with his career distinctly in ascent in his four seasons with the giants he showed improvement each year he went from catching 9 passes his first season to 18 his second then to 24 in his third season and 51 in his last he started a career high nine games in the 2001 season totaling 706 yards with 3 touchdowns this season as tampa bay 's third receiver except for two starts he finished with 37 catches for 423 yards and 4 touchdowns the game against san francisco put an accent on his season showing that he has become one of tampa bay 's prime receiving threats he 's our x factor brad johnson said of jurevicius he 's a very dominant receiver he makes grabs and catches and he 's a physical receiver the great thing about joe he makes yards after the catch at 6 feet 5 inches and 230 pounds jurevicius has such a physical presence that the buccaneers use him in running situations as well as passing ones he 's a vital part of our running game mann said if jurevicius who played at penn state can not play sunday the veteran receiver karl williams will replace him that could present a precipitous drop off in production for tampa bay williams had 7 catches for 77 yards this season
