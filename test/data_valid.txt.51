the republican presidential candidates are all more or less calling for a foreign policy they see as reminiscent of president ronald reagan engaging with the world but unilaterally with a narrow interpretation of american national interests and although the republicans have criticized president clinton as watering down united states influence by working through multilateral groups mr clinton recently shocked american allies by also seeming to embrace unilateralism in seattle he backed off from firm support of the world trade organization our current foreign policy debate is not over whether to retreat into isolationism but over how we should relate to the rest of the world polls show that the large majority of americans do not want to turn inward but neither do they want to be the world 's policeman what is missing in the campaign rhetoric is any acknowledgment of something ronald reagan understood well america 's soft power hard power is exercised through economic sanction or military force soft power is our ability to get what we want through attraction rather than coercion when other countries want the same outcome we want then we can get what we want without having to spend as much on coercion both dimensions of power are important and they work best when they reinforce each other one source of soft power is our values to the extent that we are seen as a beacon of liberty human rights and democracy others are attracted to follow our lead to the extent that we fail to live up to our proclaimed standards and seem like hypocrites others are less willing to follow thus the quality of our domestic life prosperity social safety nets equal access to justice democratic elections has a strong impact on our international position presidents eisenhower and kennedy recognized four decades ago for example that racial segregation at home undercut our foreign policy the attraction of american universities for the half million foreign students who study in them each year is another source of our soft power not all go home satisfied but most gain a more realistic and positive appraisal of our country than they could get from home for example at a time when chinese government propaganda was lambasting us a former student in this country who was the son of a high chinese official published a book widely read in beijing that described the united states positively another source of our soft power is cultural exports films and television programs art and academic writing and material on the internet not everyone is attracted to the values portrayed in our popular culture some iranian officials say that to understand what they mean by the great satan one need merely watch mtv but watching mtv is exactly what many young iranians want to do soft power also works through international organizations like the international monetary fund nato or the inter american human rights commission to the extent that they shape the agenda of choices for other countries in ways that are compatible with our interests they enhance our soft power when others see our power as morally based it is more effective this is the point that ronald reagan 's would be disciples do not get it is not enough for the united states merely to proclaim that we are right others must see it that way too mr reagan 's task was easier because most countries saw us as preferable in the cold war but he nonetheless negotiated treaties with the soviet union and maintained american leadership in the united nations whatever the balance of costs and benefits of the comprehensive test ban treaty there was a significant cost to our soft power in the senate 's rejection of it and the manner of the rejection similarly when we are seen as a bully that extends our laws for example on trade with iran or cuba into the jurisdiction of our allies we also diminish our soft power the german journalist josef joffe points out that historically when one country is preponderant the desire of others to balance its power leads them to team up against it he asks why this has not yet happened to the united states one reason he cites is american soft power others do not see us as a threat but rather as an attraction recently however comments from europe have begun to echo the french line that an american hyperpower is a threat that must be checked and balanced what a pity it would be if the unilateralist rhetoric of an election year led us to squander our soft power and to feed our enemies joseph s nye is dean of harvard university 's kennedy school of government and a former assistant secretary of defense
