it came down to one play if successful fordham would upset st john 's if fordham failed st john 's a highly talented team that was not playing up to those talents would escape point guard bevon robin made his shot which was something between a driving layup and a jump hook shot and 37 seconds later the rams had a 68 67 victory many in the pro fordham crowd of 8368 rushed to the madison square garden floor bob hill the fordham coach bounced onto the floor pumped his fists and then walked quickly to the locker room because he said i wanted the players to celebrate because it 's their team fordham 5 1 had built its record with difficult victories over second tier teams st john 's 4 3 which has yet to start its big east season has played tougher teams and is ranked 24th in the associated press news media poll and in the espn usa today coaches poll it had won 27 of its last 28 games against fordham and was a solid favorite going in but the red storm which starts three freshmen allowed fordham to hang around and the rams ended the first half with an 11 0 run and a 37 31 lead st john 's caught up went ahead and built a 65 58 lead with 4 minutes 30 seconds left in the second half the end hardly fordham with an 8 0 run eased to a 66 65 lead with 1 39 left st john 's got two free throws from willie shaw with 184 seconds left and went ahead by a point the end not yet during a timeout hill called for a middle pick and roll robin would dribble downcourt get a pick from arseni kuchinsky a 6 foot 7 senior forward from belarus and try to drive to the basket robin was guarded by st john 's point guard omar cook and kuchinsky by anthony glover robin dribbled to the frontcourt kuchinsky set the pick as he had done successfully all game robin made a cut off the pick to the right glover did what he had been taught switch to the man with the ball so now it was robin against glover a 6 2 guard against a 6 6 forward robin was just where he wanted to be did i think i was quicker than glover robin said of his teammate at rice high school in manhattan definitely i played against him and with him in high school and i knew he 's not that quick what happened next was largely a result of sheer determination robin put his shoulder down and got a half step on glover as hill put it he forced his will on that play so now robin had a shot except for the menacing presence of mohamed diakite st john 's 6 10 freshman center from mali diakite might have blocked a layup so robin lofted a little jump hook high off the backboard it went in cleanly and when shaw of st john 's missed a desperation 3 point shot at the buzzer the jump hook or whatever it was became the deciding shot hill in his second season as fordham 's coach told a story about the genesis of that shot when i came here hill said i asked bevon 'can you shoot a baby hook he said 'what 's a baby hook but that 's what he shot today as robin described it you just try to get it up high off the glass so if you miss someone would tip it in glover was disappointed with the way his st john 's team played he cited a lack of focus saying we listen but i think it goes in one end and goes out the other on robin 's winning basket glover offered no excuses i thought i had him stopped glover said he got around me he 's a point guard and that 's what good point guards do go to the basket mike jarvis the st john 's coach was philosophical the shot was meant to be he said rebounds bevon robin 17 points 8 rebounds 7 assists and 3 steals and duke freeman mckamey 10 points and 11 rebounds paced fordham anthony glover had 18 points and 9 rebounds and willie shaw scored 18 points for st john 's in the first game of the doubleheader manhattan 3 3 overcame st peter 's 1 5 73 67 in a metro atlantic athletic conference matchup the difference was the free throw shooting 12 of 14 of von damien green the jaspers 5 foot 10 point guard st peter 's kamaal mcqueen scored 20 points
