i met tom seven days before he died he was transferred to our hospital with the slim hope that he could receive a combined heart liver transplant donor organs never became available he died during a desperate resuscitation attempt in our intensive care unit his unnaturally bronzed 55 year old body barely visible beneath a tangled mass of tubes lines and wires but ultimately tom did not die because of the technical limitations of medical hardware rather he died because two decades ago when his first symptoms appeared no one thought to search for their underlying cause tom was in his early 30 's when he lost interest in sex and was bothered by achy joints he saw his doctor who found tom 's testosterone level to be extremely low tom was started on testosterone treatment as well as over the counter anti inflammatory medication for the arthritis tom 's libido returned and his joints improved the medications seemed to work gradually tom 's skin became darker he attributed this to a tan though he spent little time in the sun a year ago he noticed difficulty exercising his abdomen began to swell and when he could take only a few steps before becoming short of breath he came to the hospital tom 's condition was diagnosed as hemochromatosis a surprisingly common genetic disorder in which iron builds up in various tissues when the accumulation is in the pituitary gland the testosterone level can be affected accumulation in the joints leads to arthritis accumulation in the skin darkens the complexion iron can also poison the heart and the liver gravely compromising their function this was what happened to tom his heart was no longer able to pump blood effectively his liver was no longer able to detoxify the blood properly or make the factors necessary for blood clotting the surgeon who opened tom 's chest during the resuscitation effort said simply he was bleeding from everywhere one of every 300 americans is estimated to have hemochromatosis although many do not have any apparent symptoms hemochromatosis was first described by dr armand trousseau a parisian physician in 1865 the gene responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis was identified in 1996 but scientists are still not sure how mutations in the gene designated hfe cause the symptoms while scientists struggle to understand the molecular subtleties of hemochromatosis the clinical treatment of the disorder remains remarkably primitive serial phlebotomy that is weekly bloodletting it turns out that removing about a pint of blood a week can prevent excess iron from accumulating and if started early enough can often reverse disease symptoms if tom 's disease had been diagnosed and phlebotomy begun two decades ago he might have required testosterone therapy but he could have avoided the progression of the disease to his liver and his heart in other words if someone had thought to ask why a young healthy man should suddenly have low testosterone levels and arthritis tom might have been saved unfortunately tom 's story will probably become more and more common as doctors are compelled to see more patients in less time and are encouraged to order minimal testing there is a pressure to treat patients rather than understand them low potassium level give potassium supplements belly hurt here 's an antacid depressed try prozac and more often then not in the short term the medications we prescribe work we have become very good at alleviating symptoms and correcting laboratory abnormalities we often feel good when this happens and our patients are often grateful indeed this is what many patients expect when they see a doctor a couple of lab tests and a prescription to fix whatever their problem is but if doctors treat only symptoms then we really are just the pill pushers our critics describe as doctors we have been schooled in science precisely so we can try to understand the root causes of a disease and not simply provide a salve for its most troublesome manifestations it is our responsibility to consider what a particular symptom or collection of symptoms may mean and our obligation to avoid the increasingly common reflex to treat and street the patients we encounter the need to look beyond a patient 's immediate clinical symptoms and to search intensively for deeper meaning has been and must always remain a defining quality of the medical profession cases david a shaywitz is an endocrinology fellow at harvard
