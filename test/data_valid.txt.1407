beth israel medical center has agreed to pay 12 million to the federal government to settle civil charges that the hospital improperly billed the medicare program during the early 1990 's the settlement announced by the united states attorney for the southern district of new york stemmed from what its lawyers said were false claims filed by the hospital for inpatient pharmacy costs influenza vaccines and drugs used to treat organ transplant patients were among the medications billed to the medicare program between 1990 and 1995 even though medicare rules state that such pharmacy items are not covered the complaint said the settlement with beth israel is by no means the largest one involving medicare fraud in new york city but it is the largest of its kind involving improper billing of what is known as inpatient ancillary pharmacy items in recent years the southern district has recovered 25 million in this type of case including beth israel and five other centers these settlements demonstrate the federal government 's strong resolve to protect medicare monies and to ensure that they are expended only for legitimate charges said mary jo white the united states attorney for the southern district in a prepared statement under the settlement beth israel is also required to form a compliance committee and perform annual reviews of its billing policies the fraud accusation is the latest in a series of difficulties the hospital has faced in recent years including severe problems with its obstetrics and gynecology department that resulted in a patient 's death in a statement beth israel acknowledged that bills that should have been submitted appropriately to medicaid were instead billed to medicare in the last few years the federal government has become aggressive in pursuing health care fraud from 1997 to 2000 recovery in civil fraud cases grew by more than 50 percent largely driven by health care fraud cases in the last fiscal year which ended june 30 the federal government won 15 billion as a result of fraud cases and 840 million of that was from health care fraud the department of justice said this case is part of an overall theme said keith m korenchuk a health care lawyer for davis wright tremaine a law firm in charlotte nc the whole reimbursement area has been very active and will continue to be very active over the next year or so mr korenchuk who said he had no specific knowledge of the beth israel case added that while many health care centers sought to gain government money through fraud improper billing charges were also often simply errors made by hospital billing departments the federal government has an almost incomprehensible reimbursement system he said and there is the real likelihood of some inadvertent errors made while trying to make a complex system work
