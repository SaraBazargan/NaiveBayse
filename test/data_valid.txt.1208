at age 71 carlos ayala still relishes his ranch nestled here in the foothills of the andes near the colombian border 1700 acres of tall grass and knolls where his sons learned to ride horses and his family celebrated holidays but colombian guerrillas are increasingly crossing into this region in a search for affluent venezuelans to kidnap and extort so mr ayala 's visits are not the same his family does not accompany him and when mr ayala makes the trip he varies his routine and leaves before dark it is on my mind that these guys can come out of nowhere armed and ready to take you said mr ayala who lives in the city of san cristobal like many other ranchers in the region i 'm afraid even though i still go colombian rebels and organized gangs that sell hostages to the rebels have been kidnapping ranchers and businessmen for several years but now are doing so at a record pace about 125 kidnappings are expected this year more than twice as many as last year according to venezuelan government statistics ranching associations and business groups accuse the left leaning government of president hugo chavez of worsening the problem by taking a soft line toward colombia 's rebels while some in mr chavez 's inner circle have harshly criticized the rebels the president has welcomed guerrilla delegates to caracas the capital and declared that colombia 's rebels are not enemies of venezuela there is a tolerance said genaro mendez president of asogata the largest cattlemen 's group in this state tachira the guerrillas even say they have a nonaggression pact between the venezuelan legal authorities and the colombian rebel groups mr mendez said we do not know if that is true but that is what we hear the problem pales in comparison to colombia where 2459 people had been reported kidnapped from january through october but venezuelans are becoming used to rebel abductions of cattlemen and to a lesser extent even high profile cases like the kidnappings of industrialists in caracas more than 500 miles by road from colombia i never thought this was possible in caracas said antonio nagen who was kidnapped there in 1999 taken to colombia and later released when his family paid a ransom how do i see it now he said in a phone interview it can happen anywhere even in church but it is in this area along a porous border with colombia where venezuelans have most to fear three rebel groups along with their right wing paramilitary enemies are active on the other side of the border with many wealthy colombians now avoiding the countryside the rebels often search for victims in venezuela that has prompted venezuelan cattlemen to take steps that would have been considered exaggerated a few years ago hiring bodyguards is a precaution that pedro carvajal whose son was kidnapped and later released counts on when he visits his ranch while sergio guerrero takes a 9 millimeter handgun when he drives the unpaved road to his milk farm just east of san joaquin most ranchers try to make sure that field hands are loyal not informers paid to provide information to kidnappers and that local townspeople know as little as possible about their personal lives we do not spend much time on the farm said edgar pavon 23 who was kidnapped and taken to colombia as a teenager and we do not tell people when we will be arriving practically all the ranchers take the precaution of varying their routines i try to switch things around explained carlos hurado 58 i believe in god but i try to take care of myself the new way of life has been unsettling for a largely peaceful region that had long coexisted with colombia and been influenced by it indeed venezuelans flock across the border to shop in the bustling city of cucuta colombian folk songs dominate the airwaves and colombian food and soccer prevail the rest of venezuela follows baseball colombians have also settled here in droves setting up small businesses or working as field hands the brutal conflict in colombia though has spilled into venezuela in recent years with refugees escaping from the violence and rebels hiding from the army and paramilitary militias of their homeland guerrilla units often relying on venezuelan criminal gangs for help have come to depend on abductions of venezuelans for their finances it has reached the point where local newspapers have had to explain a rebel decree familiar to many colombians which outlines who has to make payoffs to avoid trouble the violent nature of the crisis struck home in late november when venezuelan national guard troops surprised and killed a group of kidnappers here freeing two venezuelan ranchers one longtime rancher said the gunfight was the culmination of months of rebel activity that had included scores of kidnappings the aftershocks have led ranchers to abandon their land some tried to sell but found no buyers the rancher who asked to remain anonymous and others said kidnappers had become so organized and rooted in the region that they knew plenty about a cattleman 's personal life details they used to ensure payment in most cases a ransom is paid but sometimes the victims simply disappear to get the ransom they will come and tell you about your life that you have kids in this school that you have these many bank accounts that you have an apartment in caracas explained another rancher silverio nino and if you do not pay they will tell you 'we know where your 12 year old girl is ranching groups across this state say that most ranchers to avoid trouble simply provide monthly payoffs called vacunas or vaccinations the people prefer to just pay the vacunas and then to just keep quiet about it said pastor cabrera a councilman in abejales about 40 miles from war torn arauca province in colombia and then there are others like mr guerrero who decided not to cooperate and carries his handgun at his 1200 acre ranch several field hands are now armed with shotguns his rambling ranch house is surrounded by a barbed wire fence and four rottweilers guard it as for his handgun i would not think twice about using it he said if someone crosses my path then i have to start firing lead
