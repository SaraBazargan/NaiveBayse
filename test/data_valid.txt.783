honk if you believe this in its annual report about how much time and money is wasted commuting by car to work the texas transportation institute recently lamented that new york area motorists lose 43 hours a year to traffic congestion while philadelphia area commuters lose 44 hours a year together the institute which is based at texas am university estimates that the two metropolitan areas waste 99 billion a year in driving time and fuel costs but new jerseyans should not feel too bad their wasted time is actually below the national average the institute 's figures gathered from several transportation agencies show that nationwide a trip that would take 25 minutes in normal time takes 335 minutes in rush hour traffic but those same trips in the philadelphia and new york areas take less than 32 minutes in rush hour for the 14th consecutive year the los angeles area fared worst in the survey a trip that would take 25 minutes off peak now takes 44 minutes during rush hour robert strauss
