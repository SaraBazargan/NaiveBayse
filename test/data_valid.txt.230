in a regrettable denouement to the clinton impeachment drama a former spokesman for kenneth starr has been charged with criminal contempt in an investigation of news leaks stemming from the monica lewinsky inquiry the former spokesman charles bakaly iii is scheduled to stand trial beginning next week according to recently unsealed court documents at issue is a front page article that appeared in the new york times on jan 31 1999 in the midst of president clinton 's trial before the senate citing several associates of mr starr as sources the article reported that mr starr had concluded that he had constitutional authority to indict a sitting president but had not decided whether or when to seek such an indictment mr bakaly who resigned abruptly from mr starr 's office after an internal investigation of unauthorized disclosures said at the time and has since maintained that he was not a source of the article it is the policy of the times not to discuss sources but as a general matter we look askance at crusades by the federal government to prevent leaks as they are almost always aimed at damming up information the american people are entitled to know rather than safeguarding any legitimate secrets the invocation of the criminal process against mr bakaly is particularly troubling in that the subject matter of the leak the fact that mr starr was considering indicting a sitting president was obviously of great national moment moreover a federal appeals court ruled last september that there was no violation of grand jury secrecy and thus nothing illegal in the discussions mr starr and his aides may have had with reporters about these deliberations either for direct attribution or on a background basis to pursue mr bakaly under these circumstances on charges that he lied to investigators seems unduly punitive and extreme we would have the same view if the dispute involved another newspaper or broadcast news outlet the government is serving no important public interest with this after the fact witch hunt rather this prosecution will chill the news gathering process in a world where the public must rely for crucial information on the willingness of government officials to be forthcoming with reporters
