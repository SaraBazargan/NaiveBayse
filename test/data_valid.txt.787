when the members of the appeals court were writing up their ruling on microsoft did an animated paper clip pop up on their screen bat its eyelashes and say you seem to be writing a legal opinion would you like some help actually we could all use some help here the microsoft case is fundamentally difficult how do you deal with a monopoly when the monopoly is natural when it would exist even in the absence of foul play for even if microsoft had been utterly scrupulous in its conduct which it was n't the force of network externalities the incentives to use the same system that everyone else is using would have given it a monopoly in the operating system market in the past microsoft 's lawyers have made the ludicrous claim that the company is n't a monopoly but the appeals court while rebuking judge thomas penfield jackson for talking out of turn firmly upheld his ruling that what looks and quacks like a monopoly is sure enough a monopoly nonetheless it threw out his proposed remedy to sort through the issues imagine that a new use is found for the internet say a way to transmit smells leading to the discovery that most of the content out there stinks but never mind several companies introduce software so called sniffers that allow users to find and download smell files in the snf format meanwhile however microsoft introduces its own competing proprietary file format sml what rules should be applied to microsoft in this competition at one extreme microsoft could be free to do whatever it wants including introducing a new operating system in which windows media sniffer works but the products of rival companies like aol 's realsniffer do not if microsoft were not a monopolist if it were one of many competing companies offering operating systems this would be legal but it is n't legal given microsoft 's monopoly position which creates a special obligation to provide market openings for competing software applications at the other extreme microsoft could be banned from offering its own sniffer or forced to divest itself of its sniffer division if it already had one this was in effect the remedy demanded by judge jackson who ruled that microsoft must be split into an operating system company and an applications company that is the part of his ruling that has been overturned and with good reason standard economic analysis suggests that while such a vertical breakup of microsoft would increase competition it would do so at considerable cost to consumers so to prevent microsoft from offering a sniffer would be a case of cutting off our nose to spite our face somewhere between these extremes is where the line must now be drawn and the key question is what microsoft can and ca n't do in terms of bundling offering sniffers or other software as a part of the operating system as i understand the court 's ruling microsoft probably could now get away with including a free sniffer as part of the operating system what it could not get away with is including a free sniffer that only reads sml files thereby giving its proprietary file format a tremendous advantage and probably giving its sniffer which is designed for that format a big advantage too now for the bad news even as this case was working its way through the courts bill gates and steve ballmer were still up to their old tricks the next microsoft operating system windows xp contains windows media player which unlike aol 's realplayer apparently will play music and video in microsoft 's proprietary formats but not in those of competitors now i have generally felt that microsoft gets a worse rap than it deserves and i criticized judge jackson 's breakup plan from the start but this looks like sheer arrogance the sort of arrogance that got microsoft in trouble in the first place that arrogance is what drove judge jackson over the edge he concluded that mr gates and his friends could not be trusted that they would always try to find a way around any court order that limited their conduct and that the only way to enforce good behavior was a drastic structural remedy it 's now up to microsoft to prove that he was wrong otherwise we 'll see them back in court and the next judge will keep his mouth shut but carry a big stick
