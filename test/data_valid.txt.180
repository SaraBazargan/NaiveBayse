to the editor nothing better illustrates the profound racial and social class biases in our criminal justice system than your june 17 news article about the student at an elite boarding school who carved a sexual slur into the back of a fellow student a few days after slashing another student he received a suspended sentence and a few years probation compare this egregious example of white middle class privilege with the likely fate of any inner city youth who similarly pleaded guilty to such crimes long years in jail probably in an adult prison the politically seductive campaigns to get tough on juvenile crime cruel misguided and counterproductive to start with are made even more destructive by their racially selective implementation h jack geiger md new york june 18 2000 the writer is professor emeritus of community medicine city university of new york medical school
