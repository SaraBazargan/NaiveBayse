a group of foreign investors in russia 's electricity monopoly unified energy systems has asked president vladimir v putin to stop a corporate restructuring the investors say is moving too fast and would destroy the value of their holdings the group of 18 investors representing more than 15 percent of unified energy 's stock sent a letter to mr putin stating that the restructuring proposal would reduce future investment levels in the energy sector by robbing the company of its principal assets at extremely low prices the identities of all the foreign investors that signed the letter were not immediately clear but people who had seen a copy said it included some of the most prominent names in the asset management business morgan stanley merrill lynch templeton and baring asset management their letter elevates what has been a simmering dispute between foreign investors and the management of unified energy which runs the world 's biggest power grid and is the most actively traded russian stock the restructuring proposal designed by anatoly b chubais unified energy 's chief executive would break the monopoly into hundreds of smaller companies and sell stakes in them to raise 30 billion in badly needed investment over 10 years the company said on monday that it had reworked the proposal and planned to submit the new version to the government on wednesday the restructuring proposal has attracted widespread attention in russia and abroad as a test case for the country 's investment starved energy sector mr chubais was the architect of russia 's state asset sales program in which prize companies were sold at bargain prices and he has championed free market changes and foreign investments in russia as recently as last year mr chubais was a favorite of foreign investors the foreign investors of unified energy even voted to make it more difficult to oust him from the post of chief executive but now some unified energy investors have joined forces against him saying they fear a repeat of his asset sales program within their own company it 's a complete mess said alexander branis associate director at prosperity capital management in moscow with 140 million under management a quarter of which is in power companies i doubt that the proposal has changed much for us it 's disturbing that chubais has admitted that some of our concerns were legitimate but is still pressing ahead unified energy currently holds majority stakes in most of the country 's more than 70 regional power companies and more than 30 federal power plants investors say breaking regional companies up into distributors sellers and generators would create companies too small to attract buyers unified energy should merge groups of regional companies and later sell stakes in the larger companies they say they also contend that russia must allow electricity prices to rise before unified energy 's assets will be attractive to serious buyers tariffs are still well below production costs while unpaid electricity bills cripple the finances of the regional companies russians pay about 15 cents a kilowatt hour for their electricity while western europeans pay about 7 cents company management and shareholders agree that a restructuring is needed they argue that aging regional power stations need new equipment and that companies need the ability to charge market prices for electricity and terminate service to nonpayers unified energy has said the country will suffer major gaps in power supplies without investments in the next five years some market watchers said investors must be willing to give up unified energy 's dominant role charles frank acting president of the european bank for reconstruction and development which invests in post soviet russian companies said last week in st petersburg that some of the criticism of unified energy 's plans was valid but some was driven by a desire to preserve the company 's dominance the unified energy monopoly he said must be broken soon without waiting for the perfect regulatory regime or 100 percent tariff collection
