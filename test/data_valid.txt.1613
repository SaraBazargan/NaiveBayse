wall street 's bull market formally expired monday will the nation 's longest ever expansion follow suit that is the pressing question confronting policy makers and the public at this moment of economic suspense with more than half of all americans now invested in the stock market the federal reserve board and the bush administration face the daunting challenge of preventing the sustained fall in the financial markets from nudging the slowing real economy into a recession the economy has been sending mixed signals of late corporate profits are slowing prominent companies are announcing layoffs and the consumer confidence index is falling last friday the federal reserve reported that the net worth of american households dropped in 2000 for the first time in 55 years and yesterday the commerce department reported weaker than expected retail sales for the month of february but unemployment inflation and productivity figures remain healthy and there are certainly no foreign wars or other external threats to our well being no one has a magic formula for ensuring prosperity but there are important policy tools available and good reasons to believe that a recession is avoidable the white house and the fed as well as congress must now work in concert to prop up consumer confidence the federal reserve must continue to do its part by further dropping interest rates to encourage spending it is important too for president bush to quit talking down the economy in order to build congressional and public support for his tax cut mr bush should take his cue from polls like that in today 's times showing that the public supports his tax cut but views it as skewed toward the rich it would therefore be smart politics and a better test of the stimulative effect of the tax cut to direct it toward wage earning families at the same time democrats and moderate republicans in the senate must ensure that the tax cut is not so large as to risk a return of runaway deficits further undermining consumer confidence on monday the broad based standard poor 's 500 index closed more than 20 percent below its top the classic definition of a bear market and even yesterday 's rebound left it in bear territory of course investors in volatile technology shares had already passed that painful milestone since reaching its peak of 5048 a year ago the nasdaq composite the market index driven by major technology stocks has plummeted more than 3000 points or 60 percent the new economy it seems produced a classic bubble investors lost 4 trillion in paper wealth not to mention their passion for the stock market we are in the aftermath of this spectacular decline but still waiting to learn whether the patient the real economy has suffered just a few bruises or something far more serious how deep and lasting will the ongoing slowdown turn out in the lexicon of wall street are we at the bottom of a v a u or most ominously a japanese style l alan greenspan the fed 's chairman has had a good record in assessing conflicting vital signs the federal reserve must decide by its march 20 meeting whether or most likely how much to further cut interest rates a cut would help address public fears stemming from those trillions of dollars that vanished from the brokerage accounts of millions of americans recessions are typically caused by declines in demand and it is hard to imagine that their stock market losses will not have some impact on people 's spending this is particularly true at a time when americans accustomed to seeing the value of their assets rise dramatically in the past few years have been spending more than they earn public confidence needs to be restored in the fundamental soundness of the economy lest consumers concerns become self fulfilling
