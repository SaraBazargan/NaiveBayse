crime may be generally low in new york city but on the upper west side this month there were echoes of the bad old days compared to july 8 to july 14 last year burglaries in the same week this year shot up 367 percent in the 20th precinct which runs from 60th to 86th streets and from central park to the hudson auto thefts rose 300 percent the following week burglaries were up 500 percent from the 2001 figure before local homeowners panic they should note that the percentages were high because the numbers were low to begin with generally in the single digits still residents were left hoping the crimes were a blip rather than the start of a trend many of the burglaries were apparently committed by two men each working alone one targeted upper floors shimmying through air conditioner openings and skylights while the other targeted lower floors this guy was really hitting us badly joe bolanos president of the precinct 's community council said about the first burglar on one given tuesday he hit four places police arrested two suspects a week apart each during an attempted burglary deputy inspector michael e shea of the 20th precinct said of the crimes it 's what we call a spike no arrests have been made for the car thefts but he said you tend to get patterns of a certain kind of car being stolen lately i would say audis and for some reason minivans the crime rates seem to be returning to normal he said mr bolanos said such sprees crop up every so often just a few weeks ago in fact upper west siders started noticing a dearth of greenery in front of their brownstones the problem was traced to a single person he would take expensive plants or good looking plants mr bolanos said the police spotted the guy going from store to store trying to sell them on broadway tara bahrampour
