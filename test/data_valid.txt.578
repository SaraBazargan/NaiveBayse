today was the type of day that has often seemed reserved for professional basketball franchises outside new jersey it was a day when everything from doctors reports to jump shots fell favorably for the nets it began with jayson williams receiving clearance to compete in full contact practices as soon as thursday and it ended with the nets walloping the powerful portland trail blazers the league 's second best team by the almost inconceivable score of 115 103 fresh off their five game western conference trip the nets blitzed one of the league 's elite defensive clubs for more points than any other opponent this season a full 25 above portland 's average allowed and in a game they led by as many as 26 points the nets became just the fifth team to defeat the blazers 46 14 by a double figure margin this shows everybody that we 're legit and that on any given night we can be the best team in the league or we can be the worst team in the league said kendall gill one of five nets players to score in double digits with 14 points the trick for us is to stay at a consistent level this was a totally legitimate win they had all of their people and we went in there and did what we had to do the shocking performance continued a stretch of basketball that can safely be called the nets best of the season in winning 6 of their last 11 games the nets have defeated playoff bound miami minnesota charlotte and now portland they lost close games to the stalwarts utah and san antonio and in what can only be a great sign for coach don casey 's club the nets 25 36 play 8 of their next 12 games at continental arena where they have won 5 of their last 6 contests and are 18 12 over all on friday the nets visit milwaukee which at 29 32 is tied with orlando for the eastern conference 's eighth and final playoff spot it is one of three meetings the clubs have remaining this season with the way these guys play in their hearts and their minds we have as good a chance as anyone casey said referring to his team 's shot at qualifying for the postseason it 's just that we 're paying for past sins so we 're trying to create a better spiritual atmosphere so those sins will go away williams 's return would certainly generate enthusiasm even though it will be a while before he can make key contributions after undergoing a series of strength tests the charismatic center who has been sidelined since breaking his right leg last april 1 was cleared to practice just hours before tonight 's tip off it 's good to be back and to earn my money said williams who also underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee sept 14 and it 's exciting because i really do n't know how i 'm going to play i 'm waiting to see it 's like playing poker a quirk in the nets schedule gives them five days off between home games on march 12 and march 18 so williams is hoping to get in enough practices to be ready for the march 18 game against milwaukee he said stipulations in the nets insurance policy will limit him to a maximum of eight minutes of play in each of the first six games while williams is already envisioning himself in the nets rotation michael rowe the team 's president said the club had no timetable for his return to game play our coaches will evaluate his competitiveness over the next six or seven practices rowe said then he 'll have another examination to make sure there 's no swelling or pain and a decision in consultation with our doctors will be made with williams on the bench in a suit stephon marbury led the nets with a near triple double performance of 24 points 13 assists and 7 rebounds after scoring more than 30 points in five of the past nine games he began the contest by passing almost exclusively with his teammates shooting well marbury tallied 8 assists in the first 12 minutes kerry kittles was brilliant in starting the nets off hot making three of four 3 point attempts in scoring 13 of his 15 points in the first seven minutes behind him the nets took a 30 25 lead after one quarter and rolled from there things went so swimmingly for the nets who led by 61 47 at halftime and by 94 70 after three quarters that jamie feick their brutish rebounder attempted a couple of 3 pointers with the game well in hand the 6 foot 8 inch center canned his first 3 pointer since joining the nets last march with 1 minute 44 seconds left the basket which gave the nets a 112 93 lead felt good to feick so he drilled another one on the nets next possession to add a season high tying 16 points to his 8 rebounds come on with the 3 point jokes said feick who now has 11 career 3 pointers i used to shoot the three in high school and at michigan state i shot it in the nba too look at the stats it 's not in the game plan here though
