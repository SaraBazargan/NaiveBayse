the united states should take the next step to resolve the dispute over chinese exports of missile technology a senior chinese foreign policy official said today in remarks that suggested a continuing impasse over one of the most sensitive issues in chinese american relations we think the ball is in your court the official said of the festering discord over chinese transfers of missile parts and know how to countries that include pakistan and iran the senior official who was involved in last week 's meetings here with president bush called in several american reporters today for a briefing with the condition that he not be identified his remarks helped explain why a long sought final accord on curbing missile proliferation remained elusive last week the official declined to specify what china expected the united states to do before china followed through with promises it made in november 2000 to issue detailed regulations on sensitive exports but in the inconclusive negotiations over the last year china has insisted that the united states first proceed with its own pledge to authorize chinese commercial launching of american satellites officials here also demand that the united states end punitive measures against a chinese arms company that china says were unfairly applied the united states says it will not relax the ban on commercial satellite launching a potentially lucrative and prestigious business for china until china fulfills the november 2000 agreement chinese launching of american satellites was suspended during the clinton administration because of concerns about the transfer of technological secrets mr bush would find it politically difficult to allow resumption of that business without strong new anti proliferation measures from china in the accord in november 2000 china pledged to end exports of ballistic missiles and technologies it agreed to issue export control rules and a list of sensitive dual use items that could help the government rein in its increasingly free wheeling arms companies to american chagrin the rules and list have still not been issued in an effort to end the deadlock china 's top arms control negotiator will travel to washington in march for talks the official said today the official said that despite disagreement over missiles taiwan and human rights mr bush 's two day visit was constructive positive and fruitful he said china was pleased that vice president hu jintao who is expected to take over as communist party leader and president would visit the united states for the first time in late april and that president jiang zemin would visit in october but the official also cautioned that tensions over taiwan would rise if the united states did not temper its arms sales to the island which china considers a renegade part of the motherland today the foreign ministry spokesman kong quan warned in a news conference that taiwan authorities would eat their own bitter fruit if they continued with what he called a push toward incremental independence china has been angered by proposals in taipei to start using the word taiwan in the official name of its de facto embassies overseas and by the reported intention of taiwan 's defense minister to attend a private military conference in florida next month china says such a visit would breach the american commitment to shun official contacts with taiwan the bush administration has not announced whether it will grant a visa the senior chinese official elaborating on the stalled missile accord insisted that china is not placing conditions on its pledge to fight the spread of weapons of mass destruction we will honor our part and you should honor your part he said of the 2000 accord the official said china shared the american interest in curbing proliferation of weapons and would act against any company found engaging in questionable sales one sticking point is the sanctions applied last year by washington against a chinese arms company that reportedly sold sensitive missile parts to pakistan china 's longtime ally china says the sales were not dangerous and were arranged before november 2000 and not covered by the accord american officials say they had a verbal understanding that china 's new prohibitions would apply to pre existing technology sales the chinese official today denied making any commitment to grandfathering the accord that agreement was for the future and now the united states is saying it was for the past he said but this does not imply that any prior deals posed a risk of weapons proliferation he added
