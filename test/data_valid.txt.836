sipping a glass of pinot meunier in a local winery christopher newton reminisced about his first few seasons as artistic director of the shaw festival audiences walked out of his 1980 production of the philanderer and his 1981 plan to stage st joan without its epilogue failed when the society of authors threatened to withhold the rights to the play one critic suggested that mr newton be fired or that the shaw festival change its name twenty one years after he was hired mr newton 64 still holds the job and the shaw festival is one of the largest theater events in north america attracting nearly 350000 people a year to this old fashioned village 8 miles downstream from niagara falls and 35 miles north of buffalo the 11 play festival opened in april and ends on dec 10 more than a third of the audience comes from the united states festival memberships which include advance purchase privileges have nearly doubled to 9000 in the last five years mr newton a native of kent england who has been awarded the order of canada the country 's highest honor is credited with keeping together a strong ensemble of actors and fostering a very striking very intelligent visual and aural style of production in the words of robert cushman theater critic for the national post with just three seasons left until his retirement in 2002 mr newton is leading the festival through a major expansion of its mandate since its inception in 1962 the festival has focused on plays written during shaw 's lifetime 1856 to 1950 which meant wilde coward ibsen and chekhov and musical greats like the gershwin brothers and cole porter this season however he opened the festival to more modern plays nigel williams 's adaption of william goldings 1955 novel lord of the flies opens july 5 and joe masteroff 's musical she loves me is running through the festival 's last day you have to rethink yourself and reinvent yourself all the time mr newton said adding this seemed a good opportunity with shaw coming out of copyright the festival has paid 168000 to 335000 a year in copyright fees to shaw 's estate since the copyright expires 50 years after shaw 's death the festival can use that money to commission new works and to buy rights to more recent plays mr newton directed three plays this season though only one is a product of the new mandate shaw 's exploration of medical ethics the doctors dilemma has had three previous stagings at the festival and noel coward 's easy virtue was repeated from last year the matchmaker by thornton wilder set in 1880 's yonkers was written in 1954 four years after shaw 's death the remainder of the playbill is vintage festival material shaw 's political satire the apple cart wilde 's melodrama a woman of no importance coward 's still life j b priestley 's family drama time and the conways and luigi pirandello 's six characters in search of an author we are not terribly experimental mr newton said we never will be because our audience is n't most of the plays they 've never heard of they 've never seen they 've got to trust that there will be good acting and that it will be done sensibly like a sommelier bringing obscure vintages from the cellar however mr newton ventures beyond classics and crowd pleasers where are you going to see 'ivona princess of burgundia except here and where are you going to see any plays by henry arthur jones he asked you 're blowing the dust off things and in any major cultural center that 's what you spend a lot of time doing years ago i must admit i could n't quite see what the relevance was of the shaw festival then when i got here the point suddenly became a lot clearer to me shaw 's lifetime has given us all insights and clues into how we live today
