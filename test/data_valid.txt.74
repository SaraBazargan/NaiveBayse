to the editor in her review of nina bernstein 's book the lost children of wilder the epic struggle to change foster care march 25 tanya luhrmann says the wilders story provides a vivid argument against president bush 's plan to enlist religious organizations in providing social services to the needy there is always the danger she writes that the religious organizations will favor their own or impose their own moral views on their clients the wilders story was not about private proselytism with federal and state funds it was about the inability of new york city to place children black or white exhibiting sociopathic behavior in any private foster care agency religious or nonsectarian or in a private family home on a long term basis right or wrong like shirley wilder such children went to homes run by the state and frequently ended up in spofford juvenile center in the south bronx there was no other alternative then and there is no other alternative now the conclusion to be drawn from the facts of the wilders story is not that it is a danger for private agencies to be the vehicle for social services but that the in loco parentis function must be and can only be successfully provided by such agencies or individual families because government has proved itself utterly incapable of performing this function at even a minimally acceptable level thornton g sanders charlottesville va
