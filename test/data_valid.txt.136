the weeks after mexico 's presidential voting have always been a time for hand kissing when supplicants of all stripes used any opportunity to express rapturous supine loyalty to the latest president elect vicente fox has turned the traditional rituals upside down using the weeks since his victory in july 2 balloting to visit his vanquished rivals one by one to apologize for his slashing attacks on them during the campaign for mexicans there is plenty of charm in what is a display of humility perhaps as stunning as mr fox 's election itself in the month since he won the election mr fox has outlined a hugely ambitious program of reforms aimed at modernizing mexico after a century of one party rule if he wants as promised to bring change he needs to broaden support in neither house of congress does his center right party enjoy a majority so even as he has been working to solidify the eclectic left right coalition that helped him to victory he has been mending fences with the forces he vanquished on friday evening he met francisco labastida ochoa the defeated governing party candidate whom he ridiculed as an errand boy before the vote we told mr labastida of our intention to lodge an apology for the harsh campaign mr fox said in a statement to foreign eyes this might seem like simple good sportsmanship but in a country where presidents have enjoyed kinglike powers and often acted with regal arrogance mr fox 's magnanimous bearing has seemed a remarkable shift our presidents have been as infallible as the pope said jorge chabat a professor at the center for investigation and teaching in mexico city so it startles us to see fox express his apologies he 's inviting us to see that our rulers are made of flesh and blood and this is unprecedented mr fox 's behavior has broken with his predecessors patterns in other ways presidents elect from the governing institutional revolutionary party which won every election from 1929 until mr fox 's stunning upset tended to keep their policy plans vague until they took office their transition teams worked in secret and in public appearances they maintained an aloof solemnity and spoke in opaque terms that often left mexicans puzzling over what the new ruler was thinking mr fox in contrast has appointed a sprawling transition team with dozens of experts studying everything from tax rates to police training to foreign policy and their work is unfolding under the glare of tumultuous media coverage mr fox has spoken bluntly in interviews with television newscasters radio hosts or newspaper reporters virtually every day since his election there 's one thing i think he talks too much said hector aguilar camin a novelist who is host on a weekly political round table discussion on televisa the largest network the risk is that everybody is going to get tired of him but it 's great that he 's put his agenda out in the open and i 'd bet he has more support now than when he won the election a month ago he 's performed very skillfully mr fox does not take office until dec 1 but the next political cycle will get under way with the first session of the new congress on sept 1 mr fox 's national action party will have 208 seats in the 500 member chamber of deputies that means he will need to attract 43 votes to reach the 251 vote majority needed to pass legislation the former governing party will have 209 seats and the main leftist party 53 in the 128 seat senate mr fox 's party will have 46 seats the pri 60 the leftist party 15 and small parties the rest it will take skillful negotiating to gain approval for even a part of the new president 's sweeping plans for remaking mexico he hopes to open up both the electric power and petrochemical industries to private investment plans that infuriate powerful unions he wants to abolish several cabinet ministries including the attorney general 's office replacing that with a united states style department of justice that would require several constitutional amendments as would a proposal floated last week to remove the prohibition on the re election of lawmakers and city mayors a legacy of the 1917 revolution whose war cry was effective suffrage no re election he has promised to overhaul the educational system and to provide huge new credits to small businesses those and other promises will require hefty new tax revenues and when his economic advisers last month offered their first suggestion for how to raise them proposing to eliminate sales tax exemptions for medicines and most groceries there was an outpouring of criticism on radio and television talk shows mr fox quickly retreated and mexicans realized they had witnessed the deft use of an american style political tactic the trial balloon this is night and day from the way politics were handled in the past said denise dresser a political scientist at the autonomous technological institute in mexico city issues like taxes were discussed behind closed doors by insiders and then imposed on the public fox is showing a willingness to test citizen reaction to initiatives and change them when there 's resistance we 're seeing the end of the imperial presidency but mr fox still must persuade mexicans to accept higher taxes and his evolving plans for fiscal reform are likely to be the focus of the most intense debates of his first months in office rogelio ramirez de la o an influential mexico city economic consultant argued in a report last week that mr fox would face a cash flow squeeze far more severe than previously acknowledged because president ernesto zedillo 's economic advisers have understated the financial burden they are leaving behind as a legacy of a bank rescue from 1995 to 1997 which has so far cost taxpayers 100 billion we anticipate a period of hard learning for the new government mr ramirez wrote they will soon find out the need for extra revenue is heavily underestimated but mr fox 's recent attempts to make peace with his adversaries suggest that he understands the difficulties ahead one of the first came on july 26 when he visited cuauhtemoc cardenas solorzano the defeated leftist candidate to present our apologies as mr fox put it later for calling mr cardenas a traitor to the fight for democracy during the campaign on wednesday at a ceremony in which an electoral tribunal formally certified mr fox 's victory he asked the magistrates to forgive him for another harsh campaign utterance in january when the tribunal had ruled against him in a campaign dispute mr fox had called the tribunal 's legal arguments the grunting of swine i had chalked up that insult to campaign passions jose luis de la peza the tribunal president said on thursday obviously it was an act of considerable nobility for him to offer an apology in the same speech to the tribunal mr fox also sought conciliation with gay mexicans whom he had offended with several homophobic campaign remarks let 's build a free and generous mexico where nobody is persecuted for their political or religious beliefs life styles or sexual preferences mr fox said
