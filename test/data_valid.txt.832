with the five year statute of limitations about to run out on some counts a federal grand jury has returned indictments against 13 saudis and one lebanese in the 1996 terrorist truck bombing that killed 19 american airmen and injured nearly 400 others at the khobar towers residential complex in saudi arabia although not all the suspects are in custody in saudi arabia and none are yet in the united states a measure of judicial accountability now seems likely for this crime no iranians have yet been formally charged even though the grand jury found that those who carried out the attack were inspired supported and directed by elements of the iranian government attorney general john ashcroft said that not enough hard evidence had yet been assembled to prevail in court he should press forward there is no statute of limitations on murder although bringing charges against past or present tehran officials is sure to irritate iran 's reform minded elected leaders there can be no diplomatic justification for not pursuing iranian suspects limited cooperation from the saudis hampered the investigation americans were allowed to observe saudi interrogations of key suspects but could not directly participate understandably the saudis preferred to curb the foreign and domestic political ramifications of the case they feared that if american investigators proved an iranian connection tehran might retaliate against saudi arabia yet as the main beneficiaries of the american military protection the airmen were there to provide saudi authorities should have been braver and more helpful the indicted saudis are said to belong to an organization called saudi hezbollah believed to be sponsored and aided by iranian intelligence agencies the elements of iran 's government linked to terrorism are those controlled by its conservative religious leadership under tehran 's supreme leader the ayatollah ali khamenei not by the elected government of president mohammad khatami iranian politics are now delicately balanced between mr khatami 's reformers and his clerical rivals and indictments could provoke an anti american backlash yet better relations between the united states and iran can not be built on excusing acts of terrorism against american servicemen if a provable case can be assembled against iranian intelligence officials in the khobar bombing washington should seek further indictments
