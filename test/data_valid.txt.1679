in today 's cynical world where things seldom justify their hype we 're happy to report the following harry potter and the order of the phoenix rocks j k rowling has really outdone herself harry ron and hermione are in fine form and the plot has plenty of surprises the whole voldemort has weapons of mass destruction subplot for example touching and timely and who would 've expected an overview of the conceptual art of yoko ono right there in chapter 19 i mean it 's ms rowling 's book she can write what she wants but that 's one development we did not see coming we 'll have to reread goblet of fire to make sure of course with two pottermaniacs as devoted as we are chances were good we would like phoenix no matter what how devoted are we how many people actually quit their jobs so they will have more time to read it the guy at the unemployment office said i admire what you two are doing he did n't have to say that all summer with nothing to do but read book five who 's laughing now suckers by suckers we mean our parents our wives the mortgage company and so forth many people scoffed at our months long preparation for the release of phoenix new glasses ok the judge said building a special 'potterbunker with six months of provisions and a chemical toilet fine it 's your money but quitting work severing contact with your families is n't that a little excessive i guess making little wizard hats for the cats to wear is 'excessive too we told him defiantly i suppose crashing a golf cart into the bookstore window creating a diversion that would ensure we got the first copies is 'excessive if that 's 'excessive we do n't want to be 'cessive your honor you have to understand the kind of pressure we were under we had been jumpy for weeks knowing that the books were in warehouses nearby yet we could n't get at them copies were under armed guard and the buildup was relentless you could n't escape it the conflict between harry and voldemort is too sweeping too elemental too lucrative to be contained in mere books it has spawned everything from movies to toothpaste in this environment it was only a matter of time before we snapped besides if you publish a book 870 pages long you have to expect that sooner or later someone 's going to use it as a weapon but now we have phoenix and all 's right with the world granted our impressions of it are a bit hazy between rereading the first four books getting in line early wednesday then deciding instead to do the thing with the golf cart running from the mob being trapped in the burning windmill the cops the arraignment what we 're trying to say is we have n't slept in 168 hours so you 'd better read it for yourself while we 're waiting to be sentenced we 'd like to thank j k rowling for bringing so much excitement into our lives thank you ms rowling and thank you harry we 'll be reading and enjoying order of the phoenix for many years to come most likely three to five years according to our lawyer op ed contributors michael gerber author of barry trotter and the unauthorized parody and jonathan schwarz contribute humor to many publications
