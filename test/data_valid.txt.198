quarterback chad pennington the linchpin of the jets offense since he took over the starting job after four games last season fractured and dislocated his left wrist in tonight 's 15 14 victory against the giants and had surgery at lenox hill hospital the injury is to pennington 's nonthrowing hand and the jets did not initially announce how long he would be out but he will definitely miss the season opener in 12 days against washington and perhaps much longer standard guidelines call for an injury like this to take six to eight weeks to heal but that is for a nonathlete because the injury is not to pennington 's throwing hand it seems unlikely that it would end his season the jets now turn to vinny testaverde 39 who lost the starting job to pennington after the jets began last season 1 3 testaverde completed 54 of 83 passes last year for 499 yards with 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions and he struggled in the west coast offense in which pennington ultimately thrived until tonight testaverde had played in just one drive of the preseason but he took over when pennington was hurt and played almost the entire third quarter against the giants he finished 5 of 11 for 48 yards pennington 's injury is the most significant the jets have had since testaverde then the starter tore his left achilles tendon in the 1999 season opener pennington 's injury delivers a significant jolt to the jets hopes to reach the playoffs for a third straight season this is the second serious injury to one of the league 's young star quarterbacks in two weeks atlanta 's michael vick broke his fibula last week and is out at least six weeks when i heard about it it gave me flashbacks to 1999 when i was injured and we were looking forward to a great year testaverde said i feel like i 'm ready mentally i 'm always preparing as if i 'm the starter because you never know when you 'll be called upon it 's unfortunate that it 's come sooner rather than later i think we 're going to have a great season everybody has to pick it up a little bit as i told ray lucas when i first got here if you hang around long enough you get an opportunity i 'm getting a second chance complicating the situation is a left knee sprain that the third string quarterback brooks bollinger sustained late in the game the severity of his injury is not yet known but coach herman edwards said the jets would probably look to sign a veteran quarterback as insurance all of our hearts stopped running back curtis martin said of pennington 's injury chad 's an integral part of this team for him to go down scared everyone pennington was hurt late in the second quarter when he was scrambling to his right under pressure he attempted a pass which was incomplete and he was dragged down from behind by linebacker brandon short who came up on a blitz pennington 's left hand hit the ground hard and then his arm bent behind him as he fell he used his right arm to break his fall but when he got up pennington was grabbing his left wrist he hunched over in what appeared to be significant pain and when doctors came onto the field to look at him he went down on one knee he gripped his wrist in a towel as he was taken off the field for x rays pennington had completed 4 of 12 passes for 58 yards when he left the game edwards who was visibly down after the game told players not to discuss the injury but he said that when pennington came to the sideline it was clear the injury was bad i could n't look in his face edwards said it was too hard for me at that point pennington had not sustained an injury since he became the starter in the fourth game last season and his only significant injury had been to a knee in the preseason of his rookie year with play so good that he drew comparisons to joe montana pennington led the jets surge into the second round of the playoffs last season pennington had a quarterback rating of 1042 after completing a remarkable 689 percent of his passes for 22 touchdowns and only 6 interceptions chad is our leader safety sam garnes said but we have a great player in vinny and we have the utmost confidence in him we know he 'll get the job done and we hope the best for chad the jets offense had looked particularly good in the preseason with pennington establishing a rhythm with the new receiver curtis conway and the third receiver santana moss but tonight the jets starters were dismal on both sides of the ball the offense was halted on its first three drives and the starting defense gave up a 21 play 95 yard touchdown drive that gave the giants a 7 0 lead the next time the giants had the ball ike hilliard caught a quick slant pass between nickel back ray mickens and safety tyrone carter and ran for an 88 yard touchdown to make it 14 0 on testaverde 's first full drive in the third quarter the jets drove 53 yards to the giants 3 yard line before stalling doug brien kicked a 21 yard field goal to make the score 14 6 the jets backups rallied for two scores in the fourth quarter it 's really unfortunate because we as players do n't want to see anyone get hurt giants defensive end michael strahan said of pennington 's injury for him to get hurt like that in a preseason game is just a shame i hope he has a speedy recovery because i know the team is depending on him and all the jets fans are depending on him after a remarkably injury free training camp the jets now have injury questions on both sides of the ball defensive end john abraham left early in the first quarter tonight with back spasms he did not return to the sideline and his status was not known
