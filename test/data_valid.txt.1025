to the editor regarding the july 2 review of the the fish cellar where i am chef a review should coincide with the rating m h reed found one dish bland using the words hospital kitchen to describe it and then gave us a very good rating overall that does not equate words should be chosen carefully if not the review will confuse readers should we try this restaurant i do n't know it got a 'very good but it also mentioned something about hospital food hospital kitchen is not part of my vocabulary you can critique my food but not degrade my work joseph sasso mount kisco
