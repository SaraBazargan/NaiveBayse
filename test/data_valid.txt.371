yasir arafat has a long and frustrating history of fudging or postponing hard decisions now he can postpone no more last weekend 's deadly terrorist attacks in jerusalem and haifa by hamas suicide bombers have all but shattered his credibility as a negotiating partner important israeli political leaders are ready to write him off and wait however long it takes for a more politically courageous and decisive palestinian leader to emerge their impatience is readily understandable mr arafat 's reluctance to shut down terrorist groups like hamas has again led to the death of innocent teenagers and adults and thrown yet another set of israeli families into mourning still israel should not take this decisive step just yet although mr arafat 's latest pledges of a thoroughgoing crackdown on terror seem familiar and unconvincing to most israelis they ought to be tested over the next few days once before in 1996 he did act decisively and effectively to break up networks of radical suicide bombers he needs to launch an equally tough campaign now that will require shaping up his formidable police and security forces and decisively throwing them into the battle against terror palestinian police should be used to break up all known terrorist cells of hamas islamic jihad and secular radical groups leaders and members of these organizations connected to planning abetting or carrying out acts of violence should be severely prosecuted the thousands of illegally held weapons now dispersed among the palestinian population must be either surrendered to the palestinian authority or forcibly seized incitements to violence should be ended whatever their source if mr arafat actually carries out such a rigorous antiterror campaign it would be in israel 's own interests to re engage him as a peace negotiator to do so effectively israelis will need to move beyond this week 's retaliatory actions and consider steps they might take to lessen the anger among nonviolent palestinian civilians these might begin with freezing expansion of jewish settlements in the west bank and gaza strip and when security conditions permit easing the economic blockades surrounding palestinian towns such gestures would lessen any palestinian political backlash against a roundup of terrorists and would increase diplomatic pressure on mr arafat to offer compromises of his own for all his many flaws mr arafat is still the only palestinian political leader with enough authority to sell a territorial compromise to his own people provided he chooses to do so he is also the only palestinian figure with a strong enough police force to bring greater security to israel again provided he chooses that path those are precisely the choices that mr arafat has deliberately avoided making for years explaining away his failures by his desire to maintain palestinian unity and avoid a showdown with groups like hamas that reject any negotiated peace with israel his equivocations have deeply undermined his reputation among israelis to some extent their consequences have cost him support among palestinians as well since signing the first oslo peace agreement with yitzhak rabin eight years ago mr arafat has failed to deliver the kind of security israel requires and the kind of economic and political gains palestinians legitimately expect the administration he has built in areas under his control has been prone to cronyism corruption and dictatorial rule more democracy and economic freedom and less indulgence of terrorism would better serve the palestinian people time is rapidly running out on mr arafat he must decide now whether he is a leader who can and will complete the ambitious peace effort he began in 1993 if he can not it is hard to see how he has any meaningful role left to play
