if president bush wants to get a better handle on the problems he 's facing in iraq and the west bank i suggest he study the speech made oct 16 by malaysia 's departing prime minister mahathir mohamad to a conclave of muslim leaders most of that speech was a brutally frank look into the causes of the muslim world 's decline though it was also laced with shameful anti jewish slurs it was still revealing five times he referred to muslims as humiliated if i 've learned one thing covering world affairs it 's this the single most underappreciated force in international relations is humiliation i will not enumerate the instances of our humiliation mr mahathir said we are all muslims we are all oppressed we are all being humiliated today we the whole muslim community are treated with contempt and dishonor there is a feeling of hopelessness among the muslim countries and their people they feel that they can do nothing right he added our only reaction is to become more and more angry angry people can not think properly one reason yasir arafat rejected the clinton plan for a palestinian state was that he and many followers did n't want a state handed to them by the us or israel that would be humiliating they wanted to win it in blood and fire hezbollah tv had bombarded palestinians with stories of how the lebanese drove the israelis out palestinian militants wanted the dignity of doing the same always remember the arab israeli conflict is about both borders and nobel prizes it 's about where the dividing line should be and it 's about the humiliation that comes from one side succeeding at modernity and the other not as mr mahathir says in his speech we sacrifice lives unnecessarily achieving nothing other than to attract more massive retaliation and humiliation but we are up against a people who think the jews survived 2000 years of pogroms not by hitting back but by thinking we can not fight them through brawn alone we must use our brains also which is why the palestinians need both their own state and a new leadership able to build their dignity on achievements not resistance ditto iraq why have the us forces never gotten the ovation they expected for liberating iraq from saddam 's tyranny in part it is because many iraqis feel humiliated that they did n't liberate themselves and america 's presence even its aid reminds them of that add the daily slights and miscommunications that come with any occupation and even the best intended liberators will wear out their welcome over time i was with my iraqi translator one day in baghdad trying to enter the office of the governing council the american private security guard at the door ordered me to shut my mouth until i was told to speak then he told my translator to sit in the 130 degree heat while he escorted me the american inside to see if the iraqi leader we were seeing was available both of us felt like punching that guard in the face iraq is full of angry men mustafa alrawi managing editor of iraq today wrote in beirut 's daily star for example in the area unfairly labeled as the 'sunni triangle the population was badly hurt by the decision to disband the army and the policy of de baathification thousands of men many of whom took pride in their rank and status were left bewildered and confused it must be remembered that the army did not fight the us invasion effectively giving their stamp of approval to the plan to topple saddam hussein they have wounded pride to restore entire tribes feel embarrassed that they supported the invasion only to be left out in the cold by the coalition 's myopic vision of how iraq should be run never ever underestimate a people 's pride no matter how broken they might be it is very easy for iraqis to hate saddam and resent america for overstaying tap into people 's dignity and they will do anything for you ignore it and they wo n't lift a finger which is why a pakistani friend tells me that what the us needs most in iraq is a strategy of dehumiliation and re dignification the only way we 'll foster a decent government in iraq is if every day we turn a little more power over to iraqis and create the economic conditions where iraqis can be successful the more we empower iraqis the less humiliated they will feel the more time we will have to help them and the less they will need our help
