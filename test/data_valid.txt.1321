sporting less muscle and hardly any beads venus williams returned to the scene of one of her most important victories today and made it clear that despite her father richard 's suggestions to the contrary she always intended to return to the game no no she said about retirement i would have been back a lot sooner if it was n't for the tendinitis in my wrists it just took a long time to heal i used to have tendinitis in my knee i could play with that it was different but you ca n't do it without your hands citing sore wrists williams missed the first four months of this season withdrawing from five tournaments including the year 's first grand slam event the australian open during her layoff she said she followed the game on television and the internet and took a course in fashion illustration i like playing tennis more she said studying is a real job she returned to competition two weeks ago in hamburg germany beating irina spirlea in three often unsightly sets and then losing in straight sets to amanda coetzer a player she once dominated consistently but today on the same court where she won the last italian open title she bore a closer resemblance to the power player her opponents remember against coetzer in hamburg she had made unforced errors in bunches and often looked off balance in today 's 6 1 6 2 victory over chanda rubin she covered court very well kept her aggressive groundstrokes more consistently in play and finished off the inconsistent rubin with her fifth ace of the match five more than she hit against coetzer i 'm really starting to play better now said williams who spent the last nine days training in rome starting last week in hamburg i was a little iffy it was just tough i was not practicing very much and i just had to learn a tough lesson this has been the most trying period yet in the 19 year old williams 's short but compelling career in an interview after the match conducted with her tiny yorkshire terrier pete sitting comfortably on her lap williams said she had first felt a twinge in her left wrist here while warming up on center court for a match in rome last year i did n't pay much attention to it she said you use your whole body sometimes you feel different things but they go away but i can tell you that i sure did n't know it was going to come out like this williams a right hander with a two handed backhand taped her wrist for matches occasionally throughout the summer reaching the quarterfinals at wimbledon and the semifinals at the united states open where her younger sister serena won the singles title the wrist just got steadily worse over the season said their mother and co coach oracene venus was playing hurt and not telling anyone but venus said that it was only after reaching the chase semifinals that the pain became too intense for her to practice or play in december i was home really training and trying hard to get ready for the australian open and i just could n't do it she said between january and april i would say i had a total of maybe three weeks of practice at the most i could have gone to tournaments but i just do n't know how good it would have been to take the risk of losing matches because i was a little bit injured or having to retire from matches i just thought it would be wiser to stay home until it was healed venus whose two handed backhand is her best shot even experimented with switching to a one handed backhand in an attempt to accelerate her comeback she was hitting one handed with slice oracene said and we just told her 'venus that 's not your game all it did was end up hurting my right wrist williams said but i 'm better now venus said she tried a variety of treatments including acupuncture but the only remedy that really helped was time i missed tennis but i had a lot to do she said every day was packed and it was like i was the one at home so i did everything i became the businesswomen i did things for serena things for my mom things for my dad things for myself everyone 's affairs i handled in march during the ericsson open her father said that he believed it was very likely that venus would retire venus was shocked when she heard it oracene said of her husband 's comments so what can i say venus said today i was just an innocent bystander i was just watching the story too though venus declared herself pain free she played today with her left wrist taped which she had not done in hamburg it 's fine she said i 'm feeling real good if it was n't good i would just be shipped home it 's not holding me back from my regular shots for the moment she is not hitting her first serve as consistently hard as before her layoff she has clearly lost muscle definition if not weight in her legs and arms my dad he wanted me to do a lot of fitness work she said but i usually found a way to get out of it asked whether she might not feel she had maximized her talent until she too had won a grand slam singles title she said there 's no one out here who does n't want to win a slam i know i have the capability we 'll see if i can barring a relapse she will get her next opportunity at the french open which begins on may 29 serena who has struggled with her game of late is currently in florida because of a sore knee and is spending her time moving into her and venus 's recently completed new home but oracene and venus both expect serena to play at roland garros the other contenders are well aware that unlike most of them the sisters do not necessarily need many matches to reach cruising speed
