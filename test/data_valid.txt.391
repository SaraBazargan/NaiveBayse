to the editor re the declining support for executions by andrew kohut op ed may 10 i find it encouraging that the trend in public opinion is for doing away with the death penalty mr kohut notes that while the public still considers deterrence the primary justification for the death penalty a recent poll found that the majority did not believe that the death penalty lowered the murder rate indeed studies in criminal justice and sociology show that the death penalty does not have a deterrent effect if the death penalty does not deter criminals there is no other rationale for it other than retribution revenge and vengeance do we really want a society that abides by the philosophy of eye for an eye steven j campbell columbia sc may 10 2001
