the knicks summer long pursuit of boston 's danny fortson is apparently over fortson was the centerpiece of a four team deal yesterday that will send the bruising power forward to the golden state warriors according to a western conference official who spoke on the condition of anonymity the warriors will receive fortson and utah 's adam keefe while the celtics will receive the dallas point guard robert pack and a no 1 draft pick from the jazz in return utah will receive golden state forward donyell marshall the mavericks may have ended up with the best bargain of all in the four team swap dallas secured the rights to utah point guard howard eisley john stockton 's primary backup the last few seasons the deal allowed dallas to sign eisley a free agent to a multiyear deal so the mavericks did not risk eventually losing eisley if he had signed for dallas 's 225 million exception as of yesterday afternoon salary cap issues still had to be worked out to complete the trade but the official said the deal was imminent fortson was set to sign with the knicks for the club 's 225 million exception if the deal fell through the knicks were hoping to procure the frontcourt services of fortson for their rebounder poor team a multipurpose post player he could have come off the bench and relieved patrick ewing or larry johnson but the four team deal kills that possibility
