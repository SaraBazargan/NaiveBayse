when 330 pound shaquille o'neal held 21 year old kobe bryant in his massive arms last june after the los angeles lakers won their first championship in 12 years the photograph said it all after four seasons of frustration the national basketball association 's brightest young stars had finally bottled their galactic potential seven months and 35 games after the lakers eliminated the indiana pacers and the staples center was engulfed in the roar of the sellout crowd and purple and gold confetti o'neal and bryant are openly colliding and threatening to combust one of the nba 's most marketable commodities and if coach phil jackson can not rectify the rift another supernova tandem seems destined for a crash and burn ending the division between the two all stars deepens each day when people said this was my team we went 67 15 and we won the whole thing o'neal said yesterday in a telephone interview now before the all star break we 've got 23 wins 11 losses we 're playing with no passion no enthusiasm and no hunger you 're right it 's not my team after the lakers practiced yesterday in el segundo calif bryant fired his own shot across the bow asked to interpret o'neal comments he replied all we ask from shaq is to be the dominant presence that he is and play solid defense that 's it scoring should n't affect his defense for more than four seasons o'neal and bryant have overcome friction egos a slap fight in practice and incredible expectations to lead the lakers to a title but never has the tension been so palpable as it has the past few days with neither bryant nor o'neal offering genuine conciliatory remarks to patch up their relationship the latest rift erupted days after the lakers fell to 23 11 after an embarrassing blowout loss to the clippers in an espn magazine article this week bryant disclosed a conversation he had with jackson a week into the season in which jackson asked bryant to assume last season 's role of letting the offense flow through o'neal and taking over only when necessary bryant 's response tone my game down i need to turn it up i 've improved how are you going to bottle me up i 'd be better off playing somewhere else bryant played down the veiled threat of a trade demand on tuesday saying he wanted to remain a laker for life and that he and o'neal would work out their differences just as they have in the past but neither bryant nor o'neal the league 's most valuable player last season has since given any quarter in the controversy the rift stems from bryant 's increased role in the offense averaging a career high 296 points and 46 assists a game and leading the nba in scoring he has taken 171 more shots this season than o'neal who has missed two games o'neal is averaging 258 points a game on nearly 56 percent shooting 4 points less than last season he is also shooting a career low 391 percent from the free throw line making only 148 of 379 foul shots o'neal is bothered that the lakers do n't begin many of their offensive plays by first going inside to him a strategy that led to many easy baskets for teammates during last season 's title run when you feed the big dog the dog will be happy o'neal said on tuesday i 'm not luc longley i 'm not dikembe mutombo i ca n't run 13 minutes in a game without touching the ball i 'm not used to that i was n't brought here to rebound and do that stuff jerry west brought me in here because he wanted me to play i can put numbers on the board i can do what i do it 's not about points we 're not an outside team we 're an inside out team bryant was asked yesterday if the lakers could win a title if his offensive role were increased and o'neal 's decreased oh absolutely because we 've been losing games on our defensive end he said offensively there 's nothing wrong with us we 're like 1 or 2 in the league in offense defense is what 's killing us and i think were just going to improve as a ball club in that department jackson is expected to meet with the two players over the next few days and try to iron out the situation before it become more volatile as with many frustrated young players a few more victories could cure what ails o'neal and bryant but the worst case is not pretty in 1996 o'neal left orlando after having a fallout with magic management and failing to co exist with the all star guard penny hardaway presumed to be a dominant tandem into the millennium the shaq penny breakup was one of several highly publicized partings between nba superstars over the last few years whether it was money ego or simply better opportunity duos such as kevin garnett stephon marbury allen iverson jerry stackhouse and shawn kemp gary payton did not have the longevity of tandems like michael jordan scottie pippen john stockton karl malone magic johnson kareem abdul jabbar and walt frazier willis reed o'neal is signed for the next seven years while bryant still has four more years remaining on his contract mitch kupchak the lakers general manager has been clear that he has no intention of moving either player calling the notion ridiculous but if wounded prides are not soothed soon the greatest 1 2 punch in the game today is in danger of eventually splitting up kobe knew how we played last year jackson said shaq 's not going to change he 's going to play the same game he 's not going to bring he ball down the court and pull up for a 3 point shot he has n't yet when that happens then i 'll have a talk with him bryant was asked if he regretted his comments in the espn magazine which included yes i trust my teammates i just trust myself more no because it was just the truth he said i do n't regret being honest of his relationship with o'neal bryant said we throw punches every day we body slam each other every day no my relationship with shaq is just fine obviously we go our separate ways but we 're cool i support him he supports me we get the job done and that 's it asked about bryant 's comment that he needed to turn his game up o'neal replied i do n't get involved with what guys want to do individually but i 've always wanted to be a team player and if the big dog ai n't me then the house wo n't get guarded period
