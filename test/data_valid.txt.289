in most artists lives there is a tension between making new work and trying to control the work they have already made there is no better example than the american dancer and choreographer martha graham who died in 1991 graham 's legacy is now deadlocked in march after months of friction the board of the martha graham center for contemporary dance dismissed ron protas the legal heir to graham 's work as artistic director and a board member in turn mr protas has refused to allow the martha graham dance company to stage her works though he has licensed them to other performing groups this week in response the martha graham dance company issued a public letter signed by nearly every notable person in the dance world urging other companies not to perform graham 's works until the company reaches agreement with mr protas because of this turmoil and the inability to raise funds in such circumstances the board of the martha graham center has suspended operations in life graham was a tumultuous deeply controlling figure and sadly this crisis is largely of her own making the gift of her work to mr protas who was a devoted aide to graham late in her life but not a dancer himself was more than generous it may also have been unwise mr protas has been a fierce defender of graham 's legacy he had agreed to step aside from the martha graham center and to license graham 's works to her company for 1 a year but found it impossible to relinquish control he has alienated the board the dancers dance presenters around the world and donors who would support graham 's legacy this is an artistic tragedy graham 's work is too important to be locked away from the public by a dispute over control what is clearly needed is a way of bringing the principals together and producing an agreement that guarantees mr protas the income his right in these works was designed to produce as well as the right of the martha graham center to oversee her aesthetic legacy as only it can everyone in this sad story is determined to preserve graham 's work to ensure that it continues to matter in the years ahead that should be grounds enough for resolving this dispute
