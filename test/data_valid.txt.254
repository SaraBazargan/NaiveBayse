gov george w bush began his bid today to gain the allegiance of the middle class arguing that his tax cut plan would relieve the pressure on parents who were forced to hold more than one job to make ends meet mr bush used the issue of tax cuts to open a six day nine state drive to showcase proposals that his campaign said would help middle income americans from cradle to grave his first stop was in president clinton 's home state of arkansas which polls show to be a tossup in a line he repeated throughout the day mr bush said his plan for a 13 trillion tax cut over the next decade would give tax relief to all americans while vice president al gore 's proposal for 500 billion in targeted tax cuts would leave out millions of taxpayers my plan gives people options not orders mr bush said adding that there 's a lot of fine print in mr gore 's plan it 's so targeted that it misses the target mr bush said his drive to court the middle class came as opinion polls showed mr gore edging ahead in the presidential race making inroads with voters in households earning 50000 to 75000 a year and also making gains with women hoping to stem mr gore 's advance mr bush has put a new focus on fighting mr gore head to head on the issues at a catholic hospital in little rock ark mr bush said it was an important week in this campaign a week that speaks to the aspirations and hopes of middle class families all across the country his running mate dick cheney and his aides continued efforts today to hammer away at mr gore 's credibility karen p hughes mr bush 's communications director distributed an article from the boston globe that challenged mr gore 's assertions that his mother in law paid nearly three times as much for the same arthritis medicine that was used by his ailing dog shiloh the article said that the figures mr gore used came from a house democratic study and that mr gore 's aides could not say for sure whether his mother in law and dog actually took the drug lodine ms hughes noted that reporters had focused on how mr bush sometimes mangles words and said this is not a case of mispronunciation this is a case of direct misstatement of facts kym spell a spokeswoman for mr gore called the bush campaign 's focus on the article the latest sign the bush cheney ticket is very very desperate and she said the campaign had verified that both mr gore 's mother in law and dog had used the same drug despite mr bush 's desire to focus on issues he also made it clear that he would continue to raise questions about the vice president 's character and credibility i would rather fight the fight on issues and on philosophy mr bush said in an interview with fox news but i 'm not going to squander the opportunity i will not let this man distance himself from the previous administration his aides said that in large measure his drive this week was focused on women while democrats in recent campaigns have done better among women than republicans mr bush had made headway earlier this year by stressing education but the traditional gender gap has reopened ms hughes said the gap had occurred because mr gore had misrepresented the governor 's record and that also he 's managed to unfortunately muddy the waters on the issue of education mr bush toured the maternity ward at st vincent doctors hospital in little rock at his first stop today and delivered his speech standing next to two families with babies later this week mr bush will appear on oprah winfrey 's syndicated television program in chicago and on the regis philbin show both programs that appeal to women the governor 's wife laura was campaigning with him today asked about her husband by an audience member in little rock ark she said his best character quality is his good heart i see that every day in the way he relates to our children to our pets even mrs bush said mr gore also kept up his courtship of women today talking about health care in las vegas in a speech at the university of nevada mr gore said the issue today is whether or not we will have a president who stands up and fights for families who need health care for the women who need health care for the children all of whom should have health care and against the hmo 's and insurance companies that are always standing in the way he also spoke to health care workers at the university and was joined by the tennis star andre agassi whose mother and sister have been diagnosed with breast cancer mr bush 's emphasis on the financial problems of the middle class seems to draw inspiration from the success of mr gore 's recent appeals nearly two weeks ago mr gore released an economic blueprint with broad social goals including eliminating the national debt increasing personal savings and homeownership and reducing poverty the bush campaign countered with a 16 page booklet blueprint for the middle class which summarizes mr bush 's domestic agenda mr bush held the pamphlet aloft this pamphlet here outlines exactly what i 'm talking about he said later in in kansas city mo he credited ronald reagan for the current economic expansion saying the growth of today is occurring because of the tax cuts of the 1980 's mr bush told fox news in the interview that he would speed up tax cuts in a recession i 'm from the school of thought that it 's important during a recession to give people their money back faster he said that may cause us to run a short term deficit but the fundamental question is how to cause the economy to grow he said that middle class families were suffering from a time crunch the issue facing america today is that many of our middle class families work three jobs his hers and the joint responsibility of raising children he said i strongly believe that the tax burden on american families makes it harder for families to realize their responsibilities to do their duties he said tonight mr bush flew here and was honored by the local fraternal order of police in the group 's union hall mr bush kneeled and held a microphone for jim mullen a former police officer who was shot and paralyzed from the neck down in 1996 and is now in a wheelchair mr mullen had trouble speaking but he gasped out praise for the governor when he finished mr bush leaned over and kissed him on the forehead
