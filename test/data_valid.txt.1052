the last presidential election ended in such a mess that people tend to forget that its beginning was n't all that great either when the iowa caucuses kicked off in january everyone complained that things were starting too early the nominations were sewn up in early march and states that did n't hold their primaries in the dead of winter felt their voters had been disenfranchised supporters of lesser known candidates claimed the front loaded schedule was tailored to suit the party favorites and once the nominations were settled no one was really looking forward to an eight month race between george w bush and al gore this month the democratic national committee will meet to finalize rules for 2004 amazingly it has managed to make things worse the democrats calendar would actually push the nominating process even further toward the beginning of 2004 the new hampshire primary would be held in late january only a week after the iowa caucuses any other state could hold its primary beginning feb 3 and any state that actually intends to have an impact had better schedule its election close to groundhog day the democrats claim they were driven to the speeded up schedule by the republican party which first broke the old tradition that only iowa and new hampshire could vote before march democrats in some states particularly south carolina were enraged in 2000 when republicans held splashy early primaries while their own party rules required them to wait until later from a budgetary standpoint and from the standpoint of voter interest we felt at a disadvantage said a party spokeswoman south carolina democrats have already pushed their primary up to early february to make sure nobody steals their thunder next time around as often happens the public and the politicians have totally different arguments going on here the public wants to know why things ca n't be done better the politicians want to argue about which side is at fault obviously primaries should start slower to give lesser known candidates a chance to get their names and messages across every state should be able to make a difference at least once in a while and nobody needs a political calendar that makes the presidential election begin so early and run so long the association of secretaries of state who are in charge of voting procedures proposed holding regional primaries over several months with the dates rotating so eventually each region would get a chance to be head of the pack republicans considered a proposal at their last convention that would have let states with small populations go first so that not many electoral votes would be at stake in the earliest primaries but the idea was rejected along with any other effort at reform political regulars the sort of people found in republican and democratic rules committees do not like primaries to begin with since they divide up financial resources and force the faithful to take sides when they should be uniting against the enemy they prefer to keep moving the primaries earlier and earlier in hope of cutting off any party squabbles before the voters are paying attention the nation is moving toward the worst possible scenario one big diffuse presidential primary held in the dead of winter where only the candidates with large amounts of ready cash need apply voters will wind up choosing among men and women they barely know sooner or later one of the parties will wind up getting stuck with a real lemon someone the voters would never have picked if they had had a chance to really consider the candidates merits over a few weeks of warm weather given that the republicans show little interest in pushing the calendar back the situation is unlikely to improve until some sort of disaster brings the parties to their senses but terry mcauliffe the chairman of the democratic national committee could at least refrain from sending presidential candidates into iowa and new hampshire before the residents have taken down the christmas decorations
