not every grand event goes off without a hitch but it is safe to say that few parades have been so decisively rained on literally and otherwise as the one over which king mswati iii presided here today a ferocious thunderstorm descended on this capital city this afternoon at the climax of the annual dance of swaziland 's young women before the king who frequently uses the occasion to select candidates for his stable of wives not so today an onslaught of pea size hail sent perhaps 15000 women each one stripped to the waist for the coming of age rite fleeing the parade grounds despite urgings over loudspeakers that they channel the storm 's energy into their dancing witnesses said the hail and a subsequent cloudburst erupted just as footmen were unrolling a red carpet so that the 35 year old king could join the dance and begin his inspection when the king arrived at the stadium it was n't that serious said 17 year old bongiwe dlamini who lives with her parents and eight brothers and sisters on the capital 's outskirts but then there were huge black clouds and when the hailstones started we ran for cover it was an especially bad day in what has not been a good 12 months for the eccentric king 's extravagant and autocratic style of rule political opposition to the monarchy has been banned for 30 years since mswati 's father king sobhuza ii scrapped a british style constitution and declared himself the law rather than a figurehead monarch but open criticism of the monarchy has markedly risen this year in this landlocked nation of a million people surrounded by south africa and mozambique the bad temper is fueled by a depressed economy a public health catastrophe swaziland has one of the world 's highest hiv infection rates and life expectancy at birth is but 37 years and the king 's own taste for excess mswati or the lion as he is known here is so all powerful that his subjects address him on their knees and he can overrule court decisions and ignore his own decrees in a country where unemployment runs to 40 percent and where two in three people live in poverty he has bestowed luxury cars on his nine wives he is engaged to two more women and their mothers two years ago saying that he wanted to stop the spread of aids and promote modesty he forbade young women to wear pants and ordered them to abstain from sex until age 19 only to break his own rule not long afterward by selecting a 17 year old girl as his next wife to much disdain here mswati fined himself one ox for the offense in the last year critics have become increasingly willing to challenge royal authority in july an underground group the swaziland youth congress called for its members to carry out armed attacks against the government last month the country 's labor union staged a rare organized protest for three days blocking a major border crossing with south africa a new mswati endorsed constitution preserving most of the king 's all encompassing powers has been ridiculed by opponents but journalists who criticize royal institutions too firmly are either arrested or hounded out of their trade mswati has a firm grip on power most analysts say but these actions are chipping away at the popularity of the monarchy at the king 's flexibility to rule without question nomthetho simelanne a political scientist at the university of swaziland said in a telephone interview then there is the matter of the king 's libido mswati created a major stir last september when days after the last so called reed dance an 18 year old who was in the procession disappeared from her school apparently spirited to royal quarters to become a wife in waiting in an unheard of challenge to africa 's only remaining absolute monarch the young woman 's mother sued for her return but the courts delayed action and then the monarchy announced the couple 's engagement the king has ample precedent for such behavior his father had more than 100 wives but critics say the dances once an honored element of swazi culture have been devalued by mswati 's antics their popularity is said to have declined in recent years none of the young women interviewed after today 's rainout voiced any unhappiness at performing bare breasted for the king though i enjoy taking part in the reed dance because this culture protects my pride as a girl and this is where i can display it ms dlamini said swaziland 's state run news filled out its parade report tonight with video clips of an earlier sun washed procession adding that parade day rain is regarded as a blessing others say rural swazis regard thunderstorms as omens an observation that ms simelanne the political scientist confirmed you could come to a very ominous interpretation she said they might call it a bad omen or a sign of dissatisfaction from above
