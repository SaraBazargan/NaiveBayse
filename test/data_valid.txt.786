a scholarly show that couches a detective story albeit one of a rarified kind is being played out on the fourth floor of the yale university art gallery in new haven visitors who pay close attention and there is really no other profitable way to look at this exhibition might feel momentary frustration when they realize that no definite solution is arrived at but they will have had an enriching experience that is the complete opposite of a fast look the exhibition is changing impressions marcantonio raimondi and sixteenth century print connoisseurship the beginning of the title has a double meaning the first is that a single raimondi print the centerpiece of the show was markedly changed or altered the second implication of the title is that our impressions of the way art was collected in the past are changed by what the exhibition is revealed the renaissance apparently was not without its ruses the print at the heart of the show is the allegorical mars venus and cupid we know that it was engraved on paper on dec 16 1508 although the figures are remote their story is full of potential meaning in brief as related in homer 's odyssey and ovid 's metamorphoses mars the god of war and venus the goddess of love are having an affair even though venus is wed to vulcan iron worker to the gods in raimondi 's version of events venus is turning away from mars who has cast aside his shield and who clasps her shoulder this probably signifies that she has not yet surrendered to him or her feelings and cupid is offering venus a flaming torch symbolizing passionate love wall notes state that one can not be certain whether he mars attempts to turn her toward him or to ward off her advances this ambiguity might have appealed to the sensibility of the high renaissance a period in which there was a growing interest in psychological nuances but the drama here lies not in interpreting content but rather in technical matters to figure out what was changed and how in successive states of the raimondi print the curator richard s field and his team of scholars used scientific techniques such as ultra violet and infrared photography and x rays and analyzed the surfaces of the prints and the inks used with a microscope but they also let the visual and allegorical content of the print inform them of the significance of the changes made in the four versions of the image included in the show the four second state impressions are on parchment instead of paper which was rare but it is pointed out that it was easier to scrape away details on parchment and the intention was to make these after the fact impressions look as if they were incomplete compositions and steps along the way to the dec 16 1508 version in a parchment engraving belonging to yale the stylized flame of cupid 's torch is almost eliminated and in a parchment owned by hill stone inc in new york city the flame the torch the image on the shield as well as the entire figure of cupid have been excised the scholars argue that most of the effaced material is decorative but that cupid who is present as a kind of ghost figure is essential to the story since an outline of his shape remains the alteration is rather clumsy and a viewer with a 500 year perspective wonders who the makers of these post original parchment works thought they were fooling mindful of the fact that most of their audience are in need of background the curators begin with a demonstration through photographs taken at the meyer tannery in montgomery n y of the process of making parchment the hide of a small goat on its way to becoming parchment and removed from a tensioning rack is hung on the wall beside the demonstration the more familiar method of making paper from pulp complements this and 18th century examples come from one of the most thorough early authorities on art making denis diderot a selection of printmaking tools used in raimondi 's time is also included but the most valuable part of the exhibition may be the supplementary material that shows the fluid circumstances of printmaking many versions of a single image were commonplace raimondi remains the focus of the show even after the mars venus and cupid material has been presented two versions of the judgment of paris a panoramic composition are included and they vividly demonstrate how many successive printings can wear down an engraving plate viewers might also note that the group of three figures on the right were borrowed by manet raimondi sometimes collaborated with raphael their massacre of the innocents a masterful demonstration of chiaroscuro is included because it according to the catalog represents the extraordinary beauty that could be extracted by the artist from his plates before they began to show the inevitable signs of wear viewers might forget that they 're in a didactic show with a couple of engravings raimondi 's odd yet extraordinary work the dream of raphael might be a piece of surrealism way before its time it contains besides sleeping nudes creatures that could have been borrowed from bosch allegory of death and fame by agostino veneziano and rosso fiorentino with its gruesome cast of characters at different stages between life and death flesh and skeleton might symbolize the entire exhibition with its focus on change changing impressions is at the yale university art gallery
