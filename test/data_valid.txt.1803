jason kidd did not appreciate it when the roster hopeful john celestand held him down in a scrimmage so kidd pushed him and glared at him the two entangling for a split second before celestand came to his senses and slapped kidd on the rear in apology he was trying to slow me down so i just helped him down to the box kidd said with a slight smile after another competitive session of nets training camp one week into the preseason of a contract year kidd is making his intentions known having arrived in top shape kidd the nets captain understands that he will be asked to improve his shooting because the nets traded last season 's second leading scorer keith van horn kidd shot 391 percent from the field his lowest percentage since 1996 and he knows that could have kept him from being the league 's most valuable player if i was more of a shoot first pass second maybe my percentage would go up said kidd who has shot 403 percent for his career but the game is a lot easier when you pass and your teammates can put the ball in the basket if i shoot the ball better maybe i 'll have a better chance of winning that award but the bottom line is winning kidd who averaged 147 points 99 assists and 73 rebounds last season said he studied videotape over the summer to analyze where his shots were coming from i will try to do what the team needs on any given night he said if it 's rebounds steals i will try to get a read on it and try to do it i do n't mind scoring i 'm always going to shoot it when the game is on the line nets coach byron scott said that when tim duncan edged kidd for the mvp award last season kidd 's well documented weakness was the reason that 's all i heard that he only shot 39 percent scott said scott expects kidd 's shooting to improve because he is more comfortable with the system he 'll have a better year than he did last year scott said i think he 'll be a little more aggressive offensively kidd 's backup chris childs was relieved that an exam last week showed tendinitis but no structural damage in his right achilles tendon you always hope that you do n't have a tear or a rupture childs said a lot of guys have ended their career with something like that the nets do not expect him to be ready in time for the season opener on oct 30
