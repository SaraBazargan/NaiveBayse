in a sudden new age of anxiety we may need new role models in sports abruptly coach joe paterno 's loss of imperial power at penn state and michael jordan 's decision to reclaim his place among superpowers have lost their hold on our moral imagination have you noticed that we have n't asked tiger woods to share his secrets for staying focused and picking his spots through a long campaign that we have n't pleaded with barry bonds for tips on reducing stress while under pressure we may have to go to strength here to the wives of our professional athletes the women who deal with reality every day while their husbands entertain us with their games and themselves with their slump buster groupies i think baseball players wives take care of too many things for their husbands one baseball wife said to the sociologist steven m ortiz who relayed her comments while preserving her anonymity they pamper them wake them late keep all the kids quiet in the house because daddy 's sleeping postpone trips because of daddy and induce babies because of daddy it 's not normal what you want to strive for is to create a normal lifestyle within an abnormal lifestyle ortiz created a mild stir recently when oregon state where he is an assistant professor of sociology issued a news release that plucked some juicy phrases from a paper he had presented in august at the american sociological association 's annual meeting there was a culture of adultery in professional sports ortiz wrote and athletes had a fast food sex mentality really had he researched his dissertation at the gold club in atlanta and by watching court tv turns out ortiz has something interesting perhaps even useful to offer in the early 1990 's as a doctoral student at the university of california at berkeley he interviewed and reinterviewed 48 wives of professional athletes most of them wives of baseball and football players these women are so strong said ortiz speaking from his office in corvallis ore they are able to normalize what others could n't even cope with although often with such negative strategies as denial they are married to men for whom team loyalty is more powerful than marriage men who are not emotionally connected to women the women were so isolated by the needs of their husbands careers ortiz found they were eager to talk to him some regarded him almost as a therapist their complaints often seemed like calls for help no team psychologist would ever answer unless a title was at stake as one wife told ortiz these guys are babied and spoiled and pampered totally in my mind they lose a sense of reality they have no responsibilities and for the most part they have no cares the environment they are in conditions them to be this way ortiz 's most ambitious paper the yet unpublished the spoiled athlete syndrome doing masculinity as doing power in the sport marriage makes some provocative statements that demand more psychological underpinnings in particular he says he discovered in his study that the controlling mother ie the sport version of the 'stage mother or 'pageant mom was the primary sport socializer in the athletic life of her son this contradicts the prevailing wisdom that a father or father figure often a coach is the key adult ortiz maintains that the coddling and special treatment the young athlete receives from mom even when there is a dad present becomes the basis of male dominance and misogyny that will enable him to conceal deep personal and occupational insecurities as the wives in ortiz 's study reveal these sports stars with their postures of cool poise and threats of violent behavior are often passive even incompetent in the simple decision making process of running a home or a family they cover up with bluster with little boy wheedling with reminders that all the money and status flows from them like their husbands mothers these wives are also enablers ortiz says they tend to be very strong intelligent and resilient which is why the men married them in the first place as they take over more and more of the off field management of their husbands lives they become newer and improved versions of the controlling stage mother there is often a power struggle between the wife and the mother and the athlete enjoying his role as the spoiled kid sees how much he can get away with including often indiscreet sex with other women as the wife takes greater control she is emasculating her husband off the field one wife said what we literally do is clip their wings and we 're the man woman at home it 's almost like we do n't need them because the paycheck comes in and they 're gone so much the scary reality is you learn to live alone and he 's a guest in his own home ortiz who is writing a book tentatively titled family games imagines that the wives of rock music and movie stars even of corporate executives and doctors the ones with the god complexes he said deal with similar issues but the athlete who has been infantilized so he can be controlled by mom coach agent owner presents a wife with a special set of problems the luckiest athlete is one who has picked a woman who can deal with those problems even after his athletic career is over these are strong women who know how to acknowledge crisis and stress ortiz said they do n't talk about putting something behind them over and over again i would hear them say 'you just learn to go with the flow
