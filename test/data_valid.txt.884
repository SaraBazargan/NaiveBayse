when i was a child i did not know that the circus had an intermission the moment the break came in the show my mother would stand up and say well was n't that wonderful and sweep us toward the exit of madison square garden faster than you could say ringling barnum and bailey she was willing to do her duty to entertain the children but like many parents she had her limits my siblings and i returned home sticky from cotton candy blissfully unaware that we had missed half the show and as she always warned me the nut does n't fall far from the tree i managed to shepherd my own children through their early years without purchasing a tape by raffi or visiting disney world but kids are kids and as soon as you 've committed to having them your entertainment options are drastically altered forever or at least for a couple of decades that seem like forever as a mother you begin to notice that cultural life as you once knew it is over during the first months of pregnancy any entertainment options that extend let alone begin past 8 pm are out of the question because you are just too tired still you have that horrible this is my last chance feeling about which you are entirely correct and may still waddle to a museum catch an early movie or attend a show 's matinee the first foray into the new entertainment world you have plunged into often comes with nursing never before having watched television at 4 am i discovered some fascinating programming the one show that i remember is something called ugly george in which a horrible looking man walked the streets of new york and persuaded young women to take their shirts and bras off for the camera this was in the early 1980 's and i was stunned luckily my newborn daughter could not focus her eyes yet so i did n't have to worry about viewing content by the time she was 3 though my husband and i were wringing our hands over cartoon violence i remember having a serious discussion about whether a mickey mouse tape called mickey 's garden might induce bad dreams it was a first child i wo n't reveal here how young my second one was when he watched his first r rated movie it was also during this period that i found sesame street to be a really good show disney soon became a huge part of our lives while i successfully avoided its amusement parks i was grateful to the company for consistently turning out movies that were enjoyable to watch with my children moreover these movies had an amazing hypnotic power so that a child could happily sit through the little mermaid or brave little toaster videos 17 times this guaranteed a parent nearly two hours to prepare a meal meet a deadline or for the truly ambitious who owned two vcr 's to themselves watch a movie that was not rated g every generation seems to have its epochal cartoon toy marketing phenomena i feel blessed that i have no need to know any of the pokemon characters or who the teletubbies are but there was a time i could have told you the name of every teenage mutant ninja turtle and his defining personality trait to boot i was pretty much on top of the care bears for a while too other parents have suffered through rainbow brite my little pony cabbage patch kids x men and countless others there was a brief halcyon period during which the kids were old enough not to like little kid entertainment but young enough to listen to their parents it was during this time that i got to play the beatles the beach boys and the rolling stones on the car radio and that we vacationed in national parks though we used chocolate to propel them up longer hiking trails during this time too we could enjoy movies like the sound of music which requires only a brief explanation of nazis and west side story some violence and sex i know there are families who raise their children on mozart expose them to the opera and maybe even discuss great literature we were not one of them at christmas when my daughter was 6 i dutifully took her to a production of the nutcracker it was not a great success we left at intermission not that she knew the day came when i was really getting down in my car listening to the pretenders and my daughter asked if we could please turn off the oldies music this was a blow and a crossroads as i was spluttering that this music was cutting edge i realized it was more than 20 years old worse i found that for some time i had been unknowingly listening to the oldies station which played music from the 60 's 70 's and 80 's soon when my children became fans of the radio station z 100 there came a rosemary 's baby  like phenomenon in which words began coming out of my mouth that were in fact my parents' things like how can you listen to this junk and this is n't music this is noise the battle of the radio tuner began i held the line at alanis morrisette because i had to listen to enough whining at home i thought i was a pretty hip mom and soon grew to like some of the songs on z 100 but by then it was too late they had moved on to a rap station and i will never warm to tupac shakur on the other hand at this stage new entertainment options opened the good news was that we were now able to go to the movies together the bad news was that the children did n't want to be seen in pubic with their parents this i think is the reason multiplexes were invented we could be at the same theater and see different films with children it 's called parallel play there still remained some family entertainment options the theater which was expensive enough to constitute a rare event and one at which they were unlikely to be seen by any of their friends and professional sporting events which seemed to cut across age boundaries at this stage too i realized that much of our entertainment seemed to be watching our children on athletic fields at recitals and in school concerts one of my parenting milestones was when my youngest child graduated from elementary school and i realized that i never again had to listen to the fourth grade orchestra 's violin section struggle with the can can now we 're on to the next phase rock concerts and trips to manhattan without parental supervision during the high school years there seems to be a progression from it 's out of the question to ok but i 'm going with you to i 'm coming with you but i 'll sit in a different section  walk 10 steps behind you to ok but i 'm driving you there and will be parked right at the exit after the concert event to fine but be careful this you would think would be the time to break out and explore all those wonderful cultural and entertainment options we 've been missing out on except of course we ca n't stray too far from home while they 're out in case something god forbid happens once the children are off on their own and we are at a stage when we have the time and resources to travel all sorts of new entertainment options will open up who knows the theater in london the louvre in paris a wine  tasting tour of tuscany they are all tantalizing possibilities until of course grandchildren come along i wonder if disneyland will still be open
