in what appears to be the longest and most substantive of his conversations with foreign leaders president bush initiated a 15 minute telephone call to president vladimir v putin of russia today mr putin raised the case of a former kremlin aide now under arrest in new york on charges of money laundering russian officials said white house officials said little about the telephone call less in fact than the russians did and would not say whether the two men had talked about mr bush 's hopes of building a national missile defense mr putin has been leading an international campaign to persuade other nations to oppose the program but mr putin did raise the case of pavel p borodin who is being held in new york under a swiss arrest warrant on charges that he took tens of millions of dollars in kickbacks from swiss contractors renovating the kremlin russian officials have demanded his release under president boris n yeltsin mr borodin was the head of kremlin administration the equivalent of a chief of staff for property and building management this week he was replaced as state secretary for the union between russia and belarus according to a russian statement mr putin expressed the hope that a solution will be found for this problem which will correspond both to legal and humanitarian principles the russians said the appeal was met by g bush with understanding a white house official said the united states considered the case a legal issue meaning that mr bush did not plan to interfere the white house also said mr bush had responded on tuesday in writing to a recent letter from mr putin american officials described the putin letter as a call for engagement but without any new proposals in the discussion today the two leaders agreed to a rough schedule of contacts between their top officials and agreed to meet soon thereafter under the current schedule however mr bush and mr putin would not come face to face until a meeting of major industrial nations in italy early in the summer that may suit the white house which has quietly indicated that it wants to move slowly in dealings with mr putin while it sorts out both the political and the technological challenges of missile defense the kremlin in its statement today said only that the two leaders had agreed to find mutually acceptable solutions to problematic questions building a missile defense would require amendments to the 1972 anti ballistic missile agreement mr bush 's defense secretary donald h rumsfeld said last week that if necessary the united states could abandon the treaty but that might open a breach in relations with russia that mr bush is unlikely to want to risk so early in his presidency china has also expressed objections to a missile system and president jacques chirac of france criticized the plan several days ago while the two leaders duel over missiles mr bush may soon face the problem that plagued the clinton administration russia 's reluctance to enact economic reforms officials from the international monetary fund are in moscow this week to review russia 's compliance with reforms that it agreed to during its 1998 financial crisis with the exception of some tax reforms mr putin has moved on few of those issues in an interview earlier this month president bush expressed doubt that the monetary fund had given russia the right advice he suggested that he might want to review the economic relationship
