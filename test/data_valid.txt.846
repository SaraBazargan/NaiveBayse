the election night blowout at the astor crowne plaza in the french quarter last weekend was something rare in republican politics a truly biracial event but even though 33 percent of louisiana and 67 percent of new orleans is black there was scarcely a black reveler there the mix of people celebrating bobby jindal 's first round win in this year 's governor 's race was an unusual one whites and indian americans california 's new governor has been grabbing all the headlines but mr jindal 's odyssey has been nearly as remarkable at the age of 32 he has an almost freakishly impressive resume at 24 he was running louisiana 's hospital system but perhaps more notable in a state where an ex ku klux klan grand wizard david duke made a real run for the governor 's office mr jindal is the dark skinned son of immigrants from india as mr jindal moves on to a nov 15 runoff against lt gov kathleen blanco he has a chance to make history he would be the nation 's first indian american governor and one of the few elected officials from an ethnic group that now numbers nearly two million and he would be louisiana 's first nonwhite governor since p b s pinchback served for 35 days during reconstruction but if mr jindal 's success is a sign of racial progress and it is it also has elements that suggest how far we still have to go mr jindal who was born in baton rouge wasted little time adopting louisiana ways as a small child he announced he was trading in his given name of piyush for bobby in his teens he converted to catholicism he then breezed through brown university and became a rhodes scholar gov mike foster who is prevented by term limits from running this year appointed mr jindal hospitals chief and made him president at age 27 of the university of louisiana system mr jindal was an assistant secretary of the bush administration 's department of health and human services before announcing for governor the fast talking mr jindal presented himself as a problem solver with conservative views including opposition to affirmative action mr jindal began the campaign with strong backing from mr foster but it still seemed his ethnicity might rule him out louisiana which is barely 1 percent asian has little experience with indian americans and the south historically fixated on blacks and whites has had trouble knowing what to make of people who are neither in 1927 the supreme court ruled that mississippi was within its rights to make martha lum a chinese girl attend a colored school rather than a white one one black legislator dismissed mr jindal 's candidacy early on calling him according to the associated press too dark for the white folks and not dark enough for the blacks but that was wrong it certainly seemed possible mr jindal would be too dark for louisiana whites a majority of whom backed mr duke in his runs for senator and governor in the early 1990 's but mr jindal who has been embraced by the religious right apparently won upward of 40 percent of the white vote last week nor was mr jindal not dark enough for blacks whites like senator mary landrieu have racked up as much as 96 percent of the black vote mr jindal 's problem and the reason his pioneering candidacy attracted only a handful of black votes last weekend is his stand on the issues and the fact that in a campaign filled with 18 point programs he has scarcely addressed the special problems of louisiana blacks mr jindal 's ethnicity which has drawn little attention so far could be a factor in the runoff in last weekend 's crowded field democratic candidates won 57 percent of the vote to win ms blanco needs only to hold on to that base but mr jindal has to hunt for new support he has made modest efforts to woo blacks but is unlikely to get far to win he will need overwhelming white support if even a small percentage of white conservatives hold his ethnicity against him it could cost him the election a win by mr jindal would raise a different set of racial questions blacks who have run for governor in recent years got less than 35 percent of the vote it may be that they were too liberal but it may also be that the state remains resistant to a black governor if mr jindal wins it may mean not that race no longer matters in louisiana but simply that in a change from the days of martha lum asian americans now fall on the white side of the racial divide if mr jindal is louisiana 's next governor he will be hailed by national republicans as a symbol of inclusion a new colin powell or j c watts but he will be a hollow symbol if he ends the white lock on the governor 's mansion despite overwhelming opposition from the state 's blacks if the republican party really wants to be inclusive in louisiana and nationally it needs to start finding nonwhite candidates that nonwhites want to vote for
