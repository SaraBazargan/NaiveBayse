saddam hussein 's recent decision to move the adnan republican guard division from its base near the northern city of mosul toward central iraq appears to have provided the final clue the iraqi leader it seems does not plan to mount a determined defense of his borders some military experts say the indications are that he plans to make his stand in baghdad playing the starring role in a drama intended to portray his government as a victim holding out against the advancing americans it is as much a political strategy as a military one the iraqi government 's political calculation apparently is that it can use a prolonged siege of baghdad to stir up opposition on the arab street and in european capitals to the bush administration 's drive to topple mr hussein the iraqi leader baghdad 's residents in effect would be pawns in the game their plight would be exploited to elicit the world 's sympathy and to complicate american efforts to take the city up to now iraq 's approach has been to offer just enough cooperation with united nations inspectors to cause gridlock in the united nations security council and to fortify popular opposition to a war in nations like turkey which the bush administration has sought to use to open a northern front but even mr hussein probably understands that this strategy is probably not be enough to stop the administration from proceeding with its invasion plans so mr hussein also seems to be trying to shape the endgame reading an adversary 's intentions is an art not a science the spy satellites listing equipment and other reconnaissance technology on which the americans rely certainly help but in the end deciphering the enemy 's plans is often a matter of informed speculation by intelligence experts military officers and policy officials the united states has not always drawn the right conclusions during the persian gulf war in 1991 the united states central command assumed that the iraqi military would stand and fight and use chemical weapons instead iraq 's republican guard pulled up stakes and ran when it saw that it had been outflanked by the united states army iraq apparently fearful of retaliation did not use poison gas or germ weapons while the war in 1991 was easier than expected the failure by the united states to anticipate rapid success on the battlefield had a cost much of the republican guard got away there is a cautionary lesson in that experience capt will dewes the commanding officer of the aegis cruiser called the shiloh offered a wise word of counsel when a reporter visited the cruiser in the persian gulf in october the main iraqi threat as far as i am concerned is something we have n't thought about he said that said the pattern of iraqi deployments and recent statements by mr hussein provide useful clues the defense of baghdad is entrusted to the special republican guard which is inside the city and the three republican guard divisions that surround it american intelligence believes that the adnan division is probably being sent to guard tikrit mr hussein 's hometown north of baghdad but the adnan could always be shifted south toward the capital the hussein government has never trusted the regular army well enough to allow it to venture close to baghdad and does not even now the role of the regular army considered less capable and less motivated than the republican guard has been to keep the kurds at bay and to suppress rebellions by shiites in the south military analysts say that means mr hussein can be expected to cede control of the north and south to superior american and allied forces while he prepares a final stand in baghdad or possibly tikrit where some american officials believe he may go when all is lost beyond that there are a lot of unknowns using chemical or germ weapons could slow the americans down though it would not stop them since those forces are equipped with chemical defensive gear but it would also confirm the american and british allegations that iraq is hiding weapons of mass destruction thus undermining mr hussein 's efforts to portray himself as the victim of the bush administration 's designs to redraw the geopolitical map of the middle east the same goes for blowing up dams or setting iraqi oil fields on fire the scorched earth policy american intelligence says iraq is planning mr hussein stressed in his cbs television interview with dan rather that he has no intention of destroying iraq 's infrastructure another move that could slow an allied advance at the expense of harming his government 's image that may be true or may simply mean that iraqi forces intend to blow up the dams and ignite the oil wells and blame it on the united states mr hussein justified iraq 's development of al samoud 2 missiles in that interview just days before destruction of the weapons began even the experts differ while the defense intelligence agency has sounded the alarms over a scorched earth strategy walter p lang a former defense intelligence agency official and the agency 's analyst on the middle east during the 1991 war disagrees mr hussein 's project he says is not to lay waste to iraq 's resources in a desperate effort to hold on to power but to stand firm in baghdad and fight an invading western army to the end his attitudes toward his own territory and resources are different mr lang said you have to take seriously how he sees himself what he is working on is building a legend in arab history that for a thousand years arab schoolchildren will write poetry about him the american military has the forces and skills to prevail including in urban warfare but for american planners it is not only important that the american military triumphs it is also important how it wins it wants to be seen as a liberator and not an occupying army the images the american military wants to see on al jazeera are thousands of iraqis cheering the american and british forces as the invaders head north from kuwait into shiite dominated southern iraq already chafing under mr hussein 's rule before rumbling toward baghdad it wants a quick war and a friendly welcome in baghdad the government 's bastion and locus of power not a long miserable siege with growing anxiety around the world about the fate of iraq 's civilians in his interview with cbs news mr hussein portrayed the american military as occupiers who would be resisted and resented by iraqis determined to defend their arab heritage against western invaders mr bush sent the opposite message in his recent speech to the american enterprise institute he said american forces would remove a repressive government provide the iraqi people with food protect the nation 's resources help iraq build a democracy and then leave the war has not begun but the struggle to shape iraqi and international perceptions about the likely battle of baghdad is already under way
