when he flew over manhattan for the first time last week ron dixon acknowledged that he leaned toward the commercial jet 's window nearly pressing his nose against it my eyes were just so wide open said dixon the giants new wide receiver and surprise third round draft pick i could n't believe it when he arrived inside the locker room he was introduced to some of his new colleagues including his fellow receiver amani toomer in conversation a few minutes later dixon referred to his new teammate as mr toomer then he was directed to his dressing quarters with so many rookies and free agents trying out for the team last week a number of players shared lockers dixon was paired with ron dayne the heisman trophy winner college football 's career rushing leader and the giants first round draft pick dixon looked at the two nameplates above the locker stall from the top to the bottom he said and when television cameras and reporters soon crowded around dayne dixon retreated to a corner i 'm just a country boy said dixon who played one year of football at lambuth university in jackson tenn our media was one guy with a pad a week after the giants plucked dixon from the obscurity of the national association of intercollegiate athletics school he remained the most intriguing new face on the team at 6 feet 1 inch and 183 pounds with spindly arms and legs he was the receiver that coaches players and team executives stopped to watch during last week 's minicamp workouts dixon put on a good show he displayed his speed and perhaps more important he caught just about everything thrown to him even in traffic over the middle granted with no one in pads and no hitting it was an appraisal that had its limitations but the overall impression was that dixon needed time to fill out but that he had talent quick moves and the innate ability to run fast i see a guy who 's raw but very comfortable on the field coach jim fassel said we knew he could run but he also makes quick change of direction moves he 's shifty he certainly caught backup quarterback jason garrett and dayne by surprise on one play during friday morning 's workout dixon went in motion the wrong way as the ball was being snapped and barreled over garrett and dayne in the backfield dixon came up with a thigh bruise that kept him out of that afternoon 's workout those things are going to happen fassel said with a smile this is all new to him going from the naia to the national football league is about as big a jump as a football player can make but there were signs that dixon 's presence was not the fluke it might seem to be there was an interesting interchange between dixon and giants wide receiver ike hilliard a former first round pick after a celebrated career at florida the two clearly knew each other how they were together on a recruiting trip to florida in 1994 that year dixon a highly recruited high school prospect from wildwood fla did not score high enough on college entrance exams to qualify for a division i scholarship and ended up at itawamba community college in mississippi after two seasons he enrolled at division ii west georgia but did not apply himself scholastically there either and left the school in less than a year out of football and working various jobs dixon said he sat down on may 20 1997 and wrote a list of eight goals for himself things like get back into college earn at least a 30 academic average play football be the best receiver in the league get drafted by an nfl team there were a few others that dixon politely declined to divulge i saw my life passing me by and i got fed up said dixon who will be 24 next month i would stay up nights and think about all the opportunities i had let go by they were n't anybody else 's fault when i got to college i wanted to go out and see all the things i had n't see before i wanted to party by 1997 i saw that things were slipping away i wrote down what i wanted to do and i put it in my bible back home he lived at home while going to two junior colleges trying to get the credits he needed to apply to bigger football schools he wanted to play football at a national collegiate athletic association school but by 1999 his five years of ncaa eligibility had expired the naia became his best chance and a friend referred him to lambuth he played in games attended by about 300 fans but the number included nfl scouts i never gave up the dream dixon said but i do n't know if i ever thought it would come true his first taste of pro football now concluded dixon is trying to digest what he saw and get accustomed to being a giant it 's been an interesting few days dixon said some things i 'll still have to get used to like running through the tunnel at giants stadium for the first time dixon paused again a bit wide eyed i might have to take a minute there to take that in he said that 's going to be unbelievable
