felt there was a revival of their faith in december 1979 the new york times invited professor smith to join other scholars for a discussion on the iranian revolution he said that there was a belief among muslims in the middle east that an era of backwardness was ending and that the change had to entail a rejection of western influence he said americans upset by the takeover of their embassy in tehran should understand that young iranians had felt victimized by western support for the government of the shah overthrown by the revolutionaries what is it that we have done amiss in the past few

by publication of the meaning and end of religion macmillan 1963 john l esposito a theologian who is the director of the center for muslim christian understanding at georgetown university said professor smith argued in the book that the western belief that religion is a private matter is a recent concept a product of the enlightenment professor smith wrote that two centuries ago the word religion meaning christianity judaism islam or another faith broadly meant a way of life professor esposito said it 's still a pioneering concept when you look at debates over fundamentalism and the

live people passing through those institutions and their lives would be shaped by doctoral requirements while on his second tour at harvard professor smith completed a book on religious pluralism towards a world theology westminster 1981 in which he argued it was possible to discern historical and metaphysical connections among the major religious faiths that becomes a real basis for dialogue among scholars of different faiths said william a graham professor of the history of religion and islamic studies at harvard and chairman of its department of near eastern languages and civilizations he was much more concerned with trying to forge intellectual corridors of interchange whereby very serious people in their own communities could understand very serious people in other communities said professor graham who studied under professor smith in the 60 's professor carman said that despite professor smith 's interest in developing a theology of the human race he was rooted in his canadian protestantism there was a kind of old fashioned conservatism about his style professor carman said in a very basic sense saying your prayers was important in addition to his wife and son
