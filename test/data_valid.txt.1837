at least vinny testaverde looked good on the coin toss that was the extent of the work testaverde and every other jets starter except the rookie defensive tackle dewayne robertson got in tonight 's preseason finale a 17 9 victory over the philadelphia eagles jets coach herman edwards suspecting that his eagles counterpart andy reid would not play his starters told his team 10 minutes before the game that the starters had the night off edwards said the decision had nothing to do with chad pennington 's injury last week but more to do with the desire to rest the starters after a lengthy preseason that included five games one of them in tokyo the result means testaverde who expected to take about a dozen snaps in his final preparation before starting the regular season opener next thursday night against washington took just 21 snaps in two preseason games he attempted 14 passes and completed 6 with one interception testaverde will be healthy and fresh for the season but probably rusty the decision to sideline him tonight opens edwards up to second guessing if the jets get off to a slow start i felt we had four preseason games edwards said if he goes for 10 plays how much rhythm is he going to get we 've got a short week you have to take that into consideration you want to feel good and fresh from the opening game you do n't want to be tired the rookie marquel blackwell who is likely to be released this week finished the preseason with more passes attempted than testaverde i felt really ready tonight and i guess i 'm disappointed i did n't get to get out there testaverde said we 'll make sure that we get the proper amount of work that we need to be sharp next week at this time i 'll be fine i felt good last week against the giants testaverde added i felt very comfortable and i 'm going to have to work extra hard this week in practice it is what it is i 'm not concerned about it all the hard work that we 've put in during practice has me confident that we 'll be ready the jets offensive coordinator paul hackett concurred with edwards 's decision because of the short week the jets face and he rattled off testaverde 's career statistics 182 starts nearly 40000 yards passing 244 touchdowns still he warned that it could take a few weeks for testaverde to find his rhythm i would love to have gotten him more but i 'm counting on experience hackett said the jets also missed another opportunity to get their running game on track even though it will take on added importance as the offense makes the shift to a new quarterback running back curtis martin who did not play in the game in tokyo and did not take a handoff in three snaps against cincinnati rushed just 14 times for 19 yards an average of 14 yards per carry in the preseason last week with most of the starters playing in the first half the jets rushed for 26 yards martin said he gets ready for the regular season not in preseason games but during practice so the night of rest was of little concern to him the running game is getting better and better and i saw it this week in practice martin said the offensive line is coming together and i 've seen them putting it together through their efforts and the better chemistry they 've shown we are definitely ready going through practice and those two a days that 's where you get ready extra points the rookie quarterback marquel blackwell started for the jets and played well completing 7 of 11 passes for 111 yards and two touchdowns to jonathan carter and bj askew todd husak who was signed this week after chad pennington was injured played in the second half completing 5 of 6 passes for 25 yards jamie martin who was signed this week and is expected to be testaverde 's backup was in uniform but did not play
