if it is really the thought that counts then people who give holiday gifts should not care if their present is returned to the store or exchanged for something else right but what about when the recipient smiles says thank you then turns around and gives the gift to someone else it is called a regift and lots of people do it although most will also deny doing it most people regive in secret because it is usually considered ungrateful and ungracious the fact remains though that many people get gifts they do not want or need so many apparently that a variety of web sites and e commerce practices have sprung up to handle the volume it is possible to register gifts you do not want online to barter for something else a georgia inventor has won a patent for a method of regiving items ordered online when they turn out to be white elephants with the patent issued to william dodd from marietta a present could become a virtual gift that only lightly touches down in the recipient 's e mail box before being rejected and passed on to someone else with the click of a mouse many people might react to mr dodd 's idea with distaste seeing it as another example of technology making the world less friendly and less genteel on the other hand it could find ready acceptance with the youngest generation of gift givers those accustomed to using the internet as a shortcut for many social conventions here is mr dodd 's idea let us say your uncle goes online to order you his favorite fruitcake instead of shipping the loaf to you the fruitcake web site would dispatch an e mail message notifying you of your uncle 's kindness and asking whether you want to accept the gift return it exchange it or pass it along to someone else thus you can assess the gift without actually taking possession of it if you already have several fruitcakes you do not have to box up the one from uncle and take it back to the post office if you choose to pass it along the fruitcake site would ask for contact information for your lucky or unlucky friend or relative but does it also mean the fruitcake you reject could wander through cyberspace passing from one unsuspecting recipient to another in a never ending game of electronic follow the bouncing ball the intent is that there be a time limit said mr dodd who has helped establish several online retail and marketing technology companies a retailer might rule that a gift could be forwarded only once he added or the service might work like the children 's game of hot potato say it went through four people in two days mr dodd explained whoever eventually stopped forwarding say for a seven day period or whatever parameters the retailer put in it would be shipped to that person he said time limits were necessary from a practical point of view the gift eventually has to ship because whoever the gift is purchased from has to complete the transaction he said retailers might also impose time limits because they specialize in seasonal products that have limited consumer appeal there are two types of retailers that we address with this mr dodd said one is the more seasonal retailer as opposed to retailers like estee lauder which always carry their own products and could put on longer time limits mr dodd also owns an earlier patent that we actually refer to as the 'fruitcake patent he said it covers a method of exchanging a gift before it is shipped that mr dodd named giftmail he said online retailers like the cosmetics company origins had tested the giftmail service do they include a history of a gift 's travels in their records if a recipient decided to exchange a gift or forward it to someone else would that be possible without the giver or the next recipient finding out really it 's up to the site that implements the technology but that is certainly the intent that the sender would never know he said the same should be true for the people in the re give chain mr dodd received patent no6633849 for methods and systems for electronically forwarding an online gift his earlier patent issued in 2001 for exchanging unwanted gifts online is 6321211 he said the company that owns both patents richfx inc of atlanta hopes to use them in two ways to license to online retailers and as a subcontractor providing the technology
