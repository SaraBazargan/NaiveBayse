the pentagon says it is not counting the bodies of opposing fighters in the latest battle in afghanistan but nearly every day since the american led offensive began the military has produced a classified estimate for senior officials of al qaeda and taliban dead at the start of the week the pentagon estimate listed the confirmed number of dead arab chechen and other fighters for al qaeda at 517 another 250 were believed to have been killed but the deaths were listed as unconfirmed by today the total estimate had risen above 800 according to one official those numbers are all extremely fuzzy said one senior military officer the body count estimates are just that they are based on reports from apache helicopter pilots who often spot fighters before firing missiles on gun camera film taken by combat aircraft on video images from unmanned predator drones and on reports by special forces troops on the ground among others even though helicopters and high technology surveillance systems can blow away some of the fog of war military officials acknowledge that these sources have limitations cameras and pilots can not peer into caves for instance or assess the number of dead in the two villages that were laid waste by bombs nor is an american pilot 's count of opposing fighters in a mountain redoubt before he fires always completely certain even if it is there may be little in the way of remains to list a qaeda fighter as confirmed dead does not necessarily mean that the military has a body journalists who toured the shah i kot valley where the recent fighting has taken place saw only three bodies today page a18 still the estimates exist despite the assertions of pentagon officials that they are not in the body count business defense secretary donald h rumsfeld has made it clear to his senior advisers and military commanders that he is against releasing the numbers fearing any echoes from vietnam of body counts often inflated that haunted his predecessors i do n't do body counts mr rumsfeld said last week in a cbs news interview this country tried that in vietnam and it did n't work and you 've not heard me speculate on that at all and you wo n't the morning briefing given to gen tommy r franks the commander of the war in afghanistan does not contain precise enemy casualties said a spokesman at the central command maj brad lowell the cinc general franks relies on his commanders on the ground to make those assessments major lowell said some senior pentagon officials expressed irritation that the commander of operation in shah i kot maj gen franklin l hagenbeck spoke so explicitly about al qaeda deaths in the campaign 's opening days but other senior officers said his candor shed welcome light on a complicated operation and in no way compromised the mission our estimation is that in the last 24 48 hours the number of enemy that we fought over time is somewhere in the neighborhood of 600 to 700 enemies general hagenbeck commander of the 10th mountain division said on march 6 conservatively speaking right now i 'm convinced from the evidence that i have seen that we have killed at least half of those enemy forces military commanders say that unlike in vietnam they are not using the closely held figures to measure their battlefield achievements instead the estimates of enemy dead are used to help plan operations this is less about the numbers than about assessing the enemy 's strength said one senior officer barry r mccaffrey a retired army general and highly decorated vietnam veteran said gauging enemy deaths is just one component that field commanders consider when weighing an opponent 's effectiveness what you do is estimate enemy casualties general mccaffrey said you also ask 'did we bust them up did they leave the area with or without their weapons in the latest campaign the fierce fighting and rugged terrain have for the most part kept reporters at a distance but in any case it is impossible to count the dead in a cave that has been sealed by bombs or those in two qaeda controlled villages sirkankel and marzak that were leveled by bombs in fact pentagon officials said most of deaths of opposing fighters were from high powered ordnance satellite guided 2000 pound bombs and hellfire missiles as opposed to firefights at close range in this 12 day operation alone american warplanes have dropped more than 2500 bombs such munitions often leave little behind in cases where there was a body a pentagon official said al qaeda fighters may have placed many of their fallen comrades in makeshift graves following the muslim custom of burying the dead within 24 hours further complicating the count is the confusion over the number of fighters who joined the battle the pentagon now acknowledges that it badly underestimated the size of al qaeda forces entering the battle after initially putting the count at 150 to 200 fighters american intelligence officials now believe as many as 1000 were holed up in the battle zone some poured in from nearby redoubts after the operation started officials said of the 1000 or so original fighters pentagon officials estimate that about 100 remain in ever smaller pockets of resistance another 100 have probably fled over mountain trails military officials said brig gen john w rosa deputy director of current operations for the joint chiefs of staff acknowledged that small numbers of fighters may have slipped out but he said unlike at tora bora in december the american led coalition had largely sealed off the area we 've got troops in position in the high ground guarding the escape routes and i think we 're doing a pretty good job he said
