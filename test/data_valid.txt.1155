ronald o perelman has made a large contrarian bet on revlon the ailing cosmetics company he controls spending perhaps as much as 250 million to buy back zero coupon junk bonds secured by nearly half of his 835 percent stake in revlon according to an executive briefed on mr perelman 's plans the investment amounts to a sizable bet that revlon which has lost money the last eight quarters will ultimately return to profitability based on revlon 's stock price of 495 a share yesterday the value of mr perelman 's entire stake in the company has fallen 91 percent since april 1998 to just 212 million from 24 billion in recent months mr perelman has apparently been quietly buying the junk bonds which had fallen to a low of 15 cents on the dollar in january mr perelman raised 770 million in february 1997 by issuing the bonds secured by 20 million of his revlon shares although the bonds were issued by an entity called the revlon worldwide parent corporation they were not an obligation of revlon itself but rather a means for mr perelman to raise cash by pledging some of his shares the revlon worldwide bonds were scheduled to mature next march and junk bond analysts who follow the company have been guessing what course mr perelman would take to meet the obligation though mr perelman would probably have preferred to refinance the bonds current weakness in the junk bond market would make that difficult he could have turned over the 20 million shares to bondholders because some of mr perelman 's remaining shares have supervoting provisions he would have retained control of the company even though his ownership stake would have fallen below 50 percent but mr perelman apparently loath to part with so much revlon stock and seemingly convinced that it is undervalued instead bought up bonds with 630 million in face value according to the executive mr perelman could not be reached for comment this makes it clear that he has tremendous confidence in revlon the executive said mr perelman has owned the cosmetics company since 1985 when he acquired it in a 18 billion hostile takeover backed by financing from drexel burnham lambert mr perelman is expected to file documents shortly with the securities and exchange commission offering to swap the remaining 140 million in bonds for new securities which are expected to mature in 2004 and be secured by up to 73 million shares of revlon stock it is not clear how much mr perelman spent to repurchase the bonds which have slowly risen in price over the last year reaching a high of 70 cents on the dollar last month assuming a price in the middle of the range or 40 cents on the dollar mr perelman would have spent as much as 250 million to buy back the bonds they have recently fallen back to 60 cents presumably as mr perelman stopped buying
