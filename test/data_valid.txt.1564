some of the havoc attributed to solar storms including disrupted radio communications and shorted out power grids is actually caused by the reaction of the earth 's atmosphere to the streams of solar energy scientists say new data from a nasa satellite that monitors space weather proves that the earth is not just a passive target for solar storms but also an active participant that helps generate some of the damaging effects researchers have told the space agency that the planet 's outer atmosphere acts as a shield to deflect and absorb some of the potentially damaging high energy plasma particles that stream from the sun in the process the researchers said a small part of the oxygen in the upper atmosphere is turned into a superheated gas that explodes out into space where the earth 's magnetic field captures some of it and shoots it back into the atmosphere stephen fuselier of the lockheed martin advanced technology center in palo alto calif said the oxygen gained 100000 times as much energy as it had before leaving the atmosphere and caused powerful electrical currents as it flowed down the magnetic field lines back to the planet when it plunges into the atmosphere these strong currents are generated he said they transform the midlatitudes from their usual calm state into kind of a maelstrom that has direct effects on our daily lives the aftermath of solar storms can include blackouts of electric power grids damaged spacecraft disrupted radio broadcasts and interruptions in satellite signals including those of the global positioning system that help pinpoint locations on the earth in solar storms the usual streams of charged particles that make up the solar wind increase in velocity and density when those streams reach the earth it is largely protected by its magnetic field which channels the flow around the planet but the magnetic field carries some of the plasma back toward the planet causing the aurora and disruptions in the ionosphere janet kozyra a researcher at the university of michigan said scientists were previously aware that the upper atmosphere worked as a heat shield to protect against solar wind but had not realized how quickly and violently it reacted until seeing recent pictures of the process the imager for magnetopause to aurora global exploration satellite or image launched in march 2000 is the first to depict the entire process from a high orbit that stretches 28500 miles into space she said
