elections for district leader among the lowliest jobs on the ladder of elective office seldom attract much attention other than from devotees of politics but a district leader race in central brooklyn is creating a stir for its potential impact on the local democratic party leadership and the budding prospects of a maverick city councilman the councilman james e davis has served as a district leader in crown heights since 2000 last week assemblyman clarence norman jr the brooklyn democratic party chairman said he would try to unseat mr davis in the september election in doing so mr norman reignited a long smoldering feud with mr davis whose council district also includes fort greene and clinton hill and who first stunned much of the political establishment in brooklyn by coming within a few hundred votes of defeating mr norman in the 1998 democratic assembly primary last year mr davis pulled off another surprise winning an open city council seat in a seven candidate race that included a longtime democratic party stalwart endorsed by the party organization should mr davis hold onto his district leader post it would be an embarrassment to mr norman who was first elected in 1982 and it would provide more ammunition to his opponents who have been unhappy with his stewardship of the county party organization and have been eager to replace him in recent weeks mr davis has said he is considering running against united states representative major r owens another democrat this fall and local party officials say they see mr norman 's decision to run against mr davis as a move to erode the councilman 's political stature and to curb any ambitions he might harbor district leaders receive no pay for serving as foot soldiers to the party organization overseeing the selection of election inspectors and helping out in the campaigns of democratic candidates mr norman said his candidacy for district leader was nothing more than a reaction to what he called mr davis 's poor job performance the present district leader has not served the community at all mr norman said he has not held any town hall meetings he should be out and about in the community helping to identify where the needs are mr davis has failed miserably in that for his part mr davis said mr norman had waged war against him he described his opponent as an out of step out of touch county leader and he chided mr norman for having led the brooklyn democratic party to endorse alan g hevesi in last year 's mayoral primary in which mr hevesi finished fourth he tends to back losing candidates mr davis said it 's increasingly embarrassing to say that you 're a democrat from kings county mr davis also said that despite being the incumbent district leader he considered himself an agent for insurgent candidates officials like mr norman he said need to have a message sent to them that their length of service does not reflect their delivery of service mr norman said he was confident he would defeat mr davis in september he said he also would be campaigning hard against his opponent in the assembly primary sandra roper who ran unsuccessfully for brooklyn district attorney last year and he said he planned to spend liberally on the assembly race having raised 100000 so far many democrats say they are upset by the battle it 's a level of politics that i personally find to be unproductive said councilwoman yvette clarke it 's part of politics to have people who are competitive and even harbor ill will but it 's unfortunate that it has to play out in front of the community
