in the world of trade policy no good deed goes unpunished the bush administration made the right call in imposing tariffs of up to 30 percent on selected steel imports from major exporting countries the expression of support from industry labor and congress has been exceeded in volume by the howls of protest from our trading partners even so this action was necessary for reasons beyond the immediate plight of the american steel industry president bush 's action falls within the world trade organization agreement that lets nations take temporary measures to keep their domestic industries competitive there is serious overcapacity in the steel industry worldwide negotiations about reducing production conducted in the organization for economic cooperation and development and elsewhere have not alleviated the current glut of steel thirty one american steel companies have gone bankrupt since 1997 and the steel industry in many nations is in jeopardy as controversial as the tariff decision is it is an effective way to jump start serious talks and can pave the way for a major consolidation of the industry worldwide the most important reason for the administration 's action has to do with our leadership in trade to move forward on a trade agenda that can open new markets and address trade distortions any administration must have credibility with congress and the american people not acting in the face of an obvious deterioration of the american steel industry would create the perception that we are unwilling to enforce our trade laws we need to stand up for legitimate interests failure to act would also be unhelpful to the prospects of trade promotion authority now pending in the senate a measure that must contain enhanced authority to help workers and communities displaced by trade pacts the european union complained formally to the wto about the tariffs yesterday and countries in other regions may do the same alleging violations of our trade obligations the case for our action is supportable and it is not certain that any challenge will prevail the need to enforce our trade laws and to address acute problems in this industry is more important than a protracted dispute at the wto in fact the imposition of the tariffs could well lead to new and productive discussions between european and american negotiators on other trade problems as well in the past invoking our trade laws has induced our trading partners to come to the table to resolve difficult disputes in 1993 the clinton administration imposed trade sanctions on the european union for discriminating against american made steam generators and heavy electrical equipment soon afterward the united states and the europeans entered into a two part agreement to end the discrimination and to jump start the uruguay round of trade talks by reducing tariffs in major manufacturing industries to zero currently the united states and the european union are fighting over the tax benefits given to american companies for their foreign sales and over the size of the penalty to be imposed on the united states for granting them other trade disputes involve the illegal moratorium the europeans have imposed on the import of products made from genetically modified plants questions of privacy in commercial transactions and the importation of beef produced with hormones it is in everyone 's interest that these issues be resolved fairly if the steel tariffs bring serious negotiations on all these matters the winners will be all those who would be helped by open markets and expanded world economic activity and that includes our european friends long after the inflated anti tariff rhetoric has faded the benefit of enforcing our trade laws will become clear mickey kantor served as secretary of commerce and united states trade representative during the clinton administration
