in colonial times homeowners used shutters to control the amount of light coming into the house curtains were less usual the standard interior shutter was a paneled piece without openings it had a central raised panel much like a cabinet door and it faced the window the other side of the shutter was flat by the second half of the 19th century louvered or venetian shutters became increasingly popular interior shutters are still a practical addition to any window besides controlling light they can add a decorative accent to a room interior shutters are easy to install and inexpensive most lumberyards and home centers carry ready made shutters of unfinished pine in a variety of standard sizes they are available with either fixed or movable louvers the sizes range from 6 to 13 inches wide and 16 to 48 inches tall these will fit most standard windows although a little trimming and shaving may be necessary for extra large windows a cabinetmaker or lumberyard that offers millwork will make shutters to specification installing shutters is not particularly difficult but it is important to measure the shutters carefully and trim them precisely or they will not hang straight you will need four shutters two shutters will be hinged together and attached to the left side jamb the other two to the right side there are eight hinges four to join the shutters together and four to mount the shutters to the window jambs measure the distance between the window jambs and divide this figure by four to find the approximate width of the the shutters you need the shutters should come up to the top of the lower sash on double hung windows they should not extend beyond the sash measure this distance to find the shutter height you need you may have to buy shutters taller than the sash height but you can trim them it is best to trim the shutters with a stationary power saw like a power miter saw a table saw or a radial arm saw because it is difficult to make accurate cuts with a hand saw trim the bottom of the shutters first but do not cut off more than three quarters of an inch if you need to trim more take the additional cut from the top next check to see if all four shutters will fit in the width of the window lay the shutters flat then tape them together temporarily the shutters will eventually be hinged together and the method you use to mount the hinges could affect the total width of the shutters mortised hinges will fit in a recesses chiseled in the edge of the shutter and will not add much to the width cutting mortises precisely takes skill however it is easier to surface mount the hinges but you 'll have allow for the thickness that the hinges will add to the total width of the four shutters an easy way to do this is by inserting eighth inch thick pieces of cardboard between each shutter before you tape them together stand the taped shutters in place on the window stool the flat horizontal piece that rests on the window sill to test the fit if the shutters are too wide you will have to plane a little wood from each to narrow them look at the gap between the shutters and the side jamb it should be about an eighth of an inch wide from top to bottom a tapered gap indicates that the window frame is not square and you will have to plane some wood from the edge of the shutter to compensate for this be sure to check the gap at both side jambs before attempting to install the shutters when the shutters are trimmed to proper height and the edges shaved to accommodate the hinges sand them lightly with 120 grit sandpaper finish them with either stain or paint use a narrow brush no wider than one inch so you can work the stain or paint between the louvers allow time for the finish to dry if you have stained the shutters you will want to apply a coat of clear varnish when the finish is dry mount the hinges use two half inch hinges to join each pair of shutters together each hinge should be secured with wood screws these are provided with the hinges drill pilot holes before driving the screws home position the hinges so the hinge pin is facing the window this will allow the shutters to fold accordion style toward the jambs use the hinges of the same size to mount the shutters to the window jambs this time the hinge pins must face in the opposite direction toward the interior and away from the window this will allow the shutters to open away from the window
