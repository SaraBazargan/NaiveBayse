he was cast in the role of a villain capable of spoiling a funny cide victory celebration few wanted the tale of funny cide to end before he was crowned racing 's 12th triple crown winner but bobby frankel was in the minority the trainer had a race to win and two reputations to restore his and his horse 's he did all three after empire maker won yesterday 's belmont stakes derailing funny cide 's triple crown bid frankel was understandably unapologetic he was even able to laugh off the smattering of boos he heard after the race from fans saying that they were actually expressing their displeasure with mayor michael r bloomberg a trophy presenter you know what i do n't feel bad right now to tell you the truth frankel said i feel great i won the race and that 's what i wanted i was thinking about the race all week and i was really really confident i did n't think i could get beat you like to be right once in a while we 're wrong so much in this business there was a lot on the line for frankel and empire maker yesterday entering the kentucky derby the horse was hailed as the sport 's next superstar and a potential triple crown winner then empire maker finished second behind funny cide delivering a rather lethargic effort the hype disappeared fizzling away as he plodded to the churchill downs finish line i really wanted to win it but more so for the horse frankel said the press they tend to get down on horses and i thought 'let 's get him back on top again if he won this race we 'd all be witness to what a great horse he is that was not necessarily an easy task while empire maker was taking a big step in the wrong direction funny cide was winning races and capturing the imagination of an adoring public he not only won the kentucky derby but also delivered a sizzling performance in winning the preakness by nine and three quarters lengths funny cide entered the belmont stakes with star status and the respect of the bettors who made him the even money favorite frankel did not start empire maker in the preakness three weeks ago it was part of a calculated plan to bring his horse into the belmont in prime condition which he knew was what it would take to defeat funny cide in hindsight frankel reasoned that he might have cost his horse the derby he grew so confident that he would win the derby the first leg of the triple crown that he began to look ahead instead of buckling down on his horse in his training frankel babied him the idea was not to push too hard so that empire maker could stay at a peak throughout the triple crown races what happened in the derby was i played it real close because i was thinking too far ahead frankel said i did n't really train him too hard with him missing a day of training because of his bruised foot and with the way i trained him that week it was too much for him to overcome they call it a do over if i could do it over again he would have won the derby with empire maker now the horse of the moment many will argue that he is better than funny cide having also beaten funny cide in the wood memorial empire maker holds a 2 to 1 margin over his rival clearly his reputation has been restored the same can be said for frankel considered one of the best trainers in the sport he had nonetheless entered the belmont with a huge hole on his record he had never won a triple crown race failing to gain a victory with 11 starters he seemed able to win just about everything else on kentucky derby day frankel won three stakes races before failing in the derby in what briefly seemed like a bad omen yesterday frankel trained horses finished one two in the 400000 manhattan handicap in the race before the belmont with his own admission that he did not do a good job preparing his horse for the derby frankel 's reputation as someone who could not deliver on the biggest days was growing having pushed all the right buttons for the belmont he has left his critics with less ammunition he will though have to live with what might have been with a few breaks a better trip in the kentucky derby and a smoother path into the race it might have been empire maker and not funny cide who vied yesterday for the triple crown you ca n't go back frankel said things happen beyond anybody 's control it was all said with a contented grin for bobby frankel the spoiler it was a very good day
