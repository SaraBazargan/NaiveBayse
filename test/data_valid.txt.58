john volpe has been following pete rose since rose 's rookie year in 1963 so he felt he had as much reason to ask as anyone mr rose began volpe a local high school basketball coach how 's it look for the hall are they moving forward rose looked up a bit startled paused then finally spoke it 's got to be worth waiting for right he said the spiked unkempt hair the cocksure grin camouflaging secrets and feelings yep it 's pete several hundred people filed into a memorabilia shop today to see rose the stubby man who still has the center of gravity of a horse trailer none of them seemed to care that rose agreed to a permanent ban from baseball after an investigation of his gambling in 1989 or that he applied for reinstatement in 1997 and has been in discussions with major league baseball over the past year they just wanted the legendary baseball player sitting behind the folding table to validate their childhoods even if it was expensive the shop is called one if by cards two if by comics and it charged 55 for rose to autograph a baseball an 8x10 photo or any flat item for a 16x20 photo like the one selling today for 25 with rose 's 4192nd hit coming off the bat or a baseball cap or a piece of equipment rose 's signature cost 75 bats and jerseys 95 if he gets reinstated into baseball and you keep hearing all these rumors the value will go up said the store owner donna rubin so this stuff is a bargain charlie hustle the commodity rose 's stock has been rising since last october when a sellout crowd at pacific bell park in san francisco began chanting hall of fame hall of fame the occasion was game 4 of the world series and rose was honored in a mastercard promotion that was marketed around the game 's greatest moments commissioner bud selig watched rose 's first appearance on a big league field in three years before tens of thousands of people essentially asking for a pardon nothing has changed selig said afterward yet the reinstatement possibility took on a new life during the winter it went like this if rose could finally admit he bet on baseball then selig would be magnanimous enough to allow him back into the game and eventually onto a hall of fame ballot it is too late to have rose qualify for the 2004 hall of fame but he may still have a shot in 2005 if selig bows to public pressure asking rose when or if he thought he might be reinstated was forbidden today the same went for asking rose innocuous questions like what did he think of the 2003 reds or would he interested in being cryogenically frozen after death rose 's agent warren greene made it clear to the assembled news media that his client would not grant any interviews i know you 're thinking 'when did pete rose not talk greene said apologetically it 's just a very sensitive time translation the less rose talks the more selig may consider his reinstatement the keepers of baseball 's flame may seem overzealously intent on barring rose from the hall of fame and keeping him out of baseball but others just want you to look at the facts john m dowd the special counsel to peter ueberroth a bartlett giamatti and fay vincent during their terms as commissioner is the man who discovered rose had made 388 bets for 852400 in the first half of the 1987 season he found that rose bet 116600 on the reds in 52 games in a letter to the new york times late last year dowd even felt selig violated major league rules when he allowed rose to appear on the field for the mastercard promotion dowd pointed out that giamatti turned down a posthumous petition from the south carolina legislature on behalf of shoeless joe jackson who was barred from baseball for life for his part in the 1919 black sox scandal it 's a one day win for bud if he brings rose back vincent said and some fans applaud but then he 's got to live with rose and defend him and justify it and that 's too big a risk so the rose argument still comes down to two camps those who feel it is called the hall of fame and not the hall of infamy for a reason and those who believe cooperstown honors baseball 's great achievers not its humanitarians but if shoeless joe jackson 's heirs worked to get his name cleared for decades rose is reliant on one soul his own one veteran hall of fame voter surmised that the best thing rose has done recently is try to avoid behavior that baseball might view as counterproductive to his reinstatement rose even turned down an invitation to be mayor charlie luken 's guest in cincinnati when the reds open their new stadium great american ball park on monday just the same as another opening day comes and goes without rose sprinting onto a pitch of green he is still there in the first row of a big red machine collage on the lower concourse of the reds new ballpark there is the likeness of rose with his hands on his knees and his beady intense eyes looking straight ahead a section of the park is named club 4192 homage to rose 's historic single on sept 11 1985 the hit that eclipsed ty cobb 's career mark one of rose 's thousands of colorful quotes i 'd walk through hell in a gasoline suit to keep playing baseball is showcased in another part of the ballpark at the collectibles store today no one asked rose if he bet on baseball they just wanted the all time hit king to smile and sign their balls bats and pictures when a woman said her birthday was the same as rose 's april 14 he was quick to remind her that that was the same day the titanic sunk and lincoln got shot have a good day rose said in the same move along cadence and unsmiling fashion rose shook hands and posed for pictures with some people the lines on his weathered face spreading with each click he shared a few words with others but he also took cellphone calls while barely acknowledging some of the people in front of him rob schwartz a high school guidance counselor from new rochelle ny asked rose to personalize his autograph but schwartz was told that is a no no in the memorabilia world at least he was n't on the phone when i got to him schwartz said rubin the store owner said i do have mixed feelings about him getting in based on the numbers and his merits he deserves to be in but if you have a certain rule it does create a problem for the rest what does it say to the rest of the players when they still let you in i kind of go back and forth on it i mean let 's face it everyone knows he bet on baseball it 's just whether or not people can deal with that
