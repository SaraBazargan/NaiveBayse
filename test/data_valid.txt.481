ray lucas preparing to replace the injured jay fiedler as the miami dolphins starting quarterback said today that he was confident the dolphins offensive schemes already in place would help him meet the challenge with fiedler expected to be out for six to eight weeks with a fractured right thumb which was injured late in sunday night 's 24 22 victory at denver lucas will try to keep the 5 1 dolphins atop the american football conference east he will get his first test sunday at home against buffalo excited it still has n't hit me yet lucas said but we 've had other guys step up and that 's what i plan to do i believe in the system i think it 's probably the best offense i 've ever been in lucas recalled fiedler 's sidling up to him in the fourth quarter on sunday and showing him a misshapen thumb only to return to the game and complete two passes to put the dolphins in position to kick a winning field goal that shows his character lucas said he 's a warrior now if i 've got to follow someone like that i think the most pressure i put on myself is not to let jay down i ca n't let this slide i owe it to jay i owe it to the guys in this locker room i see myself a lot in jay we did n't get here the easy way lucas 30 has started only nine nfl games all for bill parcells 's jets in 1999 after vinny testaverde tore his left achilles tendon and rick mirer could not produce as testaverde 's immediate backup the team went 6 3 under lucas who passed for 1678 yards and 14 touchdowns with 6 interceptions dolphins wide receiver dedric ward was a teammate during that jets season i do n't think anybody here is more confident than ray himself ward said ray 's done it before and we 're confident he can do it again ward says lucas exudes a positive attitude that knows few limits sometimes he makes the play sometimes he does n't ward said but he 's never going to let you think he ca n't make a play upon being designated to step in for fiedler lucas received a phone call from parcells who combined affection with a bit of needling parcells told lucas he was sending him a box lucas asked about the contents huggies lucas was told because fiedler was recovering from left hip surgery lucas was able to play extensively in the preseason he looked enough like a starting quarterback completing 34 of 50 passes for 3 touchdowns without an interception that there was a clamor among fans for him to replace fiedler i 'm ahead of the game right now where i would n't be if jay had been healthy lucas said i realize you ca n't put any weight on preseason stats but i was so confident out there i was actually having fun i had n't had fun in a long time so i 'm looking forward to going out there and having fun lucas is aware that the last three super bowl winners the rams with kurt warner the ravens with trent dilfer and the patriots with tom brady prevailed with a quarterback who was not starting at the beginning of training camp that he said shows we have a pretty good chance to do something lucas and fiedler who has completed 112 of 176 passes for 1289 yards 9 touchdowns and 6 interceptions are similarly mobile lucas said he believed he had a slightly stronger arm the biggest contrast is in the way they exhibit leadership lucas is far louder and more animated i 'm definitely up in your face lucas who played at rutgers said it 's just my jersey personality if a guy makes one bad play i want to keep him from making two if he 's made two mistakes do n't make four it 's more 'i need you it 's not like i 'm telling a guy he stinks and i do n't want him back in the huddle under parcells lucas began as a special teams player and that aggressive edge has stayed with him he 's got a defensive mentality playing quarterback tight end randy mcmichael said i love his attitude because it 's like mine and i ca n't wait to get out on the field with him as optimistic as the dolphins are about having no drop off from fiedler to lucas there figures to be one glaring difference on sunday lucas will most likely have to throw to ward and james mcknight because the regulars chris chambers concussion and oronde gadsden wrist appear to be out one constant remains though the the 228 pound running back ricky williams who is third in the league with 614 rushing yards if they want to worry about me that 's fantastic lucas said of the bills referring to williams he said they can worry about me all week and then when they come in sunday and get a dose of '34 down their throat that 's all going to change real quick
