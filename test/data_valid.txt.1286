to the sports editor as a rabid baseball fan i was heartened by the times 's report that sports fans experience fewer bouts of depression and alienation than nonfans it is n't just a game clues to avid rooting aug 11 but there 's a downside to being a sports fanatic that was n't mentioned let 's say you root for the mets as i do this activity is considered so lowbrow ok no brow that few people will talk about baseball even during a lull before a meeting starts when someone can always be counted on to ask so has anyone seen anything good lately if you do n't chime in when conversations turn to movies or foreign affairs you are seen as a dimwit it 's fine to talk about gladiator but just mention mike piazza and no one makes a peep i spend so much time watching ballgames and trying to figure out who should bat leadoff that i lose track of what 's happening in hollywood and china so friends and colleagues probably think i 'm not too bright which is depressing and alienating ellen karsh new york
