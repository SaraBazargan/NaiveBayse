when the world 's best golfers discuss the united states open their lowered voices project a certain reverence if not fear and because the open is generally considered the most difficult championship to win that 's the best reason the open is the world 's best golf tournament if the open were just another easy tournament on an easy course who would care the essence of the open was best described by frank tatum then the president of the united states golf association when he was asked three decades ago if the difficulty of the open embarrassed the world 's best golfers we 're not trying to embarrass them tatum said we 're trying to identify them for the first two days of this open at olympia fields south of chicago golf historians winced at all the low scores but when the wind began to blow and the greens got firmer and faster during yesterday 's third round all was well and wild at the open again as jim furyk shooting a 67 took a three stroke lead into today 's final round of the other majors the masters may have more charm and more azaleas the british open may have more links and more languages and the pga championship may have more winners never heard from again but year in and year out the united states open usually produces golf 's best theater often with golf 's best names on its marquee jack nicklaus then 22 dethroned arnold palmer in an 18 hole playoff at oakmont in 1962 the first of the golden bear 's record 18 victories in majors ben hogan won on wobbly legs in 1950 at merion only 16 months after being crushed in his auto 's head on collision with a bus in texas bobby jones won four opens in a span of seven seasons the last at interlachen in 1930 on his way to completing his unmatched grand slam tiger woods won at pebble beach in 2000 by a record 15 strokes with a record tying 72 hole total of 272 and won again at bethpage black last year if the open is golf 's ultimate test with its narrow fairways thick rough and slick greens it 's significant that three of golf 's ultimate champions nicklaus hogan and jones each won it a record sharing four times and that this era 's ultimate champion the 27 year old woods has won it twice it 's equally significant that the open is the only major that another ultimate champion sam snead did not win perhaps the most popular champion arnold palmer won the 1960 open at cherry hills with a final round 65 but he 's also remembered for having lost three open playoffs to nicklaus in 1962 to julius boros in 1963 at the country club and to billy casper in 1966 at olympic after holding a six stroke lead with six holes remaining in the final round long before america adored palmer it discovered golf at the 1913 open at which 20 year old francis ouimet shocked britain 's harry vardon and ted ray and here at olympia fields vijay singh shot a record tying 63 and tom watson at age 53 shared the first round lead with a 65 every so often the open has a surprise champion andy north won it twice in 1978 at cherry hills and in 1985 at oakland hills but won only one other pga tour event the 1977 westchester classic orville moody won just the 1969 open but each was the best golfer in those opens the exceptions that prove the rule unlike the masters which blooms with the magnolias every april at augusta national the open is golf 's movable feast about an hour 's ride south on the metra train from chicago this 103rd open barring an 18 hole playoff will conclude today in its return to olympia fields where jones lost in 1928 to johnny farrell in a 36 hole playoff next year it goes to shinnecock hills on eastern long island then to pinehurst no 2 winged foot oakmont torrey pines near san diego back to bethpage black and in 2010 probably pebble beach different courses make the open different not only from the masters but also from the weekly pga tour events often played on the same familiar courses year after year over the last 90 years the open has been won in successive years by only four golfers curtis strange in 1988 at the country club and in 1989 at oak hill hogan in 1950 at merion and in 1951 at oakland hills ralph guldah in 1937 at oakland hills and in 1938 at cherry hills and jones in 1929 at winged foot and in 1930 at interlachen the variety of open courses also makes it more difficult for the best international golfers especially those from europe over the last quarter of a century 11 masters have been won by european golfers nick faldo three times seve ballesteros bernhard langer and jose maria olazabal twice and sandy lyle and ian woosnam once but at the masters there are wide fairways and virtually no rough if you 've played augusta national often enough to learn its nuances especially on the greens you can win there with the open 's rotation of famous but unfamiliar courses even experienced golfers feel like strangers and they often play like strangers the open has n't been won by a european since tony jacklin won at hazeltine in 1970 although two south africans have won it in recent years ernie els in 1994 at oakmont and in 1997 at congressional and retief goosen in 2001 at southern hills but the story of golf in america if not in the world is the story of the united states open the best tournament in the world
