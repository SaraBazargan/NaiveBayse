louis d boccardi the president and chief executive of the associated press is retiring after 18 years as the top executive of the news cooperative a time when it expanded geographically and technologically to become the world 's most pervasive purveyor of breaking news in all media the ap 's governing board announced yesterday but the announcement left the question of a successor unanswered and the ap 's senior vice president jonathan wolman notified his surprised colleagues yesterday that he was taking himself out of the running for the job he had long been groomed for when mr boccardi who turns 66 this year retires in the summer or early fall he will leave a 562 million organization whose budget is more than double what it was when he took over in 1985 with 242 bureaus and an expanded business development office it has become a vastly more complex organization which not only provides news to thousands of member newspapers but competes with those who have expanded their own wire services and are distributing news on the internet during his service the cooperative created aptn a video news service that now provides material to more than 350 broadcast outlets worldwide in addition the service created a multimedia internet site called the wire as competition for new business increased with the rival reuters making a strong push to sell news to internet sites mr boccardi persuaded his reluctant membership to do the same the ap 's 3700 member staff provides print video and online news not just to 1700 daily weekly and college newspapers and 5000 radio and television broadcast outlets but also 350 international broadcasters walter r mears mr boccardi 's longtime colleague who was executive editor then vice president and senior columnist of the wire service before he retired said yesterday in part because of the communications explosion and the technology explosion what was once primarily a personnel and news business very labor intensive became much more complex we had to have a level of capital investment that could n't be seen in the days of slow speed printer which you fixed with a monkey wrench and screw driver mr boccardi spent his entire career as a newspaperman based in new york before he joined the wire service in 1967 as an editor as he rose to the top executive job he continued a tradition of news trained top executives that stretched back nearly 40 years including the years under keith fuller and wes gallagher with mr wolman gone from the succession picture it is unclear if the next president will come from the news or the business side several news executives at the ap said that mr wolman 's announcement took them by surprise burl osborne the chairman of the cooperative 's governing board said yesterday we were in a transition process and it had n't been completed so now we move on we have a little more information than we had before and we keep going asked if he would consider outsiders or business side executives within the organization he said we 're looking everywhere i 'm not going to put any constraints on what we look at he added but i will say that news is what we do and the most important thing we do so it will be a prime concern as we go forward three other board members reached yesterday refused to comment on the developments mr wolman said in an interview i took a measure of everything i wanted to do and decided to put my energy into editorial where i 've spent all my time here it 's just a fabulous fascinating company and doing so much now he added so it 's true that a year ago i came up into the president 's office and it gave me a very good look at everything we do but he added it turned out i wanted to focus on editorial even after intense days of business activity mr boccardi still paid close attention to the ap 's articles as mr mears said he used to take a briefcase full of ap copy the high speed wire and after a full day 's work on business he 'd read it on the train the next day you would then see pieces of copy that he had re edited or marked up
