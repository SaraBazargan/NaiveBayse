as many as 700000 new jersey residents are drinking water that is contaminated with dangerously high levels of arsenic according to a coalition of environmentalists that is trying to force the state to tighten acceptable levels of the substance a known carcinogen based on a recent study documenting the perils of prolonged arsenic consumption the new jersey environmental federation said yesterday that it would sue the state department of environmental protection for ignoring laws meant to reduce new jersey 's cancer rate the amount of arsenic that new jersey residents are being exposed to is ridiculous said david pringle the group 's campaign director not only is it not acceptable but it 's illegal although arsenic is a byproduct of industry and agriculture in new jersey it is more often a naturally occurring element drawn from the earth 's crust mr pringle said that development in the state had overtaxed underground aquifers and brought more arsenic to the surface long term exposure to arsenic has been shown to cause skin bladder and lung cancer and it may cause kidney and liver cancer researchers also believe it harms the nervous system blood vessels and the heart under state law drinking water contamination is acceptable as long as the risk of cancer from the contaminant does not exceed one in a million by the standards now used by the state however residents who drink tap water have a one in 100 chance of getting cancer from arsenic contamination according to the national academy of sciences state officials said that those estimates were overblown and that it would be technologically unfeasible to meet the goals in the lawsuit to say that hundreds of thousands of people are being poisoned by arsenic is a hysterical statement said peter page a spokesman for the state department of environmental protection it 's taken completely out of context what no one disputes is that the nation 's standard for arsenic exposure is woefully obsolete it was established in 1942 when arsenic 's degree of toxicity was not known even the water industry agrees that the current standard 50 parts per billion is far too high but an agreement to revise the figure has been mired in politics since 1974 when congress first asked environmental officials for a new standard while many clean water advocates are seeking a standard of three parts per billion lobbyists for water suppliers developers and manufacturers have been seeking a less stringent standard in an effort to come up with new regulations congress commissioned the national academy of sciences to determine the effects of arsenic on humans last year the findings were released documenting a wide range of health problems related to moderate arsenic exposure i do n't think anyone doubts that the current standard is way too high and that it increases the risk of cancer said dr robert goyer a pathologist from north carolina who led the panel 's committee on toxicology although the environmental protection agency used those findings to establish a new range of standards the recommendations have languished at the office of management and budget for months last week the natural resources defense council said it would file a lawsuit against the agency if the new regulations were not issued within 60 days using research it obtained from the epa the group estimated that at least 34 million americans drink tap water that contains unacceptable levels of arsenic the new jersey environmental federation used the same data for their calculations chuck fox the agency 's assistant administrator for water said the new regulations would be issued by june he said that he could not predict the final outcome but that the standard would be far more stringent than 50 parts per billion we know we need to be much more protective of the public 's health he said the national resources defense council and the new jersey environmental federation are both pushing for a standard of three parts per billion or less which would statistically reduce the risk of getting cancer from arsenic in drinking water to one in 1700 in new jersey mr pringle acknowledged that it was unrealistic to expect to reduce the risk of cancer to one in a million in compliance with the state regulations to get to that level of safety he said arsenic would have to be kept below one half part per billion and most widely available testing methods can not detect arsenic at that level he said that bringing the state 's water to a level of three parts per billion through filtration would cost the average household 5 to 15 a month water industry executives said a goal of 3 parts per billion would be far too expensive to achieve and they would like to see the regulations set between 5 and 10 parts per billion edward mullen vice president of the elizabethtown water company which serves one million people in northern new jersey said he worried that politics might influence the final outcome the public deserves a number they can have confidence is based on science not misrepresentation he said you best believe the water suppliers will be looking very carefully at those numbers
