to the editor re nurse patient ratio linked to death rate news article oct 23 as a nurse i am not at all surprised by this study first registered nurses develop a sixth sense through education and experience that helps them assess patients for complications before they become life threatening when nurses are replaced by less educated nurse substitutes who are not capable of making timely assessments the patients wellbeing will surely be compromised in addition cuts in hospital budgets and insurance reimbursements have led to increased patient load at a time when there is a severe nursing shortage most nurses do not go into nursing for monetary reasons but for altruistic reasons many of us have chosen to pull out rather than to jeopardize our patients lives taking into consideration that the nurse who has the largest patient load usually has the less critical patients makes this study even more disturbing i hope that this report will be an eye opening experience to hospital administrators and insurance companies kathy hoffstadter thal demarest nj oct 23 2002
