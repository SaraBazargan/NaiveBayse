the taxi driver picked up a fare at the airport and uttered this disjointed greeting nice day is n't it our football team is lousy with little encouragement the cabbie milo wiley expanded his analysis of the syracuse university football team which in one season has gone from one of the best in the country to one of the worst no experience too many freshmen he said i 've been going to their games for more than 30 years i went when ben schwartzwalder was coach and they played outdoors in archbold stadium and we froze on those concrete seats i 've got season tickets and i go now in that nice dome but the team is n't the same paul pasqualoni the syracuse coach is as baffled as anyone last season his team finished 10 3 ending with a 26 3 victory over kansas state in the insightcom bowl that glorious season was a surprise so is this season 's 1 6 record which leaves syracuse tied with rutgers for the worst record in the big east conference syracuse and rutgers who meet here saturday in the carrier dome are also 0 3 in conference games syracuse is not the only team that has struggled unexpectedly this season nebraska is 5 3 after going 11 2 and playing in the national championship game last season and florida is 5 3 after going 10 2 and winning the orange bowl but pasqualoni has never had a losing season here in five seasons at western connecticut and in his 12 seasons here his coaching record is 126 62 1 only 10 other active head coaches have won more games with that success pasqualoni might be expected to have answers but he said today that he could not single out one or two reasons for this year 's crash it 's a lot of things he said inexperience with only 11 seniors on the 80 man squad no he said we 've had small senior classes in the past poor recruiting no he said we 're doing very good there poor conditioning which might explain fourth quarter nose dives in losses to brigham young north carolina and temple and in a triple overtime loss to auburn no he said you need to play well and it does n't matter if you have problems in the first quarter or the fourth we 've had both then what is the problem pasqualoni started with execution a coach 's way of saying that their guys are doing things better than our guys are it 's players who allow you to win and lose he said it 's always a turnover battle you play good defense and it allows you to be a good team the turnovers have come too frequently the defense is shaky and the numbers say syracuse is a bad team of the 117 teams in division i a syracuse ranks 110th in defense yielding 4773 yards a game the offense once powered by the running of jim brown ernie davis floyd little larry csonka and joe morris ranks 92nd gaining 3471 yards a game the 19 giveaways are tied for 93rd worst in the nation r j anderson has not distinguished himself at quarterback and although anderson 's bruised passing shoulder is better troy nunes will start this week syracuse has lost by more than 20 points in three games by 27 points against west virginia by 24 against pittsburgh and by 21 against brigham young the orangemen 's only victory was against rhode island a i aa team after the rutgers game syracuse plays central florida before taking on some of the top teams in the big east miami and virginia tech which are unbeaten and boston college which has top 25 potential the players struggle with the unaccustomed losing offensive guard erik kaloyanides a 6 foot 4 inch 310 pound senior says everyone he meets seeks an explanation after a home game he said i go to dinner with my family and my dad keeps asking 'what happened here what happened there and i keep saying 'dad i do n't know i 'm at a loss for words we work so hard the last two weeks the tuesday and wednesday practices were maybe the best of the year but it did n't show on saturday instead syracuse lost at temple 17 16 and at west virginia 34 7 but kaloyanides said he was not discouraged frustrated maybe he said we 're still trying to change things we 're still coming to work with our heads high we ca n't hang our heads pasqualoni 's message to his players is to keep working hard when you face the adversity we faced this year there 's no ready solution he said you do n't do anything differently you have the same routine every week you stick with the things you know have worked for you you do n't start looking for band aids unless syracuse disposes of rutgers and at least scares some of those big east powers it will need a lot more than bandages to get well
