i have always taken maps on trips but now i use them just for backup and to give me an idea of the territory since installing a navigation system in my car i just get in enter a destination and let it tell me how to go unlike maps a navigation system knows where i am and i do n't need to pull off the road to consult it instead it guides me as i drive warning me aloud about each coming turn and recalculating the route in a twinkling if i miss the turn or ignore the directions the systems are built into most luxury cars now and are quickly becoming optional on less expensive models it is even possible to build a navigation system into the car you already own as i did or get a portable one you can take from car to car navigation systems determine a vehicle 's whereabouts through global positioning system signals from satellites the system then compares that information with the map data stored in its onboard computer when the driver enters a destination the navigation system uses the map data to calculate a route and then directs the driver usually in two ways by plotting the vehicle 's position and direction on an lcd map display on the dashboard and by offering voice commands as the driver moves along a route the voice commands which are piped through the vehicle 's stereo speakers warn of turns and lane changes well ahead of time with my nav system i feel more free to go new places without fear of arriving late and to explore side roads without worrying about getting lost i have always liked to use back roads but now it 's more fun because i know the system will keep me out of dead ends and tell me where to find gas when i need it it can also tell me where to find food although the vietnamese place listed in the system may be a mexican place by now i feel a little safer too i 'm not distracted by peering around to see where to go next and i no longer make last minute turns that scare the drivers behind me i know ahead of time where the turn is and if i miss it the system will get me back on track even on local trips the systems help it 's wonderful for car pooling when you 're going to a kid 's house where you have n't been before said irene levine a university professor in westchester county kids often do n't give good directions but they know their addresses and that 's all i need and even around my own neighborhood i sometimes learn simpler more direct routes i did not know existed although navigation systems are long on knowledge they are often short on wisdom they are n't as smart as local residents about say turning early to avoid a traffic light and their bias toward major roads will sometimes cause them to plot a route on a toll road to save two minutes on a half hour trip or to choose the most heavily trafficked route at rush hour and even their road knowledge is n't complete the systems i have tried know every town and highway in the united states or canada but they can not find every street in places far from metropolitan areas the systems have individual quirks too mine for example keeps telling me turn right or turn left on parkways where a human co pilot would probably say follow the road as it curves and do n't go straight ahead into that exit and several systems including mine can not find addresses on numbered highways like route 1 or route 22 although they recognize those roads when i 'm on them i have learned to sense when the system is trying to take me out of my way to get me onto a parkway or interstate i do n't really need on local drives that 's easy in strange territory i sometimes pull over and read the route list off the screen to see if i want to follow the system 's advice or ignore it i have also learned to shut the system off on long trips when i 'm near home where its advice unneeded sounds like nagging outbound i enter my destination but do n't activate it until i 'm in unfamiliar territory inbound i use it until i recognize where i am my nav system built into a blaupunkt stereo has no map display but friends whose systems have map displays sometimes use them without entering a destination garland cox a retiree in tucson said you can see where the next turns are coming where the exits are on interstates it even tells you where the rest stops are mrs levine uses her system that way too it 's nice to see where you are and what 's around she said for all the effort and anxiety navigation systems save you long trips can still be tiring at that point mrs levine said it 's wonderful to enter 'home and put yourself on autopilot back seat drivers 'no i 'm not driving too fast here are some common questions and answers about vehicle navigation systems are navigation systems available for all cars yes many luxury vehicles offer systems as standard equipment or bundled with other options you can buy a portable unit available from companies like garmin magellan and visteon or install an aftermarket unit from companies like alpine blaupunkt and pioneer built in systems tend to be more accurate because they can access the vehicle 's instruments to determine information like speed if you have a pocket or laptop computer you can also get add on global positioning system receivers and mapping software but then you have to worry about keeping the equipment in place during bumpy rides how much do they cost because most factory installed systems are included in the cost of the car or an accessory package it can be difficult to determine their cost aftermarket systems run from about 1000 to 2500 not including installation portables are 400 to 1700 pocket computer systems cost 200 to 400 how accurate are the systems newer systems can identify the vehicle 's position to within about 25 to 50 feet how are the maps stored map information is stored on cd rom 's or dvd 's which are usually loaded into the computer a single dvd can map the entire united states a cd rom can cover several states so you may need to carry several discs with you during longer trips because roads change the discs need to be replaced every few years which is preferable voice or map directions some systems use just one or the other but most offer some combination keep in mind that voice output can guide drivers without requiring them to look away from the road
