sure being a republican lawmaker in the democrat dominated state assembly is something akin to being a bottle of near beer at a frat party still roy mcdonald thought he could do well by the 100th district which includes the town of wilton ny near saratoga springs where he had been supervisor for 23 years at the least the office would expand mr mcdonald 's ability to pump up the local economy voters apparently liked the idea on feb 12 in a special election mr mcdonald won with more than 70 percent of the vote two days later he was minding his own political business attending a valentine 's day dinner for the elderly at elks lodge 161 when he got a call the legislature had released its redistricting plan the 100th district was gone butchered neatly and parceled among four assembly seats including one with no incumbent and in time for the next election in november when mr mcdonald is up for re election he may have to run against a fellow republican assembly member welcome to albany it is no secret that in new york state redistricting is a decennial sacrificial festival of brute political muscle and lines drawn in extra fine point this time around was no exception the new district lines which are not final have been scrutinized as if they were tea leaves and all manner of intent has been divined from mischief making to revenge to blind ambition it is impossible to tell how calculated the wiggles of any one border may be but where some see nothing more than the predictable machinery of albany in which the majority grinds mercilessly away at the minority the 100th district sees a strategic assault in mr mcdonald 's case the new lines created a nearby republican district with no incumbent through the use of a cul de sac mr mcdonald has been lumped into a district with elizabeth o'c little a fellow republican and seven year veteran of the assembly under the plan 24 republicans but only 2 democrats would run against incumbents which the democrats say is because most population losses occurred in republican territory the current 100th district includes a good chunk of saratoga and all of washington county where mr mcdonald 's family has farmed for generations the new mcdonald little district also includes all of washington county all that is except for easton and cambridge where mr mcdonald 's relatives live coincidental or not and democrats say it is that is enough to make mr mcdonald an investment banker and son of a steelworker who was born in troy ny practically a martyr he will be an outspoken official for upstate new york and that 's the last thing sheldon silver wants to see said assemblyman james n tedisco a republican referring to the assembly speaker who controls the redistricting process in that house while the plan is supposed to keep counties as intact as possible saratoga county has been divided among six districts county officials complain that the plan dilutes the political voice of one of the few bright spots in upstate 's lagging economy while giving new york city more districts than its population warrants the senate plan has been criticized for being overly generous to upstate districts but nothing that was done to saratoga county was done on purpose the democrats say there was n't any particular purpose to the plan in that area other than to balance population requirements said assemblyman william l parment the democratic co chairman of the redistricting committee when we drew the plan i did n't know who roy mcdonald was it was monday the day mr mcdonald took his oath of office and mr parment sat in the rear foyer of the assembly chamber where passing lawmakers stopped to rib him about changes to their districts what are you trying to do make me learn how to speak spanish or something one said mr parment who is from upstate said you see it 's not just republicans who are unhappy i 've got one democratic member who is n't speaking to me true even if the new lines do not force a lawmaker to face an incumbent they can make life difficult and for many democrats they have in rochester joseph e robach was involuntarily divorced from the area where he grew up and attends church in queens brian m mclaughlin 's new district shoved over to make way for an asian american district has only about 15 percent of his former territory and nettie mayersohn also in queens met a similar fate critics point out that many of the democrats who are disadvantaged under the plan were instrumental in an attempted coup against mr silver in 2000 but assemblyman ivan c lafayette who was promoted after the coup attempt has also lost more than half of his district in queens north country politicians say they will look to albany 's most powerful republicans the senate majority leader joseph l bruno and gov george e pataki to restore their lines but the two previous governors have not intervened in the redistricting process for state lawmakers and it remains to be seen what mr pataki will do at the swearing in mr bruno congratulated mr mcdonald and his three fellow new assemblymen all of whom are republicans and told them how much they were needed in albany but when questioned by a reporter mr bruno stopped short of saying that redrawing the north country would be one of his priorities there 'll be a lot of input he said with a bright smile i 'm sure the speaker will be as fair and equitable as he can
