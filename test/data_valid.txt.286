audiences can expect to be inundated with bach in this 250th year since his death but the ars antiqua period instrument ensemble is taking an unusual detour to gain a greater understanding of bach 's genius as a young composer mark kramer the viola da gambist who directs the ensemble said bach produced seemingly from nowhere church cantatas and instrumental works so evolved that they are virtually indistinguishable from works he composed some 40 years later he continued we know he had been inspired by vivaldi buxtehude and others but the true wellspring of johann sebastian 's talent came from within his own family to prove the point mr kramer has chosen cantatas and motets by three of bach 's ancestors georg christoph johann christoph and johann michael bach with performances today at 4 pm in the church of st mary the virgin in chappaqua all of these works are drawn from the 'bach family archive a collection of compositions kept in the bach family for several generations mr kramer
