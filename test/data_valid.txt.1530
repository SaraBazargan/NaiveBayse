who can resist fountains their bubbling soothes the ears their windborne spray cools the skin miniature oases they renew the spirits of heat struck new yorkers many of the city 's fountains are famous prometheus at rockefeller center the bethesda fountain in central park the unisphere in queens but what of others too numerous to count here is a selection of some lesser known treasures fountains flow in the concrete canyons of midtown many in or near office buildings or in so called pocket parks built in return for the zoning concessions that used to be granted to the developers of the tallest towers most are unremarkable there are famous exceptions like the wall of water in paley park on east 53rd street near fifth avenue and a little gem off the lobby of heron tower a slim office building at 70 east 55th street between madison and fifth avenues the heron tower fountain is a jet of water no more than a few inches high but it is set off by six parallel columns three on a side rising up and angling inward on a base that slopes up and back like a raised triangle in a textbook exercise in perspective the back columns are also shorter than the middle columns which in turn are shorter than those in front thus making this little fountain look both big and distant the effect is zenlike serene and calming in 1904 the general slocum an excursion steamer burned and sank at the north end of the east river killing 1000 of the 1300 people aboard most of them women and children of german descent and many of them parishioners of st mark 's evangelical lutheran church at sixth street and second avenue two years later members of the sympathy society of german ladies dedicated the slocum memorial fountain in their honor at the northern end of tompkins square park in the neighborhood where many of the victims lived it is shaped like a gravestone a nine foot high slab of pink marble with water trickling from a lion 's head spout the fountain was restored a decade ago and is now at the entrance to a playground previously it had fallen victim to the same hard times as the park which became a tent city of squatters until they were evicted and the park closed for a few months in 1991 people used to try to bathe in it a park worker said we used to have to chase them off the monarch of the waves can be found on the north lawn of the snug harbor cultural center the historic restoration on staten island in front of the randall memorial church and the music hall there a landlocked king neptune holds court in a beautiful 1893 zinc fountain bearing his name he sits in the middle astride a shell held aloft by sea monsters his trident raised jets of water spurt from the fountain 's center and from bouquets of metal calla lilies to its sides visitors to snug harbor stop and watch sitting on benches surrounding the scene while workmen eat their lunches it is quiet noisy new york and its busy harbor only 200 feet away beyond richmond terrace might just as well be on mars or at least at the other end of his majesty 's sea the rhine maiden surveys her domain proudly now sitting atop the marble heinrich heine fountain in joyce kilmer park near the grand concourse and across 161st street from the bronx county courthouse and yankee stadium but things have not always been so good for lorelei whose song was said to lure sailors to their death commissioned in 1888 by empress elizabeth of austria to honor heine the poet who wrote die lorelei the fountain was intended to be given to the german city of dusseldorf but german nationalists were not enthusiastic about honoring a jewish socialist and refused the gift so a group of german americans took it instead erecting it in the bronx in 1899 years of neglect and vandalism took their toll some mermaids at lorelei 's feet were decapitated the water was turned off and garbage filled the fountain basin in 1997 a 12 million restoration project was announced the fountain was repaired and last summer rededicated but it is still not flowing that will happen once joyce kilmer park is renovated by the end of the year what is probably the city 's newest fountain is literally the centerpiece of city hall park which was renovated last year but it is meant to look old the four plume victorian fountain with huge gas lamps burning at its corners is said to evoke a predecessor that stood at the site between 1871 and 1920 some architecture and design critics and have been less than kind to the park renovation and the fountain which replaced another donated in the 1970 's by the philanthropist george delacorte they say they offer ersatz history and too many fences and restrictions on public access but on a recent warm day passers by including many foreign tourists did not seem to mind the water feels good said one man his hand near the spray cool
