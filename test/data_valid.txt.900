early in the reagan administration i spent a year on the staff of the council of economic advisers while there i got a disillusioning look at how economic policy is really made but one favorable surprise was how seriously us officials took our international trade agreements the reagan administration despite its free trade rhetoric was quite willing to protect industries for political gain the most notable example was the voluntary restraint on japanese car exports still it was a firm rule that trade interventions had to be gatt legal that is they could n't violate the general agreement on tariffs and trade the gatt has since been incorporated into the rules of the world trade organization and that scrupulousness continued up to the end of the clinton years everyone understood that there were certain things that you did n't do no matter how convenient they might be in terms of short term political advantage in those days in other words responsible people ran our international economic policy when the bush administration imposed steep tariffs on imported steel it became clear that this is no longer true in sheer economic terms the steel tariff is not that big a deal but it demonstrates an unprecedented contempt for international rules the immediate threat is that other nations will strike back the european union has threatened retaliatory tariffs and earlier this week japan brazil south korea and china said they would follow suit mr bush really has unified the world at least on this issue but as a wise trade expert once told me the big danger when the us flouts the rules is n't retaliation it 's emulation if we do n't honor trade agreements who will why do we need trade agreements anyway the costs that tariffs and import quotas impose on domestic consumers almost always exceed the gains they provide to domestic producers nonetheless if we did n't have trade agreements protectionism would usually win consumers do n't realize that they are hurt by steel tariffs or sugar quotas but the steel and sugar industries know exactly what they 're getting the reason we manage to have fairly free trade is that the world under us leadership has evolved a system that pits the self interest of exporters against the power of industries that would prefer not to compete with imports each country agrees to accept the exports of other countries in return for access to their markets in the language of trade negotiations the parties to such an agreement make concessions but the real purpose of those concessions is to protect ourselves from our own bad instincts the system depends on the proposition that a deal is a deal a country that has say agreed to allow imports of steel wo n't renege on its promise simply because the domestic political winds have shifted trade agreements do include safeguards special circumstances under which temporary tariffs are permitted but the conditions under which you can do that are fairly restrictive and the steel industry clearly did n't meet those conditions in particular steel imports have lately been declining not rising when the bush administration nonetheless decided to give the steel industry the protection it wanted it was in effect saying as it has in so many other areas that the rules do n't apply to yours truly the administration insists that it is simply standing up for us interests robert zoellick the trade representative who used to be a genuine free trader but these days sounds like a broken man declared that uncle sam is not going to be uncle sap for these people but if you believe that this is about the national interest i 've got a terrorist threat against the brooklyn bridge you might be willing to buy what it 's really about of course is raw short sighted politics the same politics that has led the administration to revoke crucial trade access to caribbean nations with devastating prospective effects on their economies to help out a single south carolina congressman in the case of steel karl rove weighed three electoral votes in west virginia against the world trading system built up over 60 years and the answer was apparently obvious mr bush will soon have trade promotion authority what we used to call fast track which he says he needs in order to negotiate new trade agreements but what good are new agreements if we wo n't honor the old ones e mail krugman nytimescom
