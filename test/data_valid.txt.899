in establishing the population of the united states at 281421906 the census bureau discharged an obligation yesterday that it has met every 10 years since 1790 but the bureau 's numbers are almost certain to inspire some political battles the 2000 census reconfirmed the longstanding population shift from the northeast and midwest to the south and west with republicans in congress the likely beneficiaries now there will be fights in the states over congressional redistricting there will also be fights in the states and in washington over whether these raw numbers or a more scientifically based sampling should help determine aid formulas and congressional boundary lines within the states there was one significant surprise in the numbers released yesterday the 2000 census found that the american population had jumped 132 percent since 1990 higher than many analysts expected it could be that the population is growing faster than some thought but kenneth prewitt the census director speculated that the bureau had done a more thorough job of counting it will be up to george w bush to decide whether to allow the census bureau to proceed next year with a scientific study of possible undercounts many uncounted citizens are believed to live in poorer more urban areas mr bush should not kill such a study as some republicans want to do so would be to echo his campaign 's efforts to suppress the counting of votes in florida after the election the supreme court has ruled that only the raw numbers can determine the apportionment of congressional seats among the states accordingly the numbers released yesterday are definitive in their determination that 8 states gained congressional seats while 10 lost seats new york and pennsylvania were the two biggest losers each losing two seats arizona florida georgia and texas each gained two on the surface these trends would seem to help the republicans most of the states gaining seats were carried by mr bush while most of those losing seats were carried by vice president al gore had mr bush run under the new census his electoral vote margin would have been greater but he would still have needed florida it is far from clear however that the republicans will actually gain all the seats that have shifted to states in the republican presidential column many of these states have democratic legislatures or governors who are likely to try to draw lines in a way that ensures some new seats for democrats to compensate for losses elsewhere north carolina and georgia could add democratic as well as republican seats democrats might also win a new seat or two in republican controlled arizona and florida on the other hand the fastest growing suburbs where new districts are likely to be created are also the most reliably republican the supreme court has left open the question of whether the states can use statistical sampling techniques to make their own reapportionment barring action by mr bush the census bureau plans to offer two sets of numbers next year one raw and one adjusted by statistical sampling states that use the second adjusted sampling may give greater representation to poorer more urban or minority dominated areas that are usually believed to be undercounted but there are sure to be legal challenges to any use of sampling yesterday 's numbers dealt only with increases and decreases in population next year the census bureau will release reams of information about demographic changes but the new numbers provide an important snapshot likely to change the american political landscape in the coming decade
