each morning when the skies above the sea are still shot with pink brian coen rises dresses and hurries out to keep his date with the tide by 8 am his boats are ready by the dock in harvey cedars when tourists start showing up mr coen a 24 year old with red hair and a surfer 's muscular build greets them all they are a mixed bunch parents with children adventurous seniors and quiet loners hoping for a glimpse of the watery world between the mainland and long beach island a quick lecture a paddling lesson and they 're off for the next two hours mr coen will lead his charges in and around a pair of islands in the salt marshes of edwin b forsythe national wildlife refuge the customers have paid mr coen 's employers either harvey cedars marina in harvey cedars or island surf and sail in brant beach about 45 each for the privilege of piloting ocean kayaks around the waters south of barnegat bay the kayak one of the most ancient sea vessels was originally designed as a hunting boat that pursued sea mammals waterfowl and caribou traipsing across the tundra covered with a tight shell of animal skin the kayak was shielded from waves mist and the harsh breath of the sea propelled by a double bladed paddle in the hands of athletes kayaks zip through whitewater and sea currents at blistering speeds but at the jersey shore these elegant vessels are most often a vacationer 's plaything a handy tool for visiting worlds one seldom sees the closer that world the more startling it is to behold take the hottest trip in clinton for example it winds 12 miles down the south branch of the raritan past the town 's oft photographed red mill the sleepy village of stanton station and finally after eight small bridges flemington not exactly lewis clark territory right and yet said peter pender a boating outfitter who has run clinton canoe and kayak with his wife dena and three sons for the last 13 years it 's a country river you do n't see houses you 're not floating past peoples backyards it 's all trees and bridges for 12 miles what you do see are turtles ducks and geese there are deer herons and egrets and there is also a palpable sense of what life might have been like in hunterdon county in the days before reliable ground transportation even today river travel is inherently unpredictable as mr pender knows first hand this is moving water he said it 's not like a swimming pool a tree may have come down the night before a 60 foot tall one came down just this week so we 're constantly scanning the water i had to have a tree removed because mr and mrs beaver started in on it boaters can also take a seven mile trip or just paddle in the calm flat water alongside the boathouse flat water paddling costs only 20 a boat up to two hours on weekends the penders even roll out a model a truck waterfront and sell barbecued ribs hot dogs and sausage sandwiches oh yes said mr pender it 's a good time down by the river but it 's not without rules no alcohol all boaters must be able to swim no children under 6 are permitted in boats and there must be 2 to 1 ratio of children to adults a rule that has nipped many a birthday party plan in the bud i always stress that we 're into family boating he said we 're not going to give you rapids or danger down at the shore mr coen is constantly sitting before his computer checking weather reports kayaks are the preferred method of travel in the salt marshes narrow in profile soundless except for the gentle splash of water they offer an unparalleled method of approaching wildlife but the wide hulled boats that tour companies rent novices can be tough to paddle in windy conditions that 's why i like to get people out early said mr coen who is in his third summer as a marsh guide eight am that 's before the wind kicks up or other boats come out in the time before the hordes of beachgoers arrive and drive the island 's wildlife for cover quiet kayakers can spot long beaked wading bird usually herons great egrets and glossy ibises fishing for their breakfasts and ospreys wheeling overhead in past summers said bill stuempfig a self taught naturalist boat captain and owner of bay cats kayaks and catamarans in ocean city visitors could spot lots of diamondback terrapins but the species has diminished in recent years because so many terrapins are killed crossing roads to lay their eggs another change awaiting you in the marshes pelicans commonplace in the south they were seldom found in new jersey people say it 's because of global warming said mr coen but no one knows really we used to see them in august the warmest time of the year but now we 're seeing them in may and june and they stick around until october mr stuempfig who runs tours farther south along the shore near the great egg river harbor estuary said 'the best part of the kayak is that you are low enough to the water that birds do not care that you 're there with so much to see human visitors who have a good time on rental trips are likely to want to buy their own boats one could argue it 's the chief reason rental outfits exist get hooked and you just might join the club we do n't make a lot of money on rentals said mr pender in clinton there 's a lot of maintenance involved but we hear all the time 'hey that was neat let 's buy a boat traditionally the boat offered is a deck kayak with a hull completely enclosed except for a small hole in top paddlers stow gear in the hull and slip into the hole with their legs stretched out before them it makes for a snug ride but many newcomers feel uncomfortable maneuvering in such close quarters a newer alternative the sit on top is open to the air built of durable plastic and floats in case the boat flips a one person kayak stretches about 11 to 13 feet long weighs 35 to 40 pounds and costs between 400 to 600 a double or tandem kayak 12 to 15 feet weighs 55 to 75 pounds and costs about 900 size and weight can matter because some excursions call for lifting as well as paddling mr pender 's river trip down the raritan for example requires one portage at some point along the river boaters need to get out and haul their vessel over a 3 by 1 foot cement wall blocking their path and people heading to the beach can expect a workout hoisting their new toy on and off the top of their cars but this is small price to pay it 's very mellow being out on the water said mr coen who bids adieu to the jersey shore each fall and heads for costa rica to surf many times you can do the whole tour and see no people and mr stuempfig who at 47 has spent a lifetime near or on the water first in florida and now at the shore searches for analogies to describe the kayak 's graceful glide through water it 's really relaxing he said it 's not too strenuous it 's like swimming slowly and the way we do it we take advantage of the tides so you 're going up with the tide and you ride the tide back so there 's some floating time you ca n't believe how peaceful it is a mile from the boardwalk
