not long ago i received a letter from the camden city municipal court apparently i had neglected to pay a ticket for parking illegally at 500 benson street in camden the only problem was that i 'd never been in camden as the notice explained i had two options pay the 35 fine or plead not guilty the problem with pleading not guilty was that you had to do it in person and since camden is a two hour drive from my house i searched for a third and more palatable option to whom it may concern i wrote while it is true that my license plate number is nj yc600c and that my driver 's license is as you printed i have n't received any parking tickets in the last six months and certainly not for parking illegally in camden a city i have never visited please check your error i did n't give the matter any more thought until another letter from the court arrived with no acknowledgment of my previous letter it repeated the offense and again cited my options pay up or show up insanity i once read is repeating the same action and expecting different results nonetheless when i received the second notice from the court i sent a duplicate of my original letter with a handwritten postscript urging them to read the enclosed and acknowledge receipt of it if you have not surrendered your current new jersey driver license to the above court the division of motor vehicles wrote me a few months later you must surrender it to motor vehicle services immediately the letter dated march 14 arrived in my mail box on march 30 presumably i 'd been driving illegally for two weeks at that point to have my driving privileges restored i needed not only to pay the ticket but also to send the canceled check to the nearest motor vehicles office along with a 50 penalty the catch 22 was that to have my driving privileges restored in less time than it would take for everyone to receive their various checks by mail and then respond to me i 'd have to drive to the nearest motor vehicles office in my case in wayne which of course i could n't legally do since i no longer had a license ask officials at the motor vehicle agency how many people get trapped in this nightmare and they will tell you calmly of course first that they do n't know and second that it 's really none of their business we do know that it happens but we do n't have the means or the authority to challenge it said a spokesman derrick stokes if we get information that a suspension has been ordered unfairly and the court wants that suspension revoked then we correct the error but the division does n't act unilaterally mr stokes said we do n't tell the courts what to do they take an action and we ca n't reverse it as for numbers there 's no way to know how many people are erroneously issued parking tickets he said we just get the notification when the cases are resolved obviously the most cases we hear about are from major cities if the city of newark for example issues a million parking tickets a year and half a percent of them are wrong that 's a lot since a day and a half of dealing with the bureaucracy by telephone does n't qualify as tragedy my story i suppose has a happy ending after 48 hours of death by voice mail i was eventually rescued by roberta black a principal clerk typist who was wise enough to ask the crucial question what kind of car do you drive a toyota i answered an encouraging sign ms black said this ticket was issued to a ford even then the error might have taken days to correct the judge had to rescind the order and then convey that order to the motor vehicle agency by way of its special hot line which is sometimes only lukewarm but thanks to ms black 's intercession i was back on the road legally the next day and without having to pay the normal 50 for having my license restored not everyone is so lucky mr stokes told me about a letter he received just last month from a distraught woman whose son had not been able to get a driver 's license because of unpaid parking tickets in new york city newark elizabeth east orange and new brunswick but the son was living in north carolina at the time that the tickets were issued a fact he was later able to prove by providing the courts with his pay stubs that the tickets were issued to three different cars with three different license plates also perplexed his mother because as she wrote to various agencies although ernest has a new jersey driver 's license he has never owned a vehicle he has never had any license plates registered in his name the mother janet cooke of east orange added the thought that my son could be arrested for something he is not responsible for is very heart wrenching i currently work only part time and am unable to help him pay for these tickets the case though still unresolved is being reviewed by investigators as one of stolen identity and that problem is an even greater headache for the motor vehicle agency fortunately help is on the way on april 21 the division announced the awarding of a contract to a company that will digitize the state 's licenses until now new jersey licenses were printed on paper and therefore were notoriously easy to counterfeit will that solve the problem we hope so mr stokes said on the other hand in one state where they digitize licenses someone stole the machine
