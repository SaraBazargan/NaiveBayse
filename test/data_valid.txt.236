it is not every day that a big brokerage firm buys full pages in major newspapers to wax gloomy about stocks but that is what painewebber has been doing lately and so far its timing looks impeccable in the last two weeks painewebber has run ads warning about the risks of sky high valuations of 'new new economy stocks the long text ads were culled from a report published on march 21 by edward kerschner the firm 's chief investment strategist in that report mr kerschner likened the current mania for stock of companies with no earnings and no well defined path to ever reaching profitability to the leveraged buyout craze of the late 1980 's like buyouts then mr kerschner wrote the prices of new economy stocks have been bid up to absurd extremes mr kerschner said the firm had only felt strongly enough to take out an ad about a stock market call one other time in the last 18 years a buy recommendation on stocks in late 1998 anyone who sold internet stocks on mr kerschner 's call might be saying thank you painewebber since march 21 thestreetcom internet index is down 10 percent but clients who poured 2 billion into a new mutual fund painewebber strategy that holds mr kerschner 's favorite stocks may be muttering a different phrase it is down 6 percent since it was introduced last year patrick mcgeehan
