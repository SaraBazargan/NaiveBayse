investors buy because others are buying sell because others are selling when stock prices are rising it 's called momentum investing when they are falling it 's called panic and panic which had been building all week broke out in full on friday one of the biggest losers in the final sell off was tiffany 's the price of the jeweler 's shares abruptly fell 13 percent apparently because investors feared that it was especially vulnerable to a market decline and they may well be right he 's your guy  when stocks are high  but beware when they start to descend  it 's then that those louses  go back to their spouses  diamonds are a girl 's best friend but will the turmoil in the stock markets spill over not just into jewelry but into the real economy generally is this the end of the goldilocks economy it 's happened before never mind 1929 that stock slump occurred in an environment of institutional weakness and sheer policy stupidity that i think i hope no longer exists we are n't going to raise interest rates to peg the dollar to gold or allow banks to tumble like dominoes the example to worry about is japan in the 90 's an economic juggernaut that stumbled badly after the burst of a financial bubble and even a decade later has by no means regained its former vigor and indeed some japanese have been arguing for years that any day now the united states is going to go through the same comeuppance they experienced that our new economy is as fragile perhaps illusory as their bubble economy of the late 1980 's and after the last week a few americans may be wondering if they have a point but i 've been obsessed with japan 's economic problems for years it really bothered me to see a wealthy politically stable country seemingly unable to pull itself out of a simple demand side slump i think i have some idea why in their case what started as a mere paper loss ramified into something much worse and to me america 's prospects of avoiding a similar fate look very good broadly speaking there are three ways that a stock slump can turn into a prolonged recession first a decline in stock prices can expose an underlying lack of good projects for businesses to invest in second falling prices of assets can undermine corporate balance sheets leaving companies unable to make investments no matter how justified third a financial slump can inspire perverse government actions like raising interest rates to defend your exchange rate even as the real economy implodes on the first count america is in the midst of a technological revolution unlike japan which in 1990 was at the end not the beginning of a productivity surge and demography is on our side a steadily growing work force thanks in part to immigration should help to sustain continuing high investment on the second count things could be much worse there has been some increase in corporate debt in recent years and some individuals have of course gotten overextended but we do n't need yet more dot coms to keep the economy going and by and large the prospect that companies other than dot coms will find themselves unable to pursue profitable investment projects because they are unable to raise the cash seems remote on the final count sometimes it 's good to be big the united states has a huge economy which despite growing international trade is not all that dependent on imports so even if the new nervousness on wall street drives down the value of the dollar certainly a possibility the federal reserve wo n't feel that it has to raise interest rates to prop up our currency nor need we fear the way smaller asian countries did in 1997 98 that we will be crushed by the burden of foreign currency debts we do have debts to foreigners but relative to the size of our economy they are n't that large and anyway shhh do n't tell anyone they 're in dollars so the best bet has to be that our real economy will come through this nervous period more or less unscathed it 's been ugly in the markets but it is n't the end of the world goldilocks is still alive and well and anyone who has been selling on the belief that it is the end of the world ought to take a deep breath and calm down
