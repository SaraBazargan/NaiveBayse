it may take a village to raise a child but a family still ought to be able to afford one it now costs about 160140 to raise a middle class child through age 17 according to the department of agriculture 's annual report expenditures on children by families that 's up from 25229 in 1960 and 69333 in 1980 seemingly a huge increase but that 1960 figure adjusted for inflation would equal 141 998 today so in fact the cost of brining up baby has risen only about 13 percent since 1960 housing has always been the biggest single expense these days making up about a third of the cost of rearing a child just as it did 40 years ago but many other expenditures have changed since then in 1960 for example child care was a tiny subcategory lumped into overall housing costs in the 1970 's however as mothers of young children poured into the work force child care expenditures shot up by the 1980 's child care and education were given their own category which now comprises an average 10 percent of expenses for preteens education costs school supplies books and tuition have risen too they now accounts for 8 percent of family spending on teenagers up from only 2 percent in 1960 a large proportion of that increase is likely due to spending on private school according to mark lino the agriculture department economist responsible for the report health care costs 4 percent of the total in 1960 are now at 7 percent having risen sharply in the last 10 years food and clothing by contrast have n't fallen as a percentage of the whole single parent families spend about as much on each oftheir children as much as two parent families by using a greater share of their income for their children and across all income strata families with a single child lavish about a third more on that child than families with three or more children spend on each of theirs the rich spend about half again as much on food clothes and health care than the poor and more than twice as much on housing childcare and education costs are highest in in western cities lowest in rural areas and midwestern cities and as every parent finds out older children cost more than younger ones child care costs go down but not enough to make up for all the extra food clothes and video games the middle income baby born last year incidentally will have cost 236680 by the year 2016 the department of agriculture estimates but do n't worry that 's not adjusted for inflation keep in mind however that even after college bills are paid almost half of all parents in their fifties are still supporting their over 21 children correction may 21 2000 sunday an article last sunday about the average cost of raising children born in 1999 referred incorrectly to the amount 230680 that would be spent per child by the year 2016 the figure was indeed adjusted for inflation at 43 percent a year
