potato salad may not strictly be seasonal but like local strawberries backyard grilling and gin and tonic it signals summer and its adaptable nature makes it appropriate for everything from a picnic to an elaborate dinner defining potato salad is cultural whether or not the recipe calls for a mayonnaise dressing warm bacon hard cooked eggs chunks of unpeeled potatoes a sharp vinegar edge grated carrot a touch of sweetness or diced herring often depends on the heritage of the cook potato salad can involve any of these variations and more good potato salad depends on a couple of essential principles first is that the type of potato must be suitable a waxy firm textured but somewhat moist new potato is best storage potatoes like the typical russet baking varieties tend to be too dry and mealy for proper slicing and handling and they are more likely to sop up the dressing than to be coated with it look for red bliss creamer yukon gold and red or pale yellow skinned new potatoes careful seasoning is the second critical factor potatoes are fairly bland and can take a good amount of salting and peppering also if the salad is to be served cold it 's important to season it well because chilling will mute the flavors a splash of vinegar on warm potatoes that have just been cooked and drained provides a nice seasoning boost whether to peel the potatoes is a matter of taste if small and uniform in size they can be left whole or halved larger ones are better peeled cut in half or quarters for cooking and sliced when done all pieces should be of uniform size so they cook at the same rate a general rule of thumb when it comes to dressing is about a cup of sauce to a pound of potatoes a little less if a vinaigrette or mixture of a somewhat thin consistency is used mayonnaise is classic but its richness can be tempered with plain yogurt the notion that mayonnaise can be unsafe to eat in warm weather has been proved incorrect when commercial mayonnaise is used it is made with high acidity to prevent spoilage but homemade mayonnaise requires careful handling and should be kept chilled the list of additions suitable for potato salad is endless but something oniony and some green herbs for color are good to add and a dollop of sharp mustard in the dressing is never a mistake classic potato salad total time 35 minutes 3 pounds medium size red or yukon gold
