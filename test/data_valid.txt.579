brad pitt beaten out by a clown fish it has been that kind of summer at the box office where ticket sales have slipped from last year 's record levels and the hottest movie is the computer animation comedy finding nemo the father son fish tale from pixar animation studios which has taken in an estimated 3038 million since opening may 30 dreamworks skg meanwhile has been one of the latest studios disappointed by a collective shrug from moviegoers its hand animated sinbad legend of the seven seas featuring the voice of brad pitt as the lead pirate has generated an estimated 233 million since opening july 2 including an estimated 18 million this past weekend and sinbad is not the only disappointment so far this year for dreamworks of the four movies it has released including live action and animation only the comedy old school starring luke wilson and will ferrell has made more than 40 million at the domestic box office according to nielsen edi which tallies cinema receipts but sinbad may be the failure that stings most after all jeffrey katzenberg a founder of dreamworks is a former disney executive who revived that company 's animation department with hits like the lion king and brokered the distribution partnership between disney and pixar that has yielded animated hits like toy story and monsters inc sinbad may exemplify a market that has changed faster than even animation pros like mr katzenberg could have anticipated as a traditional style hand drawn animated feature the movie took four years to make a period in which audiences have come to prefer computer animated comedies like shrek an academy award winner made by dreamworks to serious animated action adventures disney 's hand drawn treasure planet which bombed last winter had perhaps given dreamworks a sign of the apathy sinbad might face even though the popular actresses michelle pfeiffer and catherine zeta jones joined mr pitt in putting words in the characters mouths we are extremely disappointed said ann daly the head of animation for dreamworks noting that sinbad would be the studio 's last traditionally drawn film from now on dreamworks will use computers to animate its movies even mr katzenberg concedes that the art form on which he made his reputation may be obsolete i think the idea of a traditional story being told using traditional animation is likely a thing of the past he said among other factors mr katzenberg said fast evolving technology is making it easier to create images that a few years ago could only be drawn by hand the studio has much hope riding on the two computer animations set for next year a sequel to the comedic shrek and the much anticipated sharkslayer a wise cracking undersea adventure about organized crime using the voices of will smith robert de niro and martin scorsese dreamworks executives declined to say how much sinbad cost some industry people have conservatively estimated that dreamworks spent 70 million not including marketing expenses although the comparable treasure planet cost disney about 140 million according to animation industry executives ms daly said that whatever the losses on sinbad they would not be financially devastating with opening weekends more crucial than ever for movies especially summer films sinbad was hurt badly by the failure of children and young teenagers to turn out in the first few days that same weekend many young girls and their mothers were off seeing reese witherspoon in legally blonde 2 red white blonde while boys and men of all ages were watching arnold schwarzenegger in terminator 3 rise of the machines meanwhile finding nemo despite opening in may still had legs or fins at least children and their parents who might have otherwise have gone to sinbad were in many cases opting to see finding nemo once again said paul dergarabedian president of exhibitor relations which tracks box office sales sinbad was not the only hand drawn animation overshadowed by the popularity of finding nemo with both adults and children rugrats go wild released by viacom 's paramount pictures this summer and based on two of viacom 's nickelodeon cable television shows the rugrats and the wild thornberrys has brought in only an estimated 334 million at the domestic box office since opening in mid june there are a handful of movies grabbing the audience and everything else is getting pushed aside mr dergarabedian said nemo is playing a lot longer than anyone would have thought errol flynn is long gone but the contemporary public is still sometimes willing to watch buccaneers ply their trade disney 's pirates of the caribbean curse of the black pearl an action adventure starring johnny depp and based on the popular theme park attraction brought in 46 million its first weekend two weeks ago and has now grossed an estimated 1322 million the problem with sinbad like treasure planet may lie more in the evidently flawed strategy that many large studios embarked on several years ago to produce animated action oriented adventure movies to attract boys said jerry beck an animation historian almost all these movies have failed mr beck said last year 's treasure planet an outer space update of robert louis stevenson 's adventure novel treasure island brought in only 38 million domestically another space adventure 20th century fox 's hand animated titan ae fared worse bringing in 227 million in 2000 ms daly pointed out that the only animated movies whether hand drawn or computer generated that have done well recently are comedies including finding nemo and last summer 's hand drawn lilo stitch from disney and so dreamworks executives are looking forward to next year 's jokey shrek 2 and sharkslayer certainly the marketing onslaught has begun during sinbad 's opening weekend in fact the studio gave people who attended the film a limited edition read along compact disc titled shrek and fiona 's honeymoon storybook and in june the studio took out full page ads in trade newspapers announcing the release schedule of shrek 2 as well as giving out promotional baseball caps with the film 's logo and opening date for anyone who missed it shrek 2 opens june 18 2004
