reed brody has a world map on the wall of his small office in the empire state building it has about 50 tiny black and white photos of various dictators warlords generals and former heads of state tacked unceremoniously to their respective countries or places of self imposed exile many of the most notorious killers on the planet are there a kind of rogues gallery and this slightly rumpled lawyer is at the forefront of the effort to bring them to trial mr brody 49 does not think the united states as in the case of osama bin laden or saddam hussein should try to administer frontier justice it is better he insists to work through world consensus and support the new international criminal court and the establishment of war crimes tribunals mr brody oversees investigations at human rights watch many started by domestic rights groups seeking to bring a score of former strongmen to trial he initiated the case against chad 's former dictator hissene habre who ruled from 1982 to 1990 and was arrested in senegal in 1990 accused of 40000 murders and systematic torture mr brody also helped spearhead the effort to extradite gen augusto pinochet the former chilean dictator from great britain to stand trial in spain when in 1998 britain 's law lords ruled there was no immunity from prosecution on charges of torture mr brody was ecstatic he said suddenly although mr pinochet was allowed to go back to chile victims groups around the globe began to organize and hope for justice the pinochet case showed us that if the circumstances were right victims could go after their former tormentors in other countries he said it was the first modern case to put this into practice mr brody 's awakening to the injustices and repression that color so many lives on the planet took place two decades ago in latin america he made a five month trip after he graduated from columbia law school and passed the bar exam hitchhiking with his argentine girlfriend he stayed for a while in the tin mines of bolivia outraged when he matched the price of tin on the world market against the working conditions and pitiful wages of bolivian miners and he embraced the social activism in the catholic church i try to gravitate to situations where the lines are clear where there is a good guy and a bad guy he said he was a young lawyer in the new york state attorney general 's office in the early 1980 's when he quit his job took his 1000 in savings and went to nicaragua spending four months taking affidavits of those who witnessed atrocities carried out by the contra rebels which were backed by the united states his detailed report in 1984 earned him a personal attack from president ronald reagan but received wide publicity it helped lead to a brief suspension in aid by congress to the nicaraguan rebels from there he tumbled head first into the world of advocacy working in places like haiti el salvador zaire tibet and cambodia he ended up as a kind of human rights bounty hunter the first such position at human rights watch but he acknowledges that the world is not as much as he would like it to be divided between the forces of light and darkness his father who as a hungarian jew spent time in german labor camps and later joined the red army tried to temper his son 's exuberance as someone who had lived through the heralding of so many new dawns my father was skeptical he said my father saw that i was starry eyed 'reedy he said imitating his father 's hungarian accent 'when you went to nicaragua i was afraid you were going to come back a communist but a catholic i never expected no he did not convert he grew up in fort greene in brooklyn with his mother an art teacher his childhood bedroom was papered with maps that inspired a wanderlust his father who separated from his mother taught russian literature mr brody still lives in brooklyn with his brazilian partner myriam marques rhavi her son from a previous marriage and zachary their 2 year old son mr brody speaks in a sleepy voice and his sentences cascade off at times into a whisper but start him on his pet subjects the atrocities of idi amin in uganda jean claude duvalier in haiti or alfredo stroessner in paraguay and the words pour out if you kill one person you end up in jail he said if you kill 20 people you end up in an insane asylum if you kill 20000 people you get an amnesty with this kind of record it is hard to build a new ethic he said he had not given up on a new ethic one in which the united states would not only back the effort to bring the world 's worst killers to justice but look inward at what he sees as its own crimes tacked to his map is a small picture of former secretary of state henry kissinger a man who he said is responsible for enormous human suffering because of united states foreign policy in east timor vietnam and chile in the 1970 's mr kissinger has vigorously rejected such accusations to bring to justice the perpetrators of atrocity is to restore the dignity of the victims he said to reaffirm that they have rights and they too count public lives correction october 14 2002 monday the public lives profile on oct 3 about reed brody
