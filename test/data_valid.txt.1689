from the new new york hotel to the new green jets banner on giants stadium to the new locker room with the super bowl iii trophy it was supposed to be different for the jets this season and for their fans your team the jets glossy marketing brochure promised will be proud to operate out of our new state of the art locker room immediately adjacent to the field tunnel the effect should provide a huge morale boost to our team and recognition that this is our home field the new wider lockers will have all of the modern team technologies along with more space and a design emphasizing team unity but in yesterday 's 44 7 rout by the new england patriots that pride turned into embarrassment as the reigning super bowl champions produced a state of the art performance in the jets oval locker room with its cherry wood cubicles and a green and gray ny carpet all those modern team technologies along with all that space and a design that was supposed to emphasize team unity only emphasized team unity in reverse no offense no defense no special teams no nothing except one meaningless touchdown after the patriots had leaped to a 27 0 lead game day get ready for a green day the brochure read the new york jets have initiated a number of major initiatives for game day at the meadowlands in an effort to develop a genuine home field advantage for your team but the most important major initiative a better team than last season 's 10 6 wild card entrant that lost in oakland never appeared if there was a home field advantage the patriots seemed to have it coach bill belichick and three of his assistants romeo crennel charlie weis and eric mangini were on the jets staff under bill parcells another assistant the linebackers coach pepper johnson played under parcells with the jets and the giants seven ex jets were on the patriots roster and do n't forget to notice the phrase new york jets not just jets ever since the jets moved across the hudson to giants stadium after 20 seasons in shea stadium the team had spent the night before a home game in a new jersey hotel until saturday night for this season 's home opener the jets slept at the marriott financial center next to where the world trade center towers once reached for the sky it was a nice new york idea but the problem was the jets played as if they were still sleeping there for the 2002 season the jets brochure read we 've completely reworked the videoboard graphics program introduced a new public address announcer and will continue to work with the new jersey sports and exposition authority to provide a superior in stadium game presentation as part of this initiative we need you in your seats for kickoff to launch the team but the jets forgot to rework the offense that converted only 1 of 12 third down situations into a first down the new public address announcer had to tell the truth the patriots defense scored two touchdowns one on a 90 yard interception return by the former jets safety victor green compared with one touchdown by the jets an 11 yard pass from vinny testaverde to tight end anthony becht late in the third quarter by then most of the rain dampened spectators in the usual announced crowd of 78726 were on the way home due to the strong tailgating tradition of our fans the brochure read we have initiated a number of improvements in the parking lot to enhance your overall game experience first and foremost the tailgate oases will provide team stores in three locations along with food and beverage offerings restrooms and entertainment including the espn radio pregame show but the overall game experience always includes the game itself and with the patriots hurrying to 432 total yards while the jets rushed for only 32 yards curtis martin had 5 yards on 4 carries the fans overall game experience was overwrought we have also completely overhauled our retail merchandise line for the 2002 season the brochure read which will be available exclusively on our web site and on game day at the tailgate oases but now coach herman edwards needs to completely overhaul his team 's approach to their next two games both in florida next sunday at miami against the 2 0 dolphins and at jacksonville the following sunday after that the jets return here to play kansas city the good thing edwards said is that we 've got seven more left at home hopefully we can even it up right now we 're not very good at home right now the jets new hotel the jets new green banner and the jets new locker room have yet to justify even the price of printing the jets glossy marketing brochure a pro football team 's marketing is only as good as the team
