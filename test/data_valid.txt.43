american jewish groups applauded the victory of ariel sharon yesterday and his brand of rough realism but some expressed the fear that he might extend his reputation as one of the region 's harshest men leaders of the groups some of whom said they had supported the government of ehud barak said they expected mr sharon 's victory to end what they maintained were mr barak 's conciliatory policies in the face of palestinian violence others predicted that the new government would pull back from the negotiating table or retaliate against palestinian targets more harshly than mr barak did either approach they said would probably find strong support among american jews sharon was not put in office by people who want him to wage war but he will wage peace from a position of power said rabbi avi shafran a spokesman for agudath israel an organization of rigorously observant jews he wo n't stand by when jewish blood is spilled with abandon rabbi marvin hier dean of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles echoed the new toughness expressed by many american jews if there is a eulogy to be delivered over the election of arik sharon it is not over the peace process but over a process that accepts the notion of peace with violence rabbi hier said in a statement the response of america 's jews yesterday in some ways tracks the usual trends of political conservatives supporting likud party candidates and liberals supporting labor party candidates but some of those interviewed said that the perceived failure of the barak experiment has prompted a toughening among american jews of all viewpoints rabbi eric yoffie the president of the union of american hebrew congregations an organization of some 900 reform synagogues around the united states spoke of enormous anger among his constituents over mr arafat 's perceived rejection of mr barak 's offers there is a broad consensus that there will be no peace in the short term rabbi yoffie said sharon is not going to go running after arafat and begging him to negotiate for all the triumphalism some expressed worries that mr sharon a former army general lacked the necessary diplomatic skills to navigate among the demands of his hard line constituency moderate palestinians and world opinion i think sharon will be a tremendous public relations challenge for israel said lewis roth of americans for peace which favors negotiations with the palestinians his reputation travels before him and he carries a lot of baggage with it mr roth said he worried that a hard line approach could ultimately bring israel into conflict with the united states because such a policy might alienate america 's allies in the region particularly moderate arab countries a sharon policy of expanding existing jewish settlements in the west bank could put the united states in a particularly difficult spot if you 're a moderate arab state why should you support the us in isolating iraq if the us is supporting sharon mr roth asked another worry is that mr sharon in shoring up his own position will have to step outside the israeli mainstream and appeal to the more extreme groups on the right i do n't believe that ariel sharon will be able to play the game well he needs to appeal to his base in israel and that demands taking a brazen stance said rabbi david gedzelman creative and rabbinic director of makor a jewish cultural group barak understood how to play western opinion sharon does n't care the sharon victory reaction correction february 9 2001 friday an article on wednesday about the reaction of american jewish groups to the election of ariel sharon as prime minister of israel misstated the name of a group that favors negotiation with the palestinians it is americans for peace now not americans for peace
