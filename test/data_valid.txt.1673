new choreography by charlotte griffin and adam hougland two young juilliard school alumni and astonishingly polished performances of two ballets by jiri kylian added up to an especially strong showing by the juilliard dance ensemble on thursday night there was also contrast thanks to the sheer adrenaline rush of mr hougland 's energetic imagination and the more intimate detail of ms griffin 's wit as for mr kylian longtime director of the netherlands dance theater he obviously had confidence that his works would be performed on a professional level by the students of the school 's dance division that confidence has not been misplaced if the kylian works were so well rendered on thursday night at the juilliard theater it is because there has been a strong improvement on the ballet side modern dance has always been the division 's strong suit but the fusion of ballet and modern dance idioms in mr kylian 's un ballo and sechs tanze as well as intarsia mr hougland 's premiere required a firm base in ballet technique mr hougland a 1999 graduate who has already choreographed for several troupes including the limon dance company is certainly a talent to follow in intarsia he has filled tchaikovsky 's familiar souvenir de florence with unexpected images that alternate muscular power and private alienation the choreography has a strong design element amplified by the lighting and decor of clifton taylor which consists of a tepee structure of ladders with curved rungs and a web of steel coils stretching out to the wings the title refers to the way colors are knit into textiles and in italy to a style of inlaid woodwork mr hougland weaves in some sort of nonspecific drama rachel tess and daniel wiley enormously talented dancers have a romantic duet after the ensemble rushes in electrifyingly in the first section like specks in an infinite universe ms tess and mr wiley seek love and comfort the first section had them climbing ladders aspiring to something higher then hanging over an abyss when they make contact they are sometimes linked by hooked insteps but usually by virtuosic partnering mr wiley has the precision of a noble classical dancer and his solo captures a tension that mr hougland plays out in contrast to the music at other times the women stretch along with the score 's yearning motif the last ensemble is not quite as sustained as the first which opens with the powerful jolene baldini a modern fury leaping in with a silent cry she calls in an ensemble that divides into six pairs and then trios the partnering recalls both antony tudor and mr kylian but mr hougland has his own ideas jane sato stands out within a very good crowd in between the shoes ms griffin a 1997 graduate has used a commissioned playful score with a latin tinge by milica paranosic played by an onstage musical ensemble in each section a prop or part of a costume is left behind until finally randy castillo puts on the blue shoes green shawl and red hat of the other dancers and uses the yellow fan with which benjamin stewart kept the heat away while five peons sweated alongside elisabeth motley did wonders with a stylish abstract tango solo and marion williams 's costumes made for a brightly colorful ensemble the best was the first part a jigsaw puzzle of a samba into which ms baldini and corey scott gilbert fitted their angular frames so perfectly those familiar with un ballo set to ravel will still find mr kylian 's jokes performed with all the right speed and precision the men in wigs and women in petticoats in his mozart comic piece sechs tanze add a new fey accent and look funnier than ever david briskin conducted the juilliard theater orchestra
