recordings have done a great deal to round out our impressions of franz liszt with most of his grand symphonic essays spacious choral works and intimately scaled art songs available on disc listeners today have an opportunity to take the full measure of this complex and often puzzling composer yet most listeners still regard liszt as a composer of splashy picturesque finger breaking works some sublime and others bombastic and trashy the music departments at the riverside church and st paul 's chapel at columbia university hope to redress that view in arts and spirituality a liszt festival that opened on tuesday evening at st paul 's and will continue through the weekend at riverside church the focus is liszt 's sacred music and the centerpiece of the opening concert was via crucis his expansive evocation for piano choir and vocal soloists of the 14 stations of the cross but liszt 's secular music is not ignored the concert began with performances of un sospiro and les jeux d'eaux a la villa d'este one of the festival 's drawing cards is the use of the erard piano built around 1862 that liszt owned and used after 1870 the instrument had disappeared after 1904 but was discovered and identified a decade ago by carlo maria dominici a pianist mr dominici bought and restored the instrument and he has used it for concerts and recordings mr dominici gave a brief overview of the piano which has a heavier action that that of a modern steinway and is tuned lower than standard concert pitch it takes a moment to get used to the erard and of course the sound on tuesday was altered to a great extent by the resonance of the chapel still what came through was a rich powerful bass and a top that was often supple but occasionally bright and a little brittle a modern concert grand with its lighter action and more predictable response can be lighter and more transparent in delicate music and one missed those qualities in mr dominici 's performances of un sospiro and les jeux d'eaux a la villa d'este via crucis a work of the late 1870 's was close to liszt 's heart but found little support in his lifetime it has some endearing qualities particularly a freewheeling character that touches on everything from formal chant and a famous lutheran chorale melody to more advanced harmonic ideas its piano writing includes some beautifully meditative moments as well as some less interesting melodrama which mr dominici played with strength and spirit the most striking music though was in the choral writing which was given a lovely rendering by the riverside chamber singers conducted by helen h cha pyo
