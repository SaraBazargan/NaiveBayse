he is just the house rider he concedes that he has more in common with the lads who groom and exercise the horses than he does with sheiks who sign his paycheck but the jockey frankie dettori has his opinions he made them known yesterday sakhee the winner of the arc de triomphe ought to run in the 2 million breeders cup turf the other big horse from godolphin stables fantastic light is the natural victor for the 4 million classic on dirt at the distance of a mile and a quarter if i do n't fall off or if sakhee does n't lose a shoe then it 's all a formality dettori who is from italy said unfortunately it is more complicated than that with the breeders cup world thoroughbred championships just three days away sheik mohammed bin rashid al maktoum of dubai who owns fantastic light and his brother sheik hamdan who owns sakhee have not decided which of their two world class runners will take on the best america has to offer in one of the most important races in the world they will have to decide before tomorrow 's post position draw dettori of course has more selfish motives and has offered his counsel dettori would like two chances to record his third victory on the most important day of racing internationally otherwise he would have to choose between the horses if they were both entered in the classic the horses trainer has no such qualms sheik hamdan will make the decision and whatever he decides to do is fine with me saeed bin suroor the trainer for the dubai based godolphin stables said with 19 european runners here for saturday 's breeders cup world thoroughbred championships an eight race card worth a combined 13 million at belmont park dettori made it clear that foreign challengers had a very good chance at recording an encore victory in the afternoon 's marquee race now in its 18th running but captured only once by an international horse arcangues in 1993 still dettori who won the breeders cup mile in 1994 aboard barathea and the turf in 1999 with daylami did not rule out that a depleted fleet of american horses just might be a little bit better you ca n't disrespect the americans on dirt in their own backyard he said it 's not going to be a two horse race the other horse is galileo a 3 year old colt who has won six of seven career races his loss was to fantastic light galileo 's rider michael kinane was much more restrained about his colt 's chances he acknowledged that galileo 's switch from the turf the predominant surface in europe to dirt was a major obstacle so was asking the colt to run against older horses after a long campaign we started in april and now we 're asking him in late october to keep running kinane said he 's a very genuine colt but this is his biggest test yet this is a long time with a 3 year old you need fresh legs this time of year galileo 's trainer aidan o'brien said he believed his colt was ready o'brien 32 has dominated european races and ran a very close second to tiznow with giant 's causeway in last year 's classic in recent weeks he has conditioned galileo on all weather tracks and believes his horse a son of sadler 's wells can handle the surface switch our horses compete at the top level here and run in all the big races that they can run in he said by telephone last week and we try to totally expose them in all the turf races and then come the end of the year if they 're still in one piece and hopefully after the flight out we just try and expose them as much as we could it obviously is a great race they 're huge races whether it 's fantastic light or sakhee or galileo the foreign horses have a stake in leaving belmont park with a champion in the classic it 's the top race in north america simon crisford godolphin 's racing manager said it 's the race that everyone in europe everyone around the world wants to win crisford concedes that the europeans feel outflanked by the move to dirt but not outgunned we have plenty of turf championship races in europe he said and we compete amongst ourselves because the north american horses never really come and take us on in europe which is a very big shame the only evidence we 've got as to whether they can adapt to it or not is actually just like watching them train and what type of temperament they have it 's so different from turf racing i mean it 's just a world apart from european racing on turf to dirt racing in america and if we believe we 've got a horse who can actually make a real go of it then that 's the race we want to go for
