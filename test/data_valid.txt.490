when i covered the brutal psychodrama of clarence thomas and anita hill that ferocious week in october '91 i used to wake up in the middle of the night haunted by the mystery of who was telling the big lie how could we put someone on the supreme court for life without knowing but everyone was playing to win so the truth never really entered into it now a decade later david brock a right wing hit man who was in league back then with the bush white house steps forward to talk about truth and lies the journalist now says he lied then when he painted anita hill as a liar a woman who was a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty both in an american spectator piece and a best seller embraced by conservatives called the real anita hill and he says he lied then when he helped the bushies and conservatives portray clarence thomas as truthful calling himself a witting cog in the republican sleaze machine his former conservative allies say that mr brock is lying now in his apologia contained in a book called blinded by the right the conscience of an ex conservative to be published in september and excerpted in august 's talk magazine i had stumbled onto something big mr brock writes a symbiotic relationship that would help create a highly profitable right wing big lie machine that flourished in book publishing on talk radio and on the internet throughout the 90 's the '91 hearings turned on the republican effort to smear anita hill as an erotomaniac while suppressing reports popping up from judge thomas 's friends and supporters that he was often a patron of x rated movie houses while a student at yale law school in the early 1970 's and that he would sometimes humorously describe the pornographic movies to his friends and colleagues just as ms hill had testified he did with her to that end senator orrin hatch said it was unthinkable that judge thomas could ever have discussed long dong silver and other porn with her because anyone who would do that would be a psychopathic sex fiend or a pervert judge thomas agreed that he would never approach anyone i was attempting to date as a person with this kind of grotesque language after he ascended to the supreme court two friends of mine jill abramson and jane mayer wrote a book called strange justice that reported that when he worked with ms hill he regularly rented adult movies at graffiti a local video shop stocked with long dong silver movies in the book kaye savage a former career civil servant in the reagan white house and social friend of both clarence and anita said she visited mr thomas 's bachelor apartment in the summer of 1982 and saw explicit photos of nude women mr brock writes in talk that he tried to discredit strange justice in a spectator review with the help of justice thomas and the white house according to mr brock he used as an intermediary a bush white house lawyer named mark paoletta to ask justice thomas if he had owned video equipment in the early 1980 's paoletta mr brock writes came back with a straightforward answer not only had thomas had such equipment in his apartment he had also often rented pornographic movies from graffiti during the years that hill worked for him mr brock writes that thomas passed along through paoletta unverified embarrassing personal information about his friend kaye savage that thomas claimed had been raised against her in a divorce proceeding thomas was playing dirty and so was i justice thomas had no comment mr paoletta told the times that he had not confirmed to mr brock that mr thomas rented or watched pornography and said that justice thomas did not ask me to pass along any derogatory information about kaye savage and ms savage told the times that mr brock had either got it from clarence or he got it from anita and anita 's my friend a column last week said that representative gary condit was one of the few democrats to vote for the impeachment of bill clinton mr condit voted in favor of opening the impeachment inquiry but in the end voted against impeachment
