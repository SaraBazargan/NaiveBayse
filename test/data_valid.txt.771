the time has come for that old baseball man george w bush to recall the words of another old baseball man leo durocher nice guys finish last they do n't win presidential elections either mr bush 's seeming unawareness of this adage has been fostering a growing sense of unease among his core supporters when he killed a commercial prepared by the republican national committee last month because it was not fully accurate he may have hoped that his high road strategy would start to work again it did n't today mr bush may be showing he is finally aware of the problem the rnc is airing a new spot that hammers the vice president for his fund raising activities undoubtedly mr bush will be criticized for allowing the rnc to run these ads and for breaking his pledge to run an optimistic positive campaign in the reagan tradition as he promised to nancy reagan last spring but there is nothing wrong with going on the attack and he must start doing it himself on the campaign trail part of the myth of ronald reagan is that he was above the battle that he lived 100 percent by his eleventh commandment thou shalt not speak ill of another republican and that he applied it to democrats as well gerald ford jimmy carter and walter mondale can testify that this myth is not accurate so could george w 's father in politics as in the movies mr reagan was always a white hat guy and he understood that it is also necessary that your opponent wear a black hat mr bush needs to take the same approach he can treat mr gore in good humor with a smile or with a tone of regret that 's what mr reagan did with mr carter in their 1980 debate when he said there you go again in fact he was calling mr carter a liar but with a needle not a bludgeon while not a ronald reagan mr bush exudes warmth and friendliness therefore he can attack without raising his voice without calling names without snarling or sneering but he is going to have to remind voters about mr gore the political fund raiser the extreme environmentalist the man who is not always truthful after all mr gore has already attacked mr bush on his record as texas governor and on his ties to big oil if mr bush does not reciprocate he is likely to find out that the best fate has to offer him is two more years as governor lyn nofziger was an aide to president ronald reagan
