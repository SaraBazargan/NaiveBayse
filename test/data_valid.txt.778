rajeev ram might be the united states most promising serve and volley player he is also one of its few serve and volley players a lot of these guys i 'm playing here are a little shocked when they see somebody coming to the net other than to shake hands ram said yesterday after defeating andres dellatorre of argentina 6 0 6 3 in the first round of the united states open qualifying competition ram 19 uses a fading art that might have seen the last of one of its great practitioners pete sampras because sampras the winner of 14 grand slam singles titles is on the brink of retirement ram 's idol growing up in carmel ind was boris becker whose big serve and knack for rushing the net propelled him to six grand slam singles titles i 've always enjoyed that way of playing ram said being bigger having a decent serve and pretty good hands it just kind of fell into place ram 6 feet 4 inches and 185 pounds has some filling out to do but his hardcourt power game was enough to overwhelm dellatorre a clay court specialist on an outer court of the usta national tennis center in flushing meadows queens dellatorre did what most players these days do grinding out points from the baseline but ram held serve comfortably and dellatorre sprayed balls in a far more erratic matter than his rally friendly game could allow ram said his scrambles to the frontcourt kept dellatorre of argentina out of his comfort zone that happens a lot he said taylor dent ranked no 73 is the country 's more established serve and volley specialist but ram 's performance in the past year has attracted attention last fall he won a futures professional tournament in laguna niguel calif while retaining his amateur status he enrolled as a freshman at the university of illinois in january and helped illinois win the ncaa team championship in may a surprising accomplishment for a midwest school in the final against vanderbilt ram won both his singles and doubles matches on the junior circuit he won the prestigious easter bowl 18 and under title in 2001 and the wimbledon doubles title in 2002 despite an early rush of success ram does not plan to turn pro immediately he said he did not want to be regretful in five years for making a decision too quickly his coach at illinois craig s tiley said his serve and volley required more refinement anyway if he rushes into it then in the rigors of playing week in and week out you do n't have a chance to physically develop yourself he said then you get injured and then you get behind ram must win two more matches to qualify for the united states open 's main draw his opponent in the second round of qualifying is jan vacek of the czech republic who yesterday defeated petr luxa also of the czech republic 6 4 6 2 in 2001 ram gained entry into the united states open qualifying as a wild card and lost in the first round but even if he falls short this time in the qualifying he will still play doubles in the main draw with brian wilson his illinois teammate i need to see where my game is to get better and focus on improving this whole week ram said ram who serves in the 120 mile an hour range said he wanted a bigger serve like the one employed by sampras who swept opponents out of position so he could move in for the kill my game is to get in and finish the point at the net rather than hit it 149 miles an hour he said
