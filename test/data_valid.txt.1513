president bush said today that the united states was making good progress in iraq as the white house released a 24 page report asserting that the american led occupation had improved the lives of iraqi citizens and the safety and security of the rest of the world mr bush 's comments and the release of the report titled results in iraq 100 days toward security and freedom represented an aggressive new push by the white house to counter months of american deaths and increasingly grim news out of baghdad the iraqi capital the report said that most of iraq was calm and that only in isolated areas are there still attacks it did not mention the car bomb that ripped through the jordanian embassy in the heart of baghdad on thursday it said that iraq 's water supply was at prewar levels that electricity was more stable and that a 53 million program to rehabilitate more than 100 schools was under way i am pleased with the progress we 've made but fully recognize that we 've got a lot more work to do mr bush said in a brief question and answer session with reporters as vice president dick cheney and defense secretary donald h rumsfeld stood at his side they were joined by gen richard b myers chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and condoleezza rice mr bush 's national security adviser the president made his comments 100 days after he declared major combat operations in iraq over in a celebratory ceremony off the california coast on the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln in his remarks today delivered in inferno like heat on the front lawn of his central texas home mr bush did not reprise his proud phrase then that in the battle of iraq the united states and our allies have prevailed instead he spoke in the more practical language of an occupier who was trying to rebuild a country from scratch in a lot of places the infrastructure is as good as it was at prewar levels which is satisfactory but it 's not the ultimate aim he said the ultimate aim is for the infrastructure to be the best in the region the report was prepared by the white house office of global communications and the coalition provisional authority the american run administrative organization in baghdad it focused on 10 areas where it said the occupation had improved the lives of iraqis the 10 chapter titles included ten ways the liberation of iraq supports the war on terror along with ten signs of economic renewal and ten signs of cultural rebirth the report did not mention the 56 american troops who have died in iraq since mr bush declared major combat over under ten signs of economic renewal the report said that banks were open in baghdad and that the american administrative organization was working to open other banks across the country in the ten signs of cultural rebirth section it said that the baghdad symphony was performing and that satellite dishes were the most popular items for sale in the iraqi capital but the introduction noted that the steps toward sovereignty and democracy will be difficult and require patience and time in his remarks to reporters mr bush dismissed the criticism by some democrats including al gore that he had misled the public about the threat posed by iraq in a speech in new york on thursday mr gore accused mr bush of promoting false impressions about the need for attacking baghdad it 's just pure politics mr bush said we 've got a lot of people running for president and it 's pure politics he did not answer a question about whether he agreed with the commander of forces in iraq lt gen ricardo s sanchez who said on thursday that american troops would be in iraq for at least two more years mr bush only repeated that this administration will do what is necessary to win the war on terror in additional comments to reporters mr rumsfeld appeared to acknowledge an article today in newsday reporting that pentagon officials had met with manucher ghoreanifar a major figure in the 1980 's iran contra scandal in order to push for a change of government in iran my understanding is some one or two people were approached by some people who had information about iranians that wanted to provide information to the united states that a meeting did take place mr rumsfeld said mr bush said only that we support the aspirations of those who desire freedom in iran concerning the middle east mr bush elaborated on why he is opposed to the construction of a barrier in the west bank to separate israelis and palestinians i 've said the fence is a problem because the fence is you know kind of meanders around the west bank which makes it awfully hard to develop a contiguous state over time he said referring to a future palestinian state mr bush met this morning with mr rumsfeld mr cheney ms rice and general myers about military matters which included a discussion about whether the number of american troops in iraq was sufficient to meet the continuing threat of violence when the president was asked if he was satisfied that american troops were not stretched too thin in iraq he turned to mr rumsfeld and said i 'm satisfied mr rumsfeld added that he was working to reduce stress on american troops in iraq but that he did not see the need at the present time to increase the number of american troops in the country
