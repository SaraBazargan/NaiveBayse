the price of crude oil jumped 4 percent yesterday to more than 31 a barrel and gasoline prices leaped 6 percent what is more inventories of both are so low that a moderate increase in output from major crude oil producers would provide only a little price relief if crude oil prices stay over 30 a barrel the clinton administration might finally pump some out of the strategic petroleum reserve as members of congress are urging though that would not bring immediate relief for drivers who are paying 53 percent more at the gasoline pump than they were last year it might send an unmistakable signal to major oil producers that they have strained the patience of the united states energy secretary bill richardson opposed such a move yesterday saying at a congressional hearing that it would be unwise to tap the petroleum reserve while major oil producers were still discussing production increases ahead of a march 27 meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting countries still he warned that the world is consuming about two million barrels more a day than it is producing we can not sustain this imbalance between supply and demand without risking serious repercussions for the world economy he said two wisps of bad news about petroleum supplies helped push up prices yesterday on the new york mercantile exchange crude oil for april delivery rose 134 to 3177 a barrel while the april gasoline futures contract jumped 580 cents to 9938 cents a gallon it was the highest price for crude oil since january 1991 at the time of the persian gulf war and the highest for gasoline futures since october 1990 the first problem came in the form of fresh reports from the american petroleum institute and the government 's energy information administration that showed declines in gasoline inventories which are now down 15 percent in the last year by the petroleum institute 's estimate the institute also reported that crude inventories had fallen while the energy administration 's report showed a slight increase but both reports show crude inventories down 12 percent to 13 percent from a year earlier the second piece of bad news was a denial of reports that venezuela and saudi arabia two leading producers in opec had agreed with mexico a major producer not in opec to raise crude oil output early in the day several news services reported that the three countries had agreed to propose a production increase effective april 1 the amount of the increase ranged from 1 million to 14 million barrels a day in the reports but later in the day a venezuelan oil official said there was no such agreement such talk of increases in crude oil production has come and gone for weeks in fact the mexican energy minister issued a statement yesterday saying that mexico and norway another non opec producer thought that a production increase should be discussed he gave no indication of the size of any increase but analysts and government officials say they expect major producers to start pumping more oil soon mr richardson who has just returned from lobbying for more oil in kuwait mexico saudi arabia and venezuela said i believe the odds are good for production increases to take place michael rothman the senior energy analyst at merrill lynch said that he also expected an increase but that opec ministers will keep their cards close to their vests to the last moment before their meeting on march 27 despite these expectations of increased production crude oil and gasoline prices are moving higher that is because a million or so more barrels a day will not be enough to rebuild global inventories to a comfortable level at the end of last year mr rothman said inventories of crude oil and products for the 29 countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development had fallen to 253 billion barrels a level that he said was 99 million barrels below normal oil production would have to increase more than 10 percent to ease the price pressure he said that would mean an increase in daily production of crude oil of 17 million barrels effective in april followed by an increase of 15 million barrels after opec oil ministers meet again in september oil traders mr rothman said see the impending squeeze that is already there the euro did something unusual yesterday it rallied against the dollar rising to 9748 cents from 9655 cents on tuesday but it is not clear if the euro has reached the bottom of a 14 month month slide that has erased 164 percent of its value and it is getting harder and harder to explain nicholas p sargen the global market strategist for private clients of j p morgan says one would have expected the euro to rally this year after all european economies are finally turning around and their stock markets are outperforming the dow jones industrial average and the standard poor 's 500 stock index he suspects that one reason for the decline is that the 11 nations behind the euro which was introduced in january 1999 have no one person to speak for the currency usually a country 's finance minister does the job but 11 finance ministers can not speak together and they often contradict each other so traders have been looking to wim duisenberg the president of the european central bank as the substitute mr duisenberg who has also sent some mixed signals could show that someone cared about the beleaguered euro mr sargen says how the central bank could raise its interest rate target at its meeting today
