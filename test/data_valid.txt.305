the call came from the philadelphia phillies dugout get up get ready the sixth game of the world series was falling apart and the phillies were calling ben rivera they were desperate to be sure normally a starter rivera had pitched twice in the 1993 postseason both in blowout losses with little success but the phillies had used four relievers and mitch williams was crumbling rivera was not rattled the day before his wife had given birth to their first child a daughter emmy the game was exciting life was good he started warming up in the moment you do n't know if it 's going to happen again rivera said there was no time to get nervous he never got in the game moments later the toronto blue jays won the world series when joe carter hit a three run homer off williams rivera dropped the ball on the bullpen mound and walked back to the clubhouse he could not have known it but his major league career was headed for near oblivion and he would journey around the world in search of a job the next season rivera pitched in nine games then he tore his rotator cuff it has been 3129 days since his last major league game on july 31 1994 and for most of that time rivera was sure he would not make it back i played because i loved the game he said i just played like it was my job now at 35 he is allowing himself to dream big rivera is on a 40 man roster for the first time in nine years firing fastballs for the yankees he has journeyed around the world to get here rivera missed two of the last eight seasons with injuries first to his shoulder then to his elbow he spent a frustrating season in ottawa in the montreal expos farm system taiwan was scary japan was profitable south korea was busy rivera had given up hope until last summer when scouts saw him with the mexico city red devils in my mind there were too many other pitchers rivera said when you 've been out of the game for a long time the teams have their own prospects in the minor leagues they 're not going to take their guy out and give you a spot gordon blakeley the yankees senior vice president who signed rivera acknowledged as much i 'm sure some teams said 'why would we sign someone who 's that old and has n't pitched in the big leagues for so long blakeley said he had just kind of disappeared blakeley saw enough to give rivera a chance in 47 innings last season rivera struck out 59 and earned 30 saves blakeley liked his stuff a splitter a curveball and a fastball that reached 96 miles an hour he also noticed rivera 's imposing 6 foot 6 frame the way his easy delivery sent the ball on a downhill plane the yankees signed him to a minor league deal then cringed as rivera let out their secret with a strong showing in the dominican winter league fearful of another team stealing him in the minor league draft the yankees put rivera on their 40 man roster he has little chance of breaking camp on a staff that is crowded but rivera is insurance against an injury and potential trade bait he is out of minor league options and if he pitches well he could be a bargain for a club that needs pitching he was supposed to be a sure thing by now rivera went 20 12 with a 417 earned run average for the phillies in 1992 and 1993 he was popular in the clubhouse his nickname was gentle ben and was 26 when he tried to pitch through the rotator cuff injury in 1994 we thought he had a chance to be an outstanding big league pitcher said phillies general manager ed wade who was an assistant at the time he had really good stuff and we thought his ceiling was very high when he did get hurt you really pulled for him maybe more so than you would for other guys because he was such a great kid by the time rivera realized the severity of his injury it was too late he had surgery in late december 1994 and spent the next year recovering from the injury in 1996 he signed a minor league deal with the expos but his shoulder was still weak and rivera did not pitch well in 1997 he joined a team in taiwan in a league corrupted by gamblers they knew better than to approach the quiet reliever who kept to himself the rumors were going around and if you knew baseball you could see when the game was bad rivera said nobody tried to get me i was in my own world doing my job i did n't even want to meet those guys rivera 's wife and two daughters were with him in taiwan and he wanted to leave as soon as possible he signed with the hanshin tigers in japan spending a year and a half there as a closer then he began having elbow problems rivera flew to birmingham ala for reconstructive surgery the tommy john surgery a procedure that often entails an 18 month recovery he spent 2000 in the dominican republic playing catch every day with a friend rivera was out of work but he had saved well his most lavish purchase in his brief time in the majors he said was a 1993 ford explorer he earned 800000 in japan and made it last rivera had recovered by 2001 and signed with a team in south korea but he was overworked summoned for three inning saves night after night he threw 70 innings in two and a half months he said and quit midway through the season then came mexico where the yankees found him and resurrected a dream some fans still remember rivera he had two pieces of mail in his locker last week both from fans asking him to sign baseball cards the cards show rivera as a member of the phillies 6 6 and 265 pounds now he is 20 pounds lighter but throwing nearly as hard chris widger caught him in camp last week he was throwing nice and easy easy gas as they say he said his ball kind of sneaks in on you it does n't really look like he 's trying yet and the ball comes in there quick widger was a 22 year old minor leaguer in 1993 rooting for the phillies because he had grown up near philadelphia he did not realize whom he was catching is that the same ben rivera from the world series team widger asked and he was surprised to learn that it was rivera may never return to the world series his goal now is more modest one game one more chance in the majors i can not tell you what is going to happen with myself after i pitch what i 'm going to think he said if you ask me in that moment i probably could tell you but right now i do n't know how happy i 'm going to be how proud i 'm going to be i ca n't imagine right now the way i 'm going to feel if that happens
