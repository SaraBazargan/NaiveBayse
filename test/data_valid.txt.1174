perspiration and anger dripped from nets coach byron scott as he sprayed his players with an expletive filled tirade during a second quarter timeout today the listless nets were down by 19 points to the los angeles clippers the league 's perennial punch line only a day earlier in florida george steinbrenner the yankees principal owner and corporate partner of the yankeenets had joked that five reporters could beat the nets scott was not laughing this afternoon in continental arena the nets led by stephon marbury and keith van horn salvaged a second half comeback that spilled into overtime before they defeated the clippers 102 96 it was definitely one of the low points of the year as far as him getting frustrated with us marbury said agreeing that scott 's anger was justified we were n't playing hard we were n't being aggressive we were going out playing passive as if those guys were just going to lay down marbury led the nets with 33 points including two fadeaway jumpers that tipped the overtime momentum to the nets but it was van horn the nets struggling forward who hit the key shot that helped the nets force the overtime period new jersey was down by 2 points with 106 seconds to play and marbury inbounded the ball to van horn van horn took it at the top of the key where he spun by his defender lamar odom dropped into the paint and shot a fadeaway jumper the ball tipped off the front of the rim bounced off the glass and finally fell in the basket with 31 seconds left tying it at 92 92 that seemed like forever that shot lasted 10 seconds to me said van horn who was 5 for 18 and finished with 14 points the clippers defensive scheme prevented van horn from passing back to marbury i knew i was alone and had to make a play van horn said the nets are 18 37 now breaking a three game losing streak against the clippers who are 16 38 the teams combined for 46 turnovers it was n't pretty scott said that was probably the angriest i 've ever been i just do n't think we came out ready to play after scott 's tirade the nets outscored the clippers 33 13 taking their first lead of the game in the third quarter the nets scored three times as many points in that quarter as the 12 they scored in the first when steinbrenner 's words seemed to be true while talking to baseball reporters on saturday steinbrenner discussed the devils the yankeenets other team and said to the reporters do n't mention the other team though five of you guys could beat them marbury said he understood the truth of steinbrenner 's words nah it does n't bother me the way we 've been playing some people may feel that way marbury said the nets management offered a measured response george is hoping we 'll improve and head towards the other teams he was talking about nets president rod thorn said that 's certainly his prerogative we do n't like that we 've only won 18 games now also the nets principal owner lewis katz said we 're all partners in three teams it just so happens two won the championship last year and the third is a work in progress it 's not helpful for me for anybody to make public comments that would be critical of the team the nets seemed to have screeched to a halt in the first half they did not get a field goal for the first 9 minutes 18 seconds in this contest falling behind by 21 7 lucious harris finally scored on a reverse layup with 2 42 left in the first quarter marbury added a 14 foot runner for the nets only other field goal the clippers who had led by as many as 20 points had a 19 point advantage with 4 20 to go in the half when scott intervened he had a right to be mad said harris who had a season high 18 points we came out and took this team too lightly and almost got embarrassed van horn who scored 10 points in the third quarter added sometimes your team is going to come out flat and you need to do something to get them going and that really did get us going marbury had 12 points in the third quarter which ended with the nets ahead 73 69 but odom canceled that by scoring 16 of his game high 34 points in the final period his 3 pointer with 274 seconds left gave the clippers a 91 88 lead after van horn threw an air ball with 15 seconds left the ball caromed out of bounds and the nets got the ball back harris was fouled and converted both shots with 122 seconds remaining the nets fouled the clippers eric piatkowski an 818 percent free throw shooter but he made only his first one and van horn came down with the rebound rebounds the nets outgoing general manager john nash back from a 10 day european scouting trip spoke for the first time since news of his contract 's termination became public at the end of june nash will be given a 250000 buyout i 'm going to continue to do my job as long as the nets want me to do it nash said he did not want to speculate why he was terminated nor would he discuss whether he had permission to talk to other teams nash has been general manager since june 1996 his biggest regret i would have liked for us to win more games he said he noted his multiplayer trade involving shawn bradley to dallas in 1997 that ultimately gave us the opportunity to acquire keith van horn and stephon marbury he said that trade at the time i thought that had us on the right track and a year later we were in the playoffs but since that playoff experience things were disappointing the nets backup point guard sherman douglas left the team for personal reasons and will return for wednesday 's game against toronto lucious harris had a magnetic resonance imaging test on his left knee which he hurt against detroit and again against the knicks the result was negative
