jay wright was a highly impressionable 12 years of age when he learned a valuable lesson of life sometimes no matter how hard you work you just get shut out back when he was a child in the philadelphia area two great atlantic coast conference teams north carolina state and maryland met for the single available spot in the national tournament he remembers the delicious agony as a neutral fan this time he was very much involved wright is now the 38 year old coach at hofstra university which yesterday finally overcame the inherent terror of an all or nothing game hofstra beat delaware 76 69 in the america east conference title game to qualify for the automatic bid to the great big national silliness which commences later this week in the grand ancient tradition of conference tournaments only one team was going anywhere important wright had tried to downplay the momentousness of this game held at the extremely bizarre hour of 11 30 am to accommodate espn which had discovered hofstra basketball at the same time as the rest of the world i told my staff all season that what we did in the regular season was important wright said i do n't judge us on the post season it was a reasonable approach everybody knew delaware had enough skill and character to come up to hofstra 's sparkling new arena and win this shootout both teams knew enough to not count on an at large bid for the loser that 's just the way it works hofstra has not been on this path in a long time in 1976 it lost to connecticut in the first round and in 1977 it lost to notre dame in the first round in the commotion after yesterday 's victory a longtime hofstra fan named rich weksberg from brooklyn was displaying his ticket stub from that 1977 loss in philadelphia one can only wonder what kind of low seeding horror show the ncaa tournament has in store for hofstra at some distant site this time around but that was not in the minds and hearts of the jubilant hofstra players who had heard wright 's rationale for not treating this day as the only two hours that might matter in their lives i ca n't speak for my teammates said norman richardson who scored 20 of his 26 points in the second half but my brother derrick brown played for providence in 1997 when they lost to arizona in the elite eight he told me how great it was he told me how you feel like a celebrity all week i wanted to feel that way now hofstra will go somewhere and play somebody do n't care richardson said send me anywhere this was also the attitude of speedy claxton who had stayed in his hometown to play although he had credentials to go elsewhere claxton went to christ the king high in queens where he was a teammate of the now beleaguered erick barkley at equally beleaguered st john 's with barkley 's future at st john 's very much in doubt claxton said he had not talked to his friend in the last tumultuous days and knew nothing about the mounting troubles at st john 's yesterday was hofstra 's day in his sixth year jay wright has survived a shootout comparable to the one he watched as a young fan i can remember they showed the acc tournament on raycom or some network like that wright said the other day twenty six years ago the national tournament was open only to conference champions plus select independents thus when maryland met north carolina state in the acc finals one was going to get royally shunted to the nether world wright can recall sitting in front of the tube in 1974 and watching state with dave thompson prevail over maryland with john lucas 103 100 people in the acc still call it the greatest game ever oh yes state won the national title too beat providence beat pitt beat coach wooden himself beat marquette by 12 in the final the next year they changed the rules conferences were allowed a second team just for openers leading to the eventual glut in which dozens of acc and big east and big ten coaches manipulate and maneuver and flat out beg for a berth the way downhill north carolina is bargaining this weekend the little conferences however are still back in 1974 but at least the ncaa shows a note of sanity in allowing the smallest conferences an automatic bid it 's not ok but it 's something we have to deal with claxton had said for delaware the only real possibility now is a bid to the national invitational tournament people are saying 'the big dance is everything wright had said i understand but i 'm going to make sure they do n't feel that way wright has been around he played at bucknell without qualifying and he reached the tournament as an assistant to rollie massimino for five years at villanova before losing to oklahoma in the quarterfinals long before that wright perched in front of a television set watching maryland and north carolina state battle for one spot yesterday hofstra survived that grisly retro tradition the game was desperate the celebration sweet
