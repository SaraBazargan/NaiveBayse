inevitable perhaps but sad as part of the new york fringe festival mobius group productions is presenting a new adaptation by jonathan silver of elmer rice 's 1923 classic the adding machine on this principle one might also say that sherman adapted georgia during the civil war this version changes the play from a searing tragedy about the cosmic injustice of the human condition to a comic battle between husband and wife mr zero still murders his boss in a rage and is sent by the executioner to the elysian fields but instead of being taught up there by charles and joe two drones of destiny that life is a crushing system of oppression he gets his lesson from mrs zero who it turns out has presided over his eternal degradation all along and who keeps joe around as a heavenly boy toy mr silver also shortens mr zero 's life as an accounting drudge to 10 years from 25 which makes his murder of the boss considerably more impulsive he omits entirely the six couples named one to six which saves cast costs but cuts out rice 's caustic expose of the deadly cynicism of ordinary people during an evening 's conversation and also eliminates the jury that convicts mr zero in fact there is no trial so mr zero does not make his confession or give his defense in the rice speech that is a triumph for any actor who can rise to it and a final omission that is fatal to what 's left here of rice 's play in the last scene mr zero has not mastered the divine adding machine that coldly represents modern industrial life he counts shells on a beach this play has always challenged audiences and actors its gritty dialogue demands emotional interpretation in every line and many of those lines are distractingly funny even in a serious presentation also its plot requires total surrender of disbelief by the audience yet for 80 years it has drawn extraordinary actors and directors taken as is it has an integrity and imaginative power that almost defy analysis in the theater guild 's original 1923 production a stellar cast under the direction of philip moeller created a performance that inspired other plays and movies for two generations and lee simonson 's brilliant sets including a giant icon of an adding machine were celebrated as masterpieces of graphic art mr silver who directs his adaptation has gathered a good cast paul marcarelli makes mr zero the struggling victim he must be if he 's to live at all cynthia carrol is often infectiously funny as mrs zero and a threatening presence as well jessamyn blakeslee as two women mr zero dreams about is provocative enough to make him seem a bigger man for his suppressed lust and dan da silva as mr zero 's cemetery mate shrdlu a role orginally taken by edward g robinson is a truly lovable mother killer the one character here who is pretty much the person rice imagined fringes at all times and of all sorts survive by chewing into whatever holds the center and there is no reason in nature why the foundation documents of the left should be any more immune to destruction than those of the right but seeing this social monument handled this roughly is tough performances are scheduled during the festival for todayat 5 pm thursday at 10 pm saturday at 8 30 pm and sunday at 5 45 pm the adding machine by elmer rice adapted and directed by jonathan silver lighting by michele disco sound by stefan jacobs costumes by daphne javitch production stage manager kara bain graphic design joshua dickens and rick gradone assistant stage manager karen benelli presented by mobius group productions inc a production of the present company part of the new york international fringe festival at the 14th street theater 344 east 14th street east village with cynthia carrol mrs zero paul marcarelli mr zero jessamyn blakeslee daisy and judy joshua dickens the boss policeman young man the head and joe and dan da silva shrdlu
