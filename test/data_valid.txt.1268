president bush 's turn to the united nations for help in iraq was a welcome if belated recognition that global policing can acquire legitimacy only through multinational endorsement but the records of the major political bodies of the united nations the general assembly and the security council have little to show that this is the place to find that sort of legitimacy in the 21st century the assembly is usually mired in speechmaking the council is increasingly perceived as an antiquated relic of the cold war these are not just the sentiments of neoconservatives in washington they were voiced most recently by kofi annan the secretary general of the united nations mr annan challenged the un to make radical reforms in an unusually candid report issued on sept 8 in the 58 years since the united nations charter was written the membership of the body has grown to 191 from 51 nothing in the charter provided for the relatively predictable cold war world turning into one in which terrorists move freely across state lines potentially armed with weapons of mass destruction and where there were no rules or mechanisms individual states could not be blamed for going it alone mr annan said the united nations he said was not a suicide pact mr annan called for expanding the most visible instrument of the un the security council in which five victors of world war ii hold permanent veto powers and the rest of the world rotates through the other 10 seats but the council is the instrument least likely to be reformed just imagine asking france to cede its veto to germany or pakistan to allow a permanent seat for india the last reform commission began more than 10 years ago the real task is to open a serious debate on what a multilateral institution should be and what rules and instruments it should have as the world 's leaders arrive for the general assembly 's opening this week they would do well to present some concrete ideas on what the united nations should be then before leaving they should charge a council of eminent people to work with mr annan to remake it
