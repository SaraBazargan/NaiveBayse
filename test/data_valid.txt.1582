it was familiar the silence from the sky the sober faces of nasa officials the presidential words of sympathy the grimly upbeat relatives uncles sisters mothers schooled to temper grief with an acceptance of risk there would be funerals an investigation speeches to congress lengthy reports it was familiar and that was tragic a heartbreaker as one woman in san francisco put it but it was also home ground scripted territory mercifully free from the murky uncertainties of biological and nuclear threat imminent combat terrorists with bombs in their shoes americans know how to mourn heroes lost in space they have done it before it was familiar but it was also different different for example from the faceless deaths of people whose lives end on the highway in bathtubs in hospital beds in the deserts of afghanistan the astronauts deaths were vivid unexpected the bearers of symbolic weight they represented said dr daniel gilbert a psychologist at harvard something greater than the simple loss of life they were personal involving in the language of researchers who study death 's effects on the public identified rather than statistical victims familiarity and difference shape human perception they determine what is attended to and what is ignored what stirs us and what leaves us indifferent what comforts us and what makes us afraid at the most basic cellular level the human organism is hard wired to respond to change and to habituate to what is repetitive or continuing the eye notices movement the ear an alteration in volume the nose an unfamiliar odor dripping faucets persistent smells static scenes fade into the background this capacity to adapt experts say means that after a while it is possible to forget that 170 miles above the ground seven people are hurtling through space in the equivalent of a souped up tin can shuttles go up and come down you do n't remember the launch you do n't know who 's on it and for the most part people are definitely not thinking about its return said karen brown dunlap the dean and president elect of the poynter institute for media studies in st petersburg fla or as president bush put it in an age when spaceflight has come to seem almost routine it is easy to overlook the dangers of travel by rocket adaptation also explains why neither the power of a liftoff to awe nor an explosion to shock will ever again be as intense as in earlier decades why mingled with sadness and loss there is a sense that we know what this is about and that it may in some way be preferable to disasters we have not yet experienced and know little of the first time the shuttle blows up part of our reaction is 'i had no idea this could happen dr gilbert said the second time it does n't draw quite the same response in his 1997 book into thin air jon krakauer describes a similar acclimatization to the sight of long dead human bodies on mount everest the first body had left me badly shaken for several hours mr krakauer wrote the shock of encountering the second wore off almost immediately yet if familiarity modulated the public 's response difference ensured that that response was substantial how people judge the significance of a death depends on its context said dr george loewenstein a professor of psychology and economics at carnegie mellon university the point of reference is important tell people that seven americans died on the highway in a single evening or that 50000 die that way each year and it will barely register tell them that seven teenagers died in a single car on a specific road and they will gather at memorial services give money write letters to city officials we care as much about proportions as we do about absolute numbers dr loewenstein said few go into space fewer still die there death that comes unexpectedly that occurs in startling circumstances that claims people with names we recognize receives more notice loss means more when it is has a name humans evolved to interact in small groups to mourn their relatives and neighbors on the saharan plain not the abstract victims of heart disease or the people who perished in a massacre thousands of miles away research subjects invited to share the profits of a coin toss with contestants who incorrectly called heads or tails give away more when the loser who will benefit is identified even if only by a number than when the loser remains anonymous dr loewenstein and his colleagues have found charities count on this unconscious emotional bond people are less likely to save children as a group than they are to save a particular child yet emotions developed to enhance the species survival keeping early humans one step in front of hungry lions sometimes mislead in the modern world dr loewenstein argues reason dictates that statistics matter that the deaths of tens of thousands merit more attention and more resources than the deaths of a few but to reach this conclusion requires a certain detachment a cool evaluation after a gut level response in the era of the sound bite and the human interest story of endless airtime waiting to be filled that assessment often does not take place symbols compel a response while substance is frequently ignored sympathy flows to those portrayed as the saddest the bravest the most beloved the masses though their need may be larger fend for themselves our emotional reactions to events are badly mistuned dr loewenstein said still rationality is unlikely ever to replace symbolic heft tragedy will never be defined solely by number perhaps that is not all bad when somebody dies in a bathtub accident it is the loss of a human being but not the loss of something symbolically very important to us dr gilbert said astronauts symbolize to us everything that 's good and noble in ourselves and our aspirations and our nation can the loss of seven astronauts be equated to the loss of seven other people his answer and that of millions of americans on saturday was not really
