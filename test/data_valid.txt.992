joe torre helped the yankees secure the free agent mike mussina last year by simply picking up the telephone and assuring the small town pitcher that not every inch of the metropolitan area is as bustling as manhattan mussina mentioned the importance of torre 's call to him in the opening moments of his introductory news conference with the yankees torre 's next phone friend might be jason giambi torre admitted that he would speed dial the 626 area code if the yankees determine giambi is the player they want at first base next season since it is probable that george steinbrenner the principal owner will pursue giambi to boost a sagging offense torre may want to hone his calling skills if that 's where we 're going sure i would torre said while sitting alone in his office at yankee stadium yesterday but i 'm not sure that 's where we 're going the yankees must soon decide whether they want giambi the offensive power hitter from the oakland athletics who won the american league 's most valuable player award last year and could win it again this year after winning their third straight championship last october the yankees made mussina their top priority and moved aggressively they obviously need an infusion of offense after a sluggish performance in the world series so they could follow the same aggressive pattern as they did with mussina and pursue the 30 year old giambi teams can not begin negotiations with free agents until nov 20 giambi was the leader of the a 's on and off the field presiding over a raucous clubhouse where players often acted as if it were a frat house one person who has spoken to giambi said that he was concerned about whether giambi 's free spirited personality would fit in with the staid atmosphere of the yankees clubhouse torre is not worried about that if something had to be cleared up with him on that i would do it torre said we never try to control anyone 's personality i think it 's important that everybody has to be what they are torre could point giambi to exhibit a david wells wells must be at least as boisterous as giambi and he flourished for two seasons with the yankees sure torre clashed with wells and some of wells 's teammates grew tired of the clubhouse doubling as a teenager 's bedroom on the days he started but the yankees won an unprecedented 125 games in 1998 with wells as their best pitcher of course the yankees other option at first base is tino martinez who is a superior defensive player to giambi and who would cost about half as much to sign martinez has been dependable for the yankees since 1996 and he had a strong year with 34 homers and 113 runs batted in while giambi will most likely want at least 18 million a year for six or seven years martinez 33 might be content with a three year commitment for much less still the yankees might not want to offer him three years i do n't think it 's a home team discount with the yankees martinez said i think it 's whether or not they want me back to help them win i do n't think they 're going to try to save money at first base i think they want to get the right person for the job whether it be me or someone else in an apparent reference to giambi 's eventual price tag martinez scoffed at the notion that his possible return was predicated on finances with the yankees does money really matter martinez said whatever they offer me i do n't know what it 's going to be if they even offer me anything they can go out and get whoever they want at 20 million a year when martinez was asked if he would be willing to return to the yankees if they first tried to sign giambi and failed he said he had not pondered that situation but then martinez apparently pondered it because he paused for several seconds that 's a tough question said martinez who never answered it one person familiar with the mets thinking said they would not be interested in trying to sign martinez unless they could unload todd zeile or robin ventura how would martinez feel about a call from manager bobby valentine i 'd have to see what he said martinez said laughing as martinez discussed his free agent status he mentioned torre 's call to mussina as the kind of gesture that would impact him maybe giambi would feel the same way as martinez thinks he would feel and as mussina felt last year when a manager like joe torre calls and tells you he wants you to be a part of winning a championship that goes a long way martinez said torre said it would be easier to call a player who has already played for him like martinez than a player the yankees could be courting like giambi because he would not have to do as much of a sales pitch until the off season starts humming torre will not know whose number he needs i 'd love to have tino back because he 's tried and proven and it 's not easy playing here torre said again he 's a free agent where do you go here i do n't know i really do n't know
