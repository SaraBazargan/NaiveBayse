when marty liquori became the third high school miler to break four minutes in the 1960 's he remembered calling his coach and saying this is great and all that but i wonder who will do it next year to which fred dwyer who coached him at essex catholic in newark replied no this is going to be very unusual how unusual dwyer could not have known liquori ran 3 minutes 598 seconds on june 23 1967 in bakersfield calif carried along by the world record pace of jim ryun in the 33 years since then not a single schoolboy miler has breached four minutes a particular lapse that symbolizes the general decline of american distance running the next serious mile challenge will come tomorrow night in charlotte nc when alan webb a searing junior from south lakes high in reston va attempts to accomplish what only ryun liquori and tim danielson have done in their pre college careers run four times around a track with a pace below one minute a lap forty six years after roger bannister became the first runner to go under four minutes the mile retains a certain magic it is seldom run anymore but it remains the last holdout against the metric onslaught with its familiar measurement of yards and feet and its requirement of enervating resourcefulness the 1500 meters at least retains olympic familiarity as the metric mile but the distance run frequently in high school is the 1600 while the 1600 is closer in length to the mile just slightly less it is a distance with no emotional resonance the mile is that combination of speed and endurance for a long enough period of time that if you happen to blink you wo n't miss the race as you would in a short sprint said ryun now a republican member of the united states house of representatives from kansas it 's a distance people can identify with one of the things that has hurt us is we felt we had to go to the metric system it confuses people about distance the 1600 meters is not a mile just what is it living in suburban washington the 5 foot 8 inch 140 pound webb has twice met ryun who ran the mile under four minutes five times while in high school in wichita kan his national schoolboy record of 3 553 still stands after 35 years last year webb broke ryun 's sophomore class record with a time of 4 0694 last month at the penn relays the 17 year old webb ran a 1600 meter leg of the sprint medley relay in 3 599 which converts to a 4 0103 mile ryun advised webb to stick to his own training program and told him to surround himself with people who will help him facilitate his dream instead of telling him it will be impossible to achieve he also cautioned that the ability to handle mental pressures will be as challenging as the physical requirements to run under four minutes webb 's workouts indicate that he is on target he has recently run 8x800 meters in descending order from 2 14 to 1 55 on 2 3 minutes rest and 12x400 meters in 58 59 seconds with 30 45 seconds rest between each lap he said 'if you think you can do it do n't hesitate webb said of ryun he said when he was younger some people said 'you should wait until you 're older to really push he told me not to hold back i think i 'm ready why has n't a high schooler broken four minutes in three decades there are many theories training has evolved from high mileage to long slow distance some coaches feel it is child abuse to make guys run 80 miles a week liquori said compulsory physical education has lapsed while increased opportunities to compete in other sports such as soccer and lacrosse have siphoned potential distance stars the awarding of college scholarships to foreign runners has diminished the motivation of american high schoolers i think in the 60 's there was a different work ethic in which young athletes recognized that you had to invest a certain amount of time to arrive at a destination ryun said today it 's more like 'i want it now instant gratification webb appears to have two things in his favor aside from immense talent first his coach scott raczko is a former runner at american university and not a football coach who works with track in the spring he has webb training between 40 and 55 miles a week and is careful not to over race him and to allow for sufficient rest and recovery second webb appears not to be obsessed with four minutes as a barrier his ambition this season is to run even faster breaking ryun 's junior national record of 3 59 and achieving the 3 5814 he would need to qualify for the olympic trials at 1500 meters in july i think what has hurt some of the kids who tried in the 90 's was just that the four minute mile raczko said it 's a mental thing if you 're driven just to get to four minutes you 're in trouble four minutes is not a barrier for alan he is shooting for 3 58 so he 's confident about 4 00 so confident and determined that he is skipping his high school prom tonight to rest for tomorrow 's race only 46 years ago they were saying it was physically impossible for humans to run under four minutes webb said that 's the coolest thing about all this it 's why i get excited it 's the only thing that makes 3 59 anything more than taking five seconds off my best time it was n't that long ago that they thought no one could do it
