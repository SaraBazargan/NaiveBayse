touched down at charles de gaulle early yesterday morning to the eye opening headlines that venus williams and jennifer capriati had exited the singles draw of the french open on sunday furthering my growing belief that significant change is in the air on the women 's tennis tour working on her run of titles in four grand slam events serena williams will be front and center today against the frenchwoman amelie mauresmo but papa richard 's realized dream of his daughters divvying up the spoils of the sport like a couple of cooperative warlords may have already passed its peak even factoring in the havoc red clay often wreaks an era that once seemed built to last may already be over or ova given sunday 's sudden rise of the young russians vera zvonareva and nadia petrova venus williams has n't looked anything like the player who ruled the tour before her sister 's ascendance capriati for her part has lost the edge that catapulted her from career infamy the recently married lindsay davenport who also went out in the fourth round sunday seems to have caught a serious case of real life stuff happens serena has happened the gallant monica seles has aching feet that are taking her in the direction of the retired martina hingis who climbed down from her horse and dropped in on roland garros last week for a social call nothing more hingis the devilish foil for the williams sisters when she was able to compete with them is probably gone for good a few other household names may be in a slow fade but there was a vision yesterday both retro and regal in the chiseled person of martina navratilova madame serve and volley coddled and cajoled yet another hard hitting russian svetlana kuznetsova to the finish of a gritty 6 4 3 6 7 5 loss against chanda rubin and daniela hantuchova in doubles something of an upset based on 2003 form navratilova 46 and kuznetsova 17 have been much more than a novelty act this year winning four tournaments and thus inspiring mothers and daughters everywhere to bond in case you missed it navratilova also won the mixed doubles at the australian open with leander paes of india for a remarkable twist of fate as of now martina the elder can brag that she is the holder of a grand slam title later than her namesake hingis a woman slightly less than half her age fatherhood and the ability to savor 14 grand slam titles appear to have pushed pete sampras into a happy state of stay at home hood andre agassi says the only reason he 's still at it in the quarterfinals here today is that he took much time off for postadolescent behavior during his 20 's professional tennis is a grueling head spinning grind one that navratilova tired of in 1994 at 37 but returned to in 2000 unable to resist the temptation to test her reflexes on the doubles courts she and pam shriver long owned she is not out here trying to market herself like michael jordan navratilova 's declared lesbianism and habit of political outspokenness long ago made commercialization as likely a career path as space travel few champions ever get the chance to play for the joy of it navratilova is only saying if i can do it why not the reward she never counted on was the baby boomers taking her message to heart thanking her for inspiring them to get on the bicycle or go kick a soccer ball for themselves they 're going 'martina we love you i ca n't believe what you still do navratilova said you should see these women at the country clubs middle aged women straight women straight women her entourage from her halcyon days is scaled down a full time trainer and a coach for grand slam events at least they are hers alone the williams sisters share everything an arrangement navratilova ca n't imagine when no 2 is trying to solve the mystery of no 1 that is venus williams 's conundrum and maybe her undoing many people navratilova included wonder if her heart is in tennis anymore but how can it be whole when venus as big sister appears bound by love and by unofficial family rules from mounting the appropriate counterattack as martina did against chris evert and vice versa they have the same trainer same coach same hitting partner navratilova said what venus does need to do maybe is get another coach if she wants to beat serena again maybe disconnecting in the final analysis will be easier pat riley 's old adage winning or misery has always seemed to me like a perfect fit for tennis given its numbing repetition enervating travel physical demands and unrelenting loneliness in the heat of competition when john mcenroe finally solved bjorn borg borg 's response was to get out somebody needs to slow serena williams otherwise some of her most well known peers maybe venus most of all may give up the chase and leave it to the next crop of youngsters the young russians among them to figure her out
