mike piazza apologized three times in 10 minutes for being too philosophical but the mets have been so dreary and disappointing that he has been forced to be more introspective piazza has spent endless hours trying to determine what has gone wrong what he could have done differently and how he can help make the mets vibrant again piazza 's emotions have fluctuated during the first six weeks of this underachieving mets season from frustration to anger to sadness to depression there has been only a smattering of days that he would even label as cheery before the mets tumbled to the padres 5 2 at chilly shea stadium last night piazza was feeling liberated the heck with retracing the ugly spate of losses and focusing on the many negatives been there for a month and a half done that for just as long piazza said he actually looked in the mirror saw someone who was miserable and decided to become mr positive being annoyed will not help piazza conquer his batting slump or help the mets resurrect themselves i think there comes a time where you just get to a point at least for me personally where you say 'i 'm sick and tired of feeling sorry for myself and for the team piazza said no matter what happens i want to come to the ballpark feeling positive i want to come here and no matter who i have playing behind me we 're going to bust our butts for three hours you do that and you leave everything else to chance piazza had the chance to boost the mets a chance to make those three hours of work much more pleasurable and actually give them a two game winning streak but with the mets trailing by two runs and a runner on in the eighth inning piazza flailed futilely at adam eaton 's 2 2 cut fastball piazza banged his bat against his cleat after the whiff as the mets faltered for the seventh time in eight games i really do n't know what the pitch was that i struck out on piazza said i know it moved it was a great pitch eaton noticed that he surprised piazza i threw him a couple of good cutters eaton said i do n't think he knew i had it after torturing himself piazza recalled how roy campanella called him over for a lecture eight years ago in vero beach fla campanella a three time mvp knew there would be serious expectations for piazza the rookie and gazing up from his wheelchair simply and eloquently told piazza to always remember what was important he just told me 'just play the game just play baseball just keep it a game piazza said sometimes that 's difficult especially in new york you have a lot of expectations and the first thing that happens when you get frustrated is people ask you what 's gone wrong and what 's going wrong you get bombarded you start to finger point piazza said he thought about what campanella had told him at least once every two weeks but that has multiplied in the last two weeks while piazza said the mets had not blamed one another they were obviously concerned about a season that is quickly deteriorating they held a players only meeting on tuesday and followed with a 1 0 victory over the padres but as last night displayed they are a long way from a cure piazza knows that he belted two singles before the crucial strikeout but is still only 6 for his last 41 manager bobby valentine said piazza was not seeing many good pitches in part because robin ventura and todd zeile are not scaring pitchers and was standing straight up at the plate by not bending his front knee valentine said piazza is not taking that piazza swing then valentine imitated piazza 's swing and even grunted as an imaginary ball disappeared from shea if only piazza could solve his problem that easily like piazza valentine is waiting if he is all right and he bats 330 we 're going to win a lot of ballgames valentine said that 's what i expect so does piazza but he is puzzled by his latest drought piazza does not believe in watching videotapes of previous at bats and he hits by feel he felt pressured to do too much so he is bagging any negative self analysis i do n't want to come here in a bad mood anymore piazza said i 'm going to be positive no matter who we have out there no matter how many mistakes we make and how many times we do n't execute you still have to believe we 're going to win when we 're able to get that vibe going we 've shown we can win we were almost world champs last year i think that 's all within you is it the mets do not look like a team that has a prayer of reaching the postseason never mind the world series they need to take baby steps even to get back to 500 and piazza must lead an offense that had scored the fewest runs 140 in the national league going into last night piazza acknowledged that he deserved more of blame than his teammates did because he is the 91 million catcher the new mr positive even tried to turn that into a positive there are very few players who have that expectation on them every day so it 's flattering piazza said if i can take pressure off the other guys like bobby does you can turn a negative into a positive people think you get paid to hit home runs but there are a lot of other responsibilities piazza laughed and added i 'd like to hit homers though it 's a lot better than struggling
