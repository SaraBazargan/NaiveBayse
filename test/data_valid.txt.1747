to the editor i read the article on the renaissance of the area around grand central terminal around grand central new office towers and a 54 floor residence feb 13 with great interest i am a member of disabled in action an activist and civil rights organization people like me in wheelchairs and scooters find it particularly difficult to navigate a wide radius of blocks in the area around grand central terminal because there are few curb cuts called pedestrian ramps in department of transportation jargon when i tried to get to the mta headquarters at 345 madison avenue it took some backtracking dangerously jumping a curb at vanderbilt and literally going in the street with my scooter ahead of a parade of cars while we waited for a crane to move a girder and then i led the line to the next corner i was shocked i expected an area that is so developed to have accommodations for everyone who walks shops or passes through it i invite the powerful people who own design and develop the properties and buildings in the grand central area to either make curb cuts themselves or force the mayor and the city to create curb cuts on every corner oh what you could do jean meyers ryan disabled in action of metropolitan new york manhattan
