spurs coach gregg popovich wanted to relish the moment he wanted to go on and on about what he and his improbable band of champions had accomplished four measly questions were not enough that 's all i get to do popovich said late sunday night flummoxed when his postgame news conference went silent after san antonio beat the nets 88 77 to win the nba title i won a championship i 'm loving this i thought i 'd be here 30 minutes or so more questions how many times is this going to happen do i look like phil jackson this is popovich he had plenty of reasons to be giddy and not only because he had guided the spurs to their second nba championship in five years the circumstances of this title run and the makeup of his title team had made the achievement that much sweeter when the spurs broke training camp last october they were not making plans to hoist a championship trophy nine months later sure they had tim duncan who would go on to win his second consecutive most valuable player award but the rest of the spurs including 37 year old david robinson were believed to be either too old or too young to mesh into the league 's pre eminent team at one end of the spectrum were kevin willis 40 steve kerr 37 danny ferry 36 and steve smith 34 a battle scarred veteran who was starting for the spurs at the beginning of the season on the other end were tony parker 21 the starting point guard who was two years removed from playing in france manu ginobili 25 a rookie from argentina speedy claxton 25 a third year player who was known for quickness but little else and stephen jackson 25 a journeyman who had seemingly shot hoops and been cut in every corner of the world in between were duncan 27 the underappreciated defender bruce bowen 22 and malik rose 28 a 6 foot 7 power forward who was always considered too small to do anything really special nba champs coming from the competitive western conference in october the spurs might have been happy to make it deep into the playoffs the plan was to get the spurs youngsters some experience put up a valiant postseason fight against the los angeles lakers or the sacramento kings and then sign a superstar free agent after robinson retired but parker became a force albeit an inconsistent one jackson embraced the team concept and blossomed as the starting shooting guard and ginobili proved more electric than anyone expected suddenly the spurs were accelerating toward 60 victories and with the lakers bumbling the standard rose i 'm thrilled for our players popovich 54 said our young guys obviously came together a lot quicker than any of us would have imagined or than we expected ourselves in the beginning of the year so it 's been sort of a magical ride popovich was named the nba 's coach of the year after guiding his varied group to the league 's best record but even after such a successful regular season he was not certain his players could go this far it is an eclectic group popovich said they are all the strangest backgrounds you can imagine on the planet both individually and basketball wise that 's why even at the beginning of the playoffs we did n't know where we were going to be this season because there were so many unanswered questions there is one common thread they 're all very competitive they 're all tough minded they all get after each other every day in practice and they do have that competitive gene in their bodies duncan who became only the ninth player to win the regular season and finals mvp awards in the same season was clearly the leader of the spurs championship run but his supporting cast should not be overlooked robinson went out on as high a note as possible recording 13 points 17 rebounds and 2 blocked shots in his last game and amazingly during the 19 0 fourth quarter run that turned a 72 63 spurs deficit into an 82 72 lead sunday duncan did not score a point jackson who committed six turnovers in the first three quarters of game 6 buried three 3 pointers in a span of 2 minutes 22 seconds claxton leading the spurs on a 41 20 run while playing the final 17 23 sank two jump shots during the spurt duncan who had 21 points 20 rebounds 10 assists and 8 blocked shots was the quarterback of the offense during the rally with three assists he also anchored the defense during the run with two blocked shots the run which lasted 5 10 was reminiscent of the 23 0 second half spurt san antonio had in closing out dallas in game 6 of the western conference finals the spurs have some decisions to make in the off season in free agency do they pursue jason kidd when they already have a talented potentially great point guard in parker or do they try to replace robinson on the front line by luring players like the pacers jermaine o'neal or the clippers elton brand do they re sign claxton a free agent who will command a higher salary and perhaps a starting job elsewhere the best bet is that popovich and general manager rc buford will make the right moves and have san antonio in position to repeat those guys have done an incredible job of getting players and putting them on the floor and giving us a chance to win duncan said of spurs management we 'll fill a void and we 'll find a way to hopefully get back here that is more than the spurs were saying last october
