the right eye belonging to the most penetrating pair in professional basketball looked much better yesterday but still fell under the descriptive category of discolored and misshapen the status of jason kidd for game 4 of the eastern conference semifinal today will be the nets say a game time decision if he does n't play then anthony johnson will start at point guard but kenyon martin the nets second best player must ascend to a higher competitive place i have to step up be a leader he said for the nets sake that means not with his forearms but with his head martin could not bear to look at kidd after his frightful collision in game 3 with the hornets david wesley i did n't want to go down there martin said of where kidd had fallen blood spurting from the wound above his right eye any reason i just did n't want to martin said maybe it was the scare of something potentially debilitating befalling a player the nets had thought to be as indestructibly reliable as he is valuable maybe martin recently cast as the muscled man on the cover of sports illustrated with a tattooed message more commonly associated with a convict has a squeamish side he sure was n't about to admit it not here not now with the hornets pushing hard to stay in the series and making martin look bad or not so bad in rocky balboa lingo all these years after the young andre agassi shot a vacuous commercial that declared image is everything posturing preening and pretending have become the face of professional sports with help from editors who decry hostility in text but promote it with photos martin let his first fling with national cover boy fame become a virtual endorsement of the frequent flagrant fouler which for months he insisted he was n't it is a fine line these powerful young men straddle separating welcome aggression from wanton violence and especially in the playoff heat that they are sent mixed messages from those who try to manipulate with machismo creates the riddle of playing extra hard without making life impossibly difficult typically coaches who overcoach make it worse it 's one thing to coin a clever phrase as pat riley did when as the lakers coach he said no rebounds no rings it is another thing to elevate the issue of effort to a struggle for one 's manhood i always believed that riley and jeff van gundy were accomplices to the crimes of physicality committed by their players during the knicks miami scrums byron scott a proud disciple of riley his former coach with the lakers is confronted with motivating his front line players and especially the dynamic but sometimes self destructive martin to meet the challenge of the bruising hornets big men without unleashing martin 's dark side in game 3 they pounded us they dominated us scott said using words he surely repeated behind closed doors the best way for the hornets to win this series is to wear the nets down history has taught scott that the longer a seven game playoff series goes the better the odds get for the bigger more physical team though it is not crucial today 's game does represent the nets last chance for a quick finish that is their dilemma as they contemplate using kidd who clearly indicated yesterday that he was hoping to get medical clearance granted kidd with one eye open is more visionary than most point guards but if there is even the suspicion that his peripheral vision is not 100 percent he must be held back obviously if he does n't have all his vision he ca n't be jason kidd scott said knowing further injury would jeopardize kidd for the wednesday home game the nets might have to win should they lose today given the question of kidd 's effectiveness or even his availability the strong presence that martin has not yet been in this series is vital his team is still ahead still in control he said he wishes people would stop talking about charlotte 's jamaal magloire 16 points and 6 blocks in game 3 like he 's wilt chamberlain man of the hornets game 3 rebounding martin said ok well they did it for one game actually in three games against the hornets martin has a grand total of 11 rebounds one offensive after indiana 's jermaine o'neal torched the nets for 30 points in game 1 of the first round martin asked for the assignment and the rest of the series belonged to him of course the pacers most physically threatening attribute was reggie miller 's mouth these hornets are a bruising bunch right on down to their undersized guards the hard headed wesley and linebacker like baron davis there was a lot of pushing a lot of shoving scott said we have to answer the challenge during a contentious playoff game that fine line between aggression and violence can shift in a heartbeat martin 's cockiness generally serves him well but he must keep his cool against a hard hat team playing what could be the last nba game at charlotte coliseum kenyon has to play with emotion with aggression said rod thorn the nets architect whose previous job was in the league office where he meted out punishment for those occasions when as he said a player uses his arms like an ax he added kenyon understands he ca n't afford a mistake one lapse that allows the preening cover boy in martin to emerge could get him suspended and leave a gash on the nets front line that no doctor can stitch leadership jason kidd style is keeping the big picture in focus
