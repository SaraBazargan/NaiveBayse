mergers are never easy especially when one side does not want the other now a state judge in delaware where many companies are incorporated has put a new twist on the challenge by ordering a merger in which one side no longer wants the other on june 15 leo e strine jr a vice chancellor of the delaware chancery court ruled that tyson foods the nation 's largest poultry producer must complete its 32 billion acquisition of ibp tyson had withdrawn from the deal saying that ibp a leading beef producer was no longer desirable because of accounting irregularities assuming that the judge 's ruling stands the big challenge for the two companies is figuring out how to get along can they mitchell lee marks a psychologist and consultant who helps merging companies integrate spoke last week about whether the shotgun marriage of tyson and ibp can succeed andrew ross sorkin q what is the top priority for tyson 's chairman and chief executive john h tyson a first he has to establish credibility in the eyes of ibp employees as well as his own employees he lays the facts on the line i think he does that by saying look we did n't want you but now that we have you here 's how we think we can make it work in other words do n't pretend that he loves you all along because that was n't the case i think the impression has to be straightforward and honest to establish himself as a credible source so down the road when further communications come out people believe him rather than say well what do you expect him to say this is not just another event for tyson this is something that either years from now people are going to look back and say gosh we integrated into one company or they 're going to always see this orphan child in the company q how should ibp employees react a ibp employees should be in shock that 's perfectly normal and healthy they should be angry at their leadership for selling them out they should be angry at tyson 's leadership for putting them through this ringer those are legitimate normal psychological reactions but they ca n't let these emotions control them q if you 're an ibp employee what should you be doing to ensure your position in the combined company a they have to toe a line between promoting themselves and not becoming obnoxious to the other side if there are opportunities to get on transition teams jump at that they usually have high visibility do n't wait for the other side to ask how you do things maybe you can find out who does what you do at the reorganization and contact them and talk to them about different ways of approaching things in most mergers people feel they should n't talk to the other side that just persists the us versus them dynamics tyson should be making overtures to get the two sides to learn about one another but if that 's not the case then ibp people have to be a little proactive q is there a rule of thumb about what type of employees quit in a merger is that something ibp employees might consider a it 's usually the good folks who want to jump ship they 're the ones that are most confident but also they 're the ones most worried that the new owners wo n't know their track records they perceive themselves as having the most to lose q how long do you expect a merger of the companies not just the businesses but the people to take a the least amount of time would be a year psychologically you have to let go of the old before you accept the new this is something that executives do n't consider when they make their integration timetables executives have been thinking for months about the deal then they announce it during that time they were letting go of the old now employees hear the news if i 'm an ibp employee i 'm not going to able to go through my own transition until i know what my job is usually several months down the road so only when i hear what my fate is can i begin the process of letting go
