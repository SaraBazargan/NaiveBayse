racing back and forth at a frantic pace the nets and the dallas mavericks pressed on toward the final buzzer for 43 minutes tonight the nets held the best team in the league with three all stars well below its offensive norm but it was only a matter of time before one of them then another locked in on the basket and it was only a matter of time the final five minutes before the nets made small mistakes and missed their shots following a familiar pattern with 6 minutes 42 seconds to play the nets were ahead by 2 points when the mavs slithery point guard steve nash tied the score with a driving layup dirk nowitzki cracked the tie for dallas with a layup and followed with a 3 pointer over kenyon martin as the nets missed five straight shots and turned the ball over twice the mavericks proved why they remain the best team in the league taking an 88 79 victory over the nets in front of a sellout crowd of 19920 at american airlines center we were in the ballgame with two minutes left point guard jason kidd said the nets were actually down by just 3 points when nash 's reverse layup fell with 2 04 to play kidd added we just could n't get baskets when we had the opportunity and we did n't get the stops but we gave the effort again we 're so close but still so far we still have our work cut out for us the nets who have lost five of their last six games play in san antonio on thursday against the spurs who hope to woo kidd as a free agent this summer since the all star game the nets 38 23 have won only 4 of 12 games and their atlantic division lead is down to three games over philadelphia this was not the beginning they had wanted for a daunting trip but it was hardly surprising the mavericks 46 14 have owned the nets in the past three seasons winning six straight the longest streak any team in the league has against the nets after tonight 's game nets coach byron scott and his players tried to dwell on the positive their defense held the mavericks below their average of 1031 points which is the best in the nba any time you hold dallas to 88 points you 've done a pretty good job because they have so much firepower scott said even though it was a loss and it was no consolation we did a lot of good things the two negatives for us tonight were missing free throws and turning over the ball the nets who had 24 turnovers in losing to the jazz had 23 tonight the mavs converted them into 23 points at the free throw line the nets missed 8 of 19 we play the best defense i think we could lucious harris said we could have cut down on our turnovers and made our free throws but the better team won if we play like this i 'm sure we 're going to win some games on this trip in the end the nets could not stop nash or nowitzki but they did not lose on a heartbreaking buzzer beater as they did sunday against utah nash and nowitzki each scored 24 points nash had 11 in the fourth quarter and nowitzki scored 7 5 of them during a crucial stretch great players make great plays toward the end of the game scott said that 's where the nets seem to be breaking down lately you 've got to be able to win and execute with two minutes left and we did n't do that tonight kidd said attributing that to a young team it 's not shot selection kidd said it 's small details of understanding you do n't have to be in a rush and at the same time you have to play defense martin playing in front of 54 friends and family members from his hometown led the nets with 18 points kidd who made only 5 of 15 shots scored 13 points as did aaron williams after dallas tied the score at 75 75 the nets missed their next 12 shots richard jefferson their second year forward missed two layups and a jump shot and turned the ball over we played hard we played tough defense they just made shots when they needed to martin said the nets eroded a 9 point deficit with 2 58 to play in the third quarter and the mavs led by only 60 58 going into the fourth quarter once in 23 games at home this season have the mavs lost when taking a lead into the fourth quarter the sign of a confident team with a battalion of talent now the nets move along through the quicksand that could be this texas trip you 're going to san antonio that 's no easy place to play either scott said and they 're playing as well as any team in the league rebounds anthony johnson has been the primary backup to jason kidd with the nets trying to negotiate a buyout with chris childs on tuesday night though johnson played only 10 minutes and had 2 points on three shots with two turnovers kidd played all but two minutes of the second half
