india announced tonight that it was ending its unilateral cease fire in kashmir and said that prime minister atal behari vajpayee would invite pakistan 's military ruler gen pervez musharraf to restart negotiations between the two hostile nuclear powers talks came to a sudden halt two years ago after fierce fighting broke out in kashmir the himalayan territory both claim india said it was again offering the hand of friendship reconciliation cooperation and peace to pakistan and pakistani officials said tonight that general musharraf who bestowed on himself the title of chief executive when he took power in a coup in october 1999 would accept the invitation to visit india the chief executive has more than once said that he is ready to meet and hold talks with the indian leadership anywhere any time pakistan 's foreign secretary said on pakistan 's state television india 's decision to couple the invitation to the general with the end of the cease fire acknowledging tonight that the one sided effort had failed to bring peace to the long suffering kashmiris mollified mr vajpayee 's hard line supporters in the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party they have felt the cease fire was giving the militants too much time to rest up and consolidate hereafter security forces shall take action against terrorists as they judge best said jaswant singh india 's minister of external affairs the prime minister 's decision to invite the general for talks was completely unexpected it was not clear why he chose to do this now whatever his reasons the talks in new delhi will not necessarily diminish the violence in kashmir the beautiful land that has been at the root of two of the three wars that india and pakistan have fought during the past half century india contends that pakistan sponsors muslim militants in kashmir who are battling indian rule there and who have continued to commit what india calls terrorist acts during the cease fire but pakistan says it provides only political and moral support to these groups in an interview last week with a british newspaper gen musharraf dismissed india 's kashmir cease fire as a farce meant for the consumption of the west the poisonous issue of kashmir will lie at the heart of any talks between india and pakistan no one expects the problem to yield to a quick settlement predominantly hindu india founded on ideas of secularism considers majority muslim kashmir one of its 28 states while pakistan an islamic country holds that kashmiris should be allowed to vote on whether to merge with pakistan in its talks with pakistan indian negotiators have often maintained that the two countries should start small and reach agreement on less emotionally charged issues before tackling kashmir while pakistanis want kashmir front and center this pattern will almost certainly continue if the meeting between prime minister vajpayee and general musharraf takes place mr singh the indian minister said tonight that the talks would proceed as part of the so called lahore process that started in february 1999 when mr vajpayee ventured to pakistan and embraced nawaz sharif the pakistani prime minister who was toppled in a coup later that year the two prime ministers had agreed that kashmir would be one of the issues taken up along with trade visa rules and other matters it was this so called lahore process that was aborted two years ago just months after mr vajpayee 's visit to pakistan when there was a raid into the mountainous kargil section of kashmir that is controlled by india india said that pakistani soldiers crossed into indian territory and occupied indian land a version that the united states has supported pakistan said the men were militants acting on their own it was this raid that derailed the talks between the two countries who both began nuclear underground tests three years ago and left india with a deep feeling of having been tricked by pakistan general musharraf still denies that the pakistani army played any role in the kargil fiasco he has repeatedly asked india to go back to the negotiating table during the past year but he has also said over and over that he has no patience for talks that do not immediately take on the problem of kashmir a stance that a pakistani spokesman for the ministry of information reiterated in a telephone interview tonight there is no question of talking about anything else but kashmir because that is the basic problem between india and pakistan he said it is meaningless to talk about trade and other issues
