the new york city board of education did the city and its public school students a service yesterday by bringing the search for an interim chancellor to a speedy conclusion presented with two solid candidates the board in a narrow 4 to 3 vote chose harold levy a businessman with a proven interest in public education to serve until a permanent replacement is found for the recently departed rudy crew mr levy appears to have had the edge partly because of his democratic party connections and partly because he has more educational experience the board was within its rights to stand up to political pressure from mayor rudolph giuliani whose preferred candidate was robert kiley the mayor 's nervousness about mr levy 's political ties is understandable but mr giuliani 's combative reaction to this political defeat was not an encouraging sign for the future both sides need to move forward in the spirit of cooperation both mr kiley and mr levy offered exemplary records as managers and public servants mr kiley currently president of the new york city partnership earned his reputation as chairman of the metropolitan transportation authority which he helped rescue from collapse in the 1980 's mr levy the director of global compliance for citigroup has an impressive business record and more experience with education he is a member of the state board of regents where he has played an integral role in developing the new graduation standards that are being phased in throughout the state between 1995 and 1998 he served on what has come to be known as the levy commission which restructured the school construction authority and documented the dilapidated state of the city 's schools mr giuliani complained that the vote was dictated by the unions the mayor also attacked terri thomson the school board member from queens who provided the decisive swing vote he argued that she voted along political lines even though ms thomson sided with the mayor to remove mr crew just days ago most new yorkers would like to hear less about these rivalries and more about what to do about the city 's beleaguered school children it is especially imperative that the schools not become a pawn in anyone 's political campaign including mr giuliani 's quest for the senate and the campaign by the school board president william thompson jr for city comptroller for that and other reasons richard mills the commissioner of the state education department needs to move quickly to assemble the special panel that is required by law to approve mr levy 's appointment then with the interim chancellor in place the board needs to cast the widest possible net to find a permanent replacement
