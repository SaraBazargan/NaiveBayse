it 's not that macho uno was n't around last year he just did n't make much of an impact with one victory from four starts that coming in a grade iii stakes race he did n't exactly follow through on the promise he showed in a brilliant 2 year old campaign that ended with a victory in the 2000 breeders cup juvenile but a year later he appears ready to rewrite the story of his career coming off a one and three quarters length victory in the massachusetts handicap at suffolk downs where he impressively overcame what appeared to be an impenetrable traffic jam macho uno will most likely be favored in saturday 's 500000 suburban handicap at belmont among the highlights of a busy holiday weekend of racing another victory would raise his 2002 record to 3 for 3 and push him a big step closer to the goal of the owner frank stronach 's adena springs stable horse of the year i have been waiting for a long time for everyone to see how good he is the trainer joe orseno said with his maturity and his development he has come so far from 2 to 3 to 4 now that he 's a 4 year old he accepts everything he was studdish when he was younger now he knows what he has to do and he goes out and he does it that did not seem to be the case last year suffering from nothing more serious than growing pains macho uno did not make any of the triple crown races orseno did not get him started until a july 25 allowance at saratoga which he lost by a nose and he was never quite able to catch up after a victory in the pennsylvania derby he was beaten at odds of 1 5 in the ohio derby before finishing fourth in the breeders cup classic it was not necessarily a bad effort but it did not keep him from being regarded as one of the year 's more notable disappointments if we ran him in the kentucky derby he would n't be what he is today orseno said he 'd be at stud it was a maturity thing his bones were growing faster than they needed to be we needed to give him time to grow into himself hopefully we 'll be rewarded for it this year always patient with his horses orseno started macho uno 's current campaign with an allowance victory on march 23 at gulfstream but it was the massachusetts handicap on june 1 that signaled that 2002 could turn out to be a special year for the son of holy bull facing a quality group of older horses he nearly came to a stop in midstretch when the jockey gary stevens found himself hopelessly blocked stevens nearly twisted his mount sideways to get him to angle to the outside and macho uno responded with an explosive burst of acceleration that carried him to the victory this is not the same horse as before stevens said afterward he is strong and powerful in the past he had been hot before the race and you would have to finesse him but today my 10 year old daughter would have been able to ride him because he was like a saddle horse the field for the suburban will include lido palace a horse of the year candidate last year after winning the whitney and the woodward he has done little since though finishing eighth in the japan cup and fourth in the san antonio handicap on feb 3 at santa anita his only start this year lido palace and macho uno are both scheduled to make the whitney on aug 3 at saratoga where they could meet the divisional leader street cry owned by godolphin racing street cry was expected to make the suburban but his connections wanted to give him more time after he won the stephen foster on june 15 at churchill downs street cry and macho uno could turn out to be the main contenders for the older male championship none of the 3 year olds in the dwyer at belmont on sunday will have championship aspirations a race that was supposed to begin the comeback of buddha the wood memorial winner it will instead feature a small cast of horses hoping to emerge as viable candidates for races like the haskell and the travers buddha who missed the kentucky derby with a bruised hoof started coughing earlier this week and was pulled from the race by his trainer jim bond he will point instead for the jim dandy at saratoga on aug 4 in his place the likely dwyer favorite will be gygistar a lightly raced gelding who captured the riva ridge on belmont day bigger challenges await including possible meetings with war emblem the kentucky derby and preakness winner and sarava the belmont winner the connections of those horses have not yet decided where they will run next but the travers is likely to be on their schedules
