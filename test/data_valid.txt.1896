two numbers seem to define the political fortunes of chancellor gerhard schroder as he heads to new york on thursday for meetings intended to convince american businessmen that germany is back at least economically the first number is 808 the impressive percentage of the vote by which his social democratic party re elected him leader on monday the margin of victory came despite deep unease within his electoral constituency about the economic reforms that he has made central to his second four year term the second number related to that unease is 24 and it is the dismal rating his party got in a recent national poll which is about the poorest showing the party has ever made federal elections will not be held until 2006 and in the meantime mr schroder in the view of at least some analysts here has put into place a program that could in the end help him prevail certainly he seems to have overcome resistance to his reforms which would curtail cherished social democratic programs like generous pensions within his own party in other ways too he shows strong signs of outmaneuvering the conservative figures who would like to replace him mr schroder has been looking strong in foreign policy as well including in relations with the united states which a few months ago were about as bad as they have ever been since world war ii with the chancellor and the american president basically not on speaking terms it was icy at the top karsten d voigt the coordinator for german american cooperation in the german foreign ministry said in an interview i think it has changed to what ought to be normal no doubt the united states would still like germany to make more of a contribution in iraq dispatching troops and donating more money for reconstruction but relations have improved because of reportedly cordial encounters between mr bush and mr schroder and because of what is seen here as successful cooperation on such matters as afghanistan where germany has the second biggest contingent of troops after the united states and confronting iran over its nuclear program the underlying reason for this in the view of mr voigt and other german officials is that the disagreement about iraq has been replaced by a common view regarding the necessity to prevent instability in iraq from spreading elsewhere in the middle east whether germany in this sense is making as much of a contribution as it should is a matter of sharp disagreement here so far germany is pledging about 200 million for iraqi reconstruction and has said it will train iraqi police and soldiers but it continues to refuse to send german troops to iraq the warming of germany 's most important alliance has come about without a major departure for mr schroder from his early opposition to the war in iraq the relationship is good bela anda mr schroder 's spokesman said in an interview the chancellor has always made it clear that being political friends we have to be able to be in a different position from time to time mr anda continued but it 's now a matter of looking forward with our american friends to meet the big challenges that we both face mr schroder 's position on the iraq war remains popular far more so than his vaunted program of economic reform
