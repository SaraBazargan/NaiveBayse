in challenging the united nations last fall to join in the attack on saddam hussein president bush did not say you 're with us or against us he said something far more shrewd either you 're with us or you 're irrelevant that has been the standing warning ever since put most bluntly by secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld when he dismissed the two big holdouts france and germany as old europe sure we 'll consult you president bush told the world in his state of the union address but let there be no misunderstanding we 're going in with you or without you if measured by the way the world was lining up last week the approach has been effective in september when the administration began to talk seriously about going after mr hussein the questions were whether this was necessary or productive or a vendetta the skepticism has not waned but most world leaders today are thinking less about how best to deal with mr hussein than about how to deal with an unstoppable superpower the open letter of support for washington from the leaders of eight european countries spain britain italy poland hungary the czech republic denmark and portugal which was published in the wall street journal last week talked far more about the importance of american leadership than the evil of iraq no misunderstanding here sir they seemed to be telling mr bush the letter followed hard on another boost for the administration 's case the surprisingly stern report by hans blix the chief united nations inspector for chemical and biological weapons instead of dwelling on his team 's failure to find much evidence of such weapons mr blix swung his weight behind washington 's main charge that iraq had shown no inclination to disarm iraq appears not to have come to genuine acceptance not even today of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and live in peace mr blix said reading a list of things iraq had not explained it hardly seemed to matter that nobody seriously expected mr hussein to lead inspectors to his stash of illegal poisons or rockets or to let his scientists tell all in the united nations corridors the discussion was no longer whether the evidence was compelling or whether france or germany had some telling points the talk was about when the war was likely to start and with whom united nations officials were already looking past a war expecting a major role in helping refugees and rebuilding iraq arab ambassadors pondered the dangers of allowing their streets to perceive the war as a clash of civilizations and spoke in hushed tones about the saudi idea convincing mr hussein to flee while he could very foolish the iraqi ambassador mohammed a aldouri said when this was put to him we 're on a different page now said a western diplomat as security council members left their chamber american diplomats barely concealed their satisfaction their brilliance all along is that they created the aura of inevitability said john j mearsheimer a political scientist at the university of chicago opponents throw up their hands and say it 's inevitable there was still no convincing evidence that iraq was in cahoots with al qaeda he said nor any compelling intelligence of active efforts to develop weapons polls around the world still showed deep skepticism about the need for war even in britain mr bush promised that secretary of state colin l powell would finally show the security council some real intelligence this wednesday but officials privately warned against expecting the sort of sensational show and tell that adlai e stevenson produced for the united nations 40 years ago to prove soviet missiles were in cuba france and germany were already saying that if mr powell did produce hard evidence this would be another reason to give the inspectors more time to follow it up other skeptics wondered why if the evidence was strong it had not been shown in short a hoopla was inevitable the diplomatic window the american ambassador john d negroponte told the security council is closing that an american official said was not a verbal flourish the entire security council he said had agreed to the resolution on iraq that was hammered out last november the resolution contained three central requirements that iraq cooperate fully with inspectors that the inspectors report any failure to the council and that if they do the council immediately convene the iraqis had failed the inspectors had reported and from the highest pulpit of the land president bush had summoned the council the diplomacy however was not yet over meeting with the british prime minister tony blair on friday president bush seemed to soften his position saying he would welcome another united nations resolution but he also maintained that it was not necessary and that he would only support another signal that we 're intent upon disarming saddam hussein in the end most diplomats expected that the united states would prevail and that even france would fall in line after all during the bitter debate about the international criminal court one european official noted the united states blinked more often but france blinked last this was not a time when any country wanted to end up on the wrong side of the united states the administration had shown a superpower can get its way by making clear that it is prepared to go it alone if the military operations succeed if mr hussein and his cronies were toppled quickly and without too many dead or even better if he went voluntarily into exile history demonstrates that all the bludgeoning and resentments would soon be forgotten and the world would celebrate a great common victory but what if the operation goes wrong that critics said was when all the resentments generated over months of strong arm tactics could backfire have we weakened the anti terrorism alliance said samuel r berger the national security adviser to president clinton in his second term and if we wind up disagreeing with france and germany can we manage that in a way that does not do long term damage we have n't made it easy for them taking a kind of contemptuous attitude rather than trying to speak to the issues that the europeans are raising some of which are quite fair but for an administration on a roll these were idle doubts we will of course win militarily if we have to mr bush said but we 'll also want to make sure we win the peace as well
