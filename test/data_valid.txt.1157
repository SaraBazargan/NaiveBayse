mother lolita a new play by guillermo reyes billed as an outrageous comedy by urban stages which is giving it its first production is actually an extended cartoon strip beyond the reach of parental guidance and while it is a remarkably efficient laugh machine mr reyes assumes that if all the characters are sufficiently corrupted in one way or another the playwright 's license is unlimited so outrage is not a response that would occur to anyone some people may think he needs that protection he extorts laughter from among many subjects murder embezzlement homosexuality motherhood extortion of migrants and evangelical religion to set up a comic revenge involving a wooden leg he resurrects the memory of an incestuous assault on a teenage girl and to expose the tricky hypocrisy of the politics of victimhood he concocts a funny riff on political imprisonment in augusto pinochet 's chile the country from which he migrated as a child in the 1970 's along with his mother yet mother lolita does get laughs right through some quite boisterous a tribute mr reyes has to share generously with the director and cast that urban stages has assembled for it the play is set in a latino neighborhood of los angeles after the last major earthquake there in the 1990 's and roman tatarowitz 's set a clever evocation of what is left standing has enough crevices holes and fissures to make a comic maze for t l reilly the director to send the actors bouncing tumbling and groping through in ways that enforce the impression of an inspired piece of animation no character here develops enough depth to excite any distracting empathy and the cast whizzes through the piece with such engaging energy that you do n't notice until it 's over that it has managed to cohere with no assistance from anything that could be called a plot the three who produce the greatest merriment are the women brigitte viellieu davis as lola the rent gouging manager of hollywood pit gardens is a delicious sexual predator who seems totally unaware that men are drawn to her precisely because they sense she might devour them or that there is anything wrong with robbing the poor rana kazkaz as a furtive street vendor of dubious neckties creates one of those harmless looking mutterers about whom dylan thomas used to say you can tell they 're mad by just looking at them mary bacon pulls off something of a coup with her ellie o'shaughnessy a pregnant evangelist whose vision is conquering the world through cable television to fill a sudden void ms bacon leaped into this role only a couple of days before previews started and she creates the one character who could leap right out of this play and amply occupy one of her own to see her is to laugh and to hear her is to roar so there is a lot of laughter in this 100 minute show but also a discomforting feeling that you may never know why you are laughing mother lolita is a long way from men on the verge of a his panic breakdown the laid back amusing and somewhat introspective one man play about eight latino gay men that first brought mr reyes to the notice of new york audiences several years ago and that even at this distance seems to speak to your memory from within yourself mother lolita by guillermo reyes directed by t l reilly set and lighting by roman tatarowitz costumes by markas henry sound by marc gwinn technical director dave hugo production stage manager ken hall stage manager matt murphy presented by urban stages playwrights preview productions frances hill artistic director mr reilly producing director sonia kozlova program director at the 30th street theater 259 west 30th street manhattan with matt skollar tristerio brigitte viellieu davis lola piter fattouche capo mary bacon sister ellie rana kazkaz santa carlos molina franco caesar samayoa xavier
