the lights were out at the jets complex monday night the first time this season there was no need for anyone to work late but that will not last long general manager terry bradway is scouting college players at the senior bowl in mobile ala and the coaching staff will meet next week to evaluate the roster then a few days after the super bowl the salary cap experts will gather to evaluate the team 's financial situation the jets who looked like frantic christmas eve shoppers scooping up defensive free agents last year will not be quite as busy although they are expected to have some wiggle room under the projected 74 million salary cap their top priorities will most likely be trying to retain the free agent guard randy thomas a pro bowl alternate and working on a long term deal for receiver laveranues coles a restricted free agent the offensive line struggled during the first half of the season after losing guard kerry jenkins to free agency and tackle ryan young to the expansion draft but the jets committed a lot of money to re signing center kevin mawae and left tackle jason fabini and may be reluctant to spend more on another lineman thomas may be attractive to bill parcells and the dallas cowboys too parcells who shares an agent with thomas drafted thomas and immediately made him a starter for the jets in 1999 thomas said he was excited by his first opportunity to test free agency although he added he wanted to stay with the jets randy 's going to have options bradway said hopefully it will be best for both situations for him to stay here but we 're going to make an offer to these people in the past we have and some guys have left and some guys have stayed but our goal is to try to keep this team together as much as possible coles who is chad pennington 's favorite receiver might have the most clear headed perspective on personnel turnover i 'd be excited about getting an opportunity to stay here but you do n't want to get your hopes up high he said we do n't know what coach has planned we 've seen a lot of good players come through here and go other places and this organization has proved they can win without them who is to say they ca n't win without me the most intriguing situations involve two aging veterans mo lewis and vinny testaverde both of whom could also be on parcells 's radar screen parcells has always preferred to bring in players he is familiar with wherever he goes coach herman edwards has done the same with the defensive players from tampa bay he brought in lewis who will require arthroscopic surgery on his hip during the off season had a subpar season recording 114 tackles and only a half sack the jets want to get younger and faster at linebacker and lewis could be a casualty particularly because the jets might focus on a linebacker with the 22nd pick in the draft the jets will keep sam cowart the jewel of last year 's shopping spree although they might try to renegotiate his contract under the six year deal cowart signed last spring he is due a bonus of 35 million by march 1 despite public proclamations from both sides that they expect testaverde to return as pennington 's backup next season michael azzarelli testaverde 's agent will check the landscape to see if there are any opportunities for testaverde to start azzarelli has already spoken informally with the jets who have indicated they will not stand in testaverde 's way and will release him june 1 if he has a chance to start elsewhere parcells who needs a veteran quarterback could figure prominently if the jets release testaverde he will still count 35 million on the 2003 salary cap if he stays with the jets his cap figure is 45 million testaverde will continue his workouts during the off season to be prepared for whatever happens it 's a function of figuring out who is where and what they need azzarelli said today it 's whether or not for example washington drafts rex grossman there 's a pretty good chance he wo n't come in and be the starter but they need someone for a year to be a starter and train somebody dallas is probably not out of the question bill will want to bring in a veteran vinny is the consummate soldier he 's going to say all the right things is vinny comfortable on the sidelines no that 's just not the case place kicker john hall is also a free agent jim steiner his agent approached the jets during the season to talk about a new contract but was told the team would probably not do anything until free agency opens march 4 hall was also brought to the jets by parcells hall who said he liked being a jet had six kicks blocked this season but he made 12 of his last 13 field goal attempts and 17 straight extra point attempts my guess is that as we approach march 1 we 'll have some conversations steiner said the ball is in their court
