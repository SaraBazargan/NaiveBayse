i have n't yet seen a burning man sticker on a cadillac but when i do it wo n't surprise me that is because burning man the annual weeklong festival of arts music and radical self expression in the nevada desert is rapidly seeping into mainstream american culture or is it the other way around like many other things countercultural and groovy burning man started in the bay area when larry harvey built and burned an effigy on a san francisco beach in 1986 publicized by word of mouth and on the web the event caught the imagination of the digerati and took on a life of its own sequels grew so big that mr harvey had to move the pyrotechnics to somewhere a bit less populated a desolate stretch of federally owned desert 100 miles north of reno this year 's event culminated on labor day about 28000 people participated in the ephemeral makeshift community black rock city that materializes for the annual torching of a huge wood and neon figure burn heads are loath to make the comparison but the festival which draws so many people from silicon valley that it could easily be called burn rate man has much in common with a grateful dead concert young and formerly young people camping out enjoying performance art and maybe various levels of undress and altered states of consciousness and raging against the machine ostensibly burning man is anti corporate anti consumerism anti establishment people cover over the ryder logos on their trucks and wear handmade outfits that reflect the inner them of the day hard currency will get you only coffee and ice at the festival you have to bring other supplies along with you or barter for them think survivor without the lush foliage burning man co opts people out of their rut and shows them a different way of living working playing and communicating said larry smith 32 the executive editor of yahoo internet life magazine who has made the pilgrimage six times i attended last year and for all my skepticism i have to say that i had a hilarious if slightly dehydrating time but what i found there was n't a digital age woodstock it was more fascinating the internet made flesh you 've got your communities of affinity viral marketing information pricing users provide the content approach branding and larry harvey is the very essence of today 's iconoclast savant ceo said brad wieners 32 editor of the book burning man hardwired 1997 all that 's missing is the ipo there are certainly enough dollars involved to go public depending on when you buy your ticket burning man can cost 95 to 250 multiply that by 28000 and well you do the math and how anti establishment can an event be when the managing editor of time magazine makes an appearance or when the green tortoise travel company advertises package trips to the wildest experience you 've ever had or when law firms send squads of employees in rented rv 's what 's next a let 's go black rock city travel guide aly eisenhardt 22 a junior at humboldt state university in california who had attended burning man twice before did n't go this year it 's gotten too commercial too big and too hypocritical ms eisenhardt said it 's outside the value system of what burning man was really about anything underground and successful eventually becomes commercial and overdone each generation has had its its own counterculture jamboree images of the beats haight ashbury monterey the dead nirvana mosh pits and techno raves come to mind before long the grownups come piling in and spoil the fun so too with the web some would say but not with burning man the dynamic is different most participants are not rebellious teenagers but people in their 20 's and 30 's with jobs and even companies of their own more than a few are stock option millionaires this generation may not openly condone selling out but it certainly does n't frown on capitalism and getting rich by past counterculture standards them equaled us from the very beginning mr wieners who has seen seven men burn said that while the festival has been legitimized by the establishment that does n't mean that it is being destroyed there are a lot of paradoxes he said the guy who 's the main instigator is making his living off burning man but has he sold out it 's not brought to you by budweiser it 's kept certain parameters this year some of the art had a much higher production value because artists are getting grants from burning man is this bad he added it 's discovering that play folly make believe the way you spent afternoons in the early grades is a valid thing for an adult to do it 's what a whole lot of companies strive for realizing that innovation comes from play they want to encourage it to a point perhaps but if play breeds innovation and innovation breeds productivity and productivity breeds sales one thing is clear bumper stickers ca n't be far behind preludes abby ellin is a manhattan writer her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third sunday of
