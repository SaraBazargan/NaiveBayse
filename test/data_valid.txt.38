pearl harbor ben affleck josh hartnett kate beckinsale alec baldwin jon voight cuba gooding jr ewen bremner william lee scott mako directed by michael bay pg 13 183 minutes at the film 's center is the spectacular day of infamy described by its architect admiral yamamoto mako as accomplishing little beyond awakening the sleeping american giant but it takes about an hour to set the table beginning in 1923 with two small tennessee farm boys who grow into the glowing fighter pilots rafe mr affleck winningly cocky and danny mr hartnett so dewily of the heartland he could have stepped from a corn husk on the distaff side a half dozen nurses are as much caricatures as their flyboy counterparts rafe 's nurse is the lovely cool evelyn ms beckinsale but their affair is interrupted when he volunteers to fly with the royal air force in the battle of britain much happens but at last we approach the point of the exercise dec 7 1941 by now rafe and danny are in love with evelyn children are playing ball under fleecy skies when the japanese planes their torpedos angled for release come whipping in low from the north for the next 40 minutes or so the american pacific fleet goes up in huge orange fireballs in one hackneyed touch it is left to the film 's stutterer mr bremner to alert the others or try to guess who battle into their planes and go aloft to knock down a flock of attackers in washington president roosevelt mr voight demands immediate retaliation ushering in a longish third section of movie col james doolittle mr baldwin a prolific spinner of bromides in a movie full of them leads a raid on tokyo with rafe and danny flying two of the bombers it 's risky but it 's bold an adviser says no argument there general much else occurs evelyn stays cool and lovely violence saving private ryan set the standard for combat gore this film shies away from that degree of close in dismemberment and disembowelment though there is a flash or two nevertheless larger more diffuse scenes generate a realistic sense of horror bodies go flying and the gravely wounded are everywhere if not examined at length sex rafe and evelyn make love pg 13 fadeaway style in a parachute shed profanity mild for which children under age 8 absolutely not with its simple characters and grade school rhetoric the film is n't beyond the older children in this group but they 'd never make it through the mushy stuff and the rest is much too violent ages 9 11 see above yes the movie chronicles a major moment in history albeit with factual modifications but it is quite a load for young children especially at this length the love story will bore them to tears and they are n't the only ones ages 12 and up like doolittle they should make it through the animal rob schneider colleen haskell john c mcginley guy torry edward asner directed by luke greenfield pg 13 83 minutes a hapless police clerk named marvin mr schneider flies off not one cliff but three in a single automobile accident normally that would spell finito but what 's left of him is dragged off by a mad professor and restored by using animal parts now in addition to being the sweet mannered butt of everyone 's abuse marvin is part dog and mountain lion he can also outrun a horse sniff out heroin at the airport and swim like a dolphin all of this dovetails with rianna ms haskell of survivor television show fame who runs an animal shelter and would make love to trees if she could rianna seems taken with marvin 's combination of simpering submissiveness and more assertive characteristics you are an animal she says after they have sex off screen marvin however noses for bones in trash barrels and retreats to the men 's room to trumpet like an elephant when creatures are mysteriously done away with the town organizes a beast witch hunt violence some threatening moves but this is clearly farce sex many references and implications particularly for a movie that will attract young children specific sex acts are referred to by name furthermore marvin has trouble controlling his urges around animals and makes a pass at a goat it 's all part of the gag of course but it is laid on heavily profanity a fair amount footnote marvin has a black friend mr torry who observes that white people routinely excuse black people for bad behavior which to him is a kind of reverse discrimination for which children under age 11 the sex will rule it out for many parents ages 11 and up should n't be a problem what 's the worst that could happen martin lawrence danny devito john leguizamo carmen ejogo glenne headly nora dunn directed by sam weisman pg 13 98 minutes when the media mogul max fairbanks mr devito catches the burglar kevin caffery mr lawrence rifling his beach mansion they start vying over a ring they consider lucky it gets involved but kevin 's girlfriend amber ms ejogo gave him the ring and max 's staff psychic ms headly tells him it will bring smooth sailing as arrogant as they come max is under investigation for owning too many television stations encountering financial speed bumps he is advised to file for bankruptcy which focuses attention on his mansion and its contents as well as expensive items in his boston town house all that loot lures kevin and his assistant berger mr leguizamo who burglarize both places little max does n't care about that or much else either having bribed all the senators and judges he needs he has few concerns about his ultimate welfare but he 'll fight for that ring which bears his company 's logo and remains lodged on his chubby finger despite kevin 's every effort to yank it off maybe these two should team up violence some jokey robbery rough and tumble with a few shots fired but no one gets hurt sex there is plenty of the pg 13 variety which means no action but a lot of references and situations kevin and amber are lovers max has a girl in every mansion unabashedly regards and discusses their anatomies concealed by bubble bath and the like and seems to expect sex from any woman he encounters profanity strong obscenities for which children under age 11 for many sex and profanity will earn a parental veto ages 11 and up mr lawrence is a draw in a tolerable comedy
