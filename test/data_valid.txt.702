even technology companies get good news sometimes eighteen months ago terayon communications systems a silicon valley maker of cable modems was a company with a hot but unproven technology a surging stock and a credibility problem short sellers who make money when stocks fall were furiously attacking the company claiming that terayon 's technology would never become part of the cable industry 's standard for modems last tuesday terayon finally proved the shorts wrong as cablelabs a nonprofit research center financed by the cable industry decided that the next generation of modems should include terayon 's technology the company 's shares jumped more than 50 percent that day on the news they closed friday at 701 up 68 percent for the week please excuse terayon 's shareholders though if their joy is muted despite last week 's gains terayon 's shares are more than 95 percent below the highs they set in the heady days of march 2000 in its haste last year to grow the company made the same mistakes of many a technology company adding too many product lines and building up inventory for sales that never came terayon 's nadir came on dec 18 when it told analysts that its fourth quarter sales would be less than half of what wall street expected its shares fell 61 percent that day but now unlike many fallen highfliers terayon is getting a second chance to prove that it is for real and this time it may succeed the cablelabs announcement prompted five of the wall street analysts who follow terayon to raise their ratings on the company deutsche banc alex brown lehman brothers w r hambrecht company and kaufman brothers raised their recommendations to buy from hold while ubs warburg raised its rating to strong buy from below average winning cablelabs approval is a major milestone for the company said clifton gray an analyst for kaufman brothers prior to the announcement i really had believed that a lot of the company 's future had depended on whether it could get included in the new standard for five years cablelabs has been creating a standard called docsis to ensure that all new cable modems which transfer data at high speeds over standard cable lines will work interchangeably the american cable industry created the laboratory which is based in louisville colo to ensure that different cable companies would not wind up with incompatible modems or server computers which connect cable systems to the internet the first two versions of docsis 10 and 11 did not include terayon 's technology which is called s cdma or synchronous code division multiple access as a result terayon was essentially locked out of the united states the world 's largest and most lucrative market for cable modems and servers the company was able to compete in the rest of the world in fact it picked up a 22 percent worldwide market share in the cable server business second only to cisco systems according to the dell'oro group a technology research firm but analysts worried that as the docsis standard spread worldwide terayon 's server sales would shrink but docsis 20 the new cablelabs standard does include s cdma terayon will not have a monopoly on s cdma because companies must agree to license technology for free to other modem suppliers if they want to be included in the standard still terayon has worked with s cdma since 1994 and that experience should help it to introduce its new modems and servers faster than its competitors analysts say cablelabs will not certify that any equipment meets the new standard until at least the second half of next year according to mike schwartz a cablelabs spokesman but terayon expects to begin selling servers that can easily be upgraded to docsis 20 sometime in the first quarter of next year said zaki rakib terayon 's chief executive docsis 20 modems should be adopted relatively quickly mr savageaux said while telecommunications companies are pulling back on capital spending as their profits plunge cable companies continue to report strong cash flow he said and consumer demand for high speed internet access remains strong the new standard also offers advantages over older modems although it does not increase download speeds docsis 20 allows consumers to upload data to the internet much faster than earlier standards that speed should enable cable companies to offer customers new applications like videoconferencing said mr schwartz the cablelabs spokesman for technical reasons having faster uploads also improves download times even for subscribers using older modems mr rakib said this decision is definitely going to have an impact on the top line mr rakib said having s cdma included in docsis provides terayon with a competitive advantage andrea green a lehman brothers analyst wrote in a research report we expect terayon to begin recording additional sales as a result of this in 2002 she wrote ms green said terayon 's sales could reach 370 million next year up from 270 million this year mr rakib said he expected the increased sales would stem terayon 's losses analysts predict the company will lose 149 a share this year or about 102 million next year the company is expected to lose 97 cents a share but that estimate was made before the cablelabs announcement and mr rakib predicts that terayon will be profitable by the second half of 2002 if he is correct terayon which will end this quarter with more than 300 million in cash is expected to be able to survive without new capital until it turns profitable the company also has 200 million in convertible bonds outstanding but those are not due until 2007 that 's obviously a lot of runway said tim savageaux analyst at w r hambrecht with cash not a problem terayon 's success or failure will have pretty much everything to do with how they execute here now investors have to hope the company does not squander its second chance
