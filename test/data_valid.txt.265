the question was asked of atlanta manager bobby cox shortly after the braves victory over the san francisco giants in game 2 of the national league division series on thursday with catcher javy lopez having homered in the first two games of the series was there any chance of lopez catching saturday when greg maddux would start for the braves no cox replied as he smiled cox was asked how difficult it was to remove lopez from the lineup it 's not a hard decision cox said it 's very simple real easy it is the unwritten rule of the braves when maddux starts anyone but lopez catches charlie o'brien eddie perez paul bako and now henry blanco have taken turns backing up lopez and serving as maddux 's personal catcher maddux is a cerebral pitcher with normally pinpoint control he relies on his rapport with his catcher and he obviously has a good one with blanco blanco will be in the lineup saturday for game 3 with the three of five game series tied at 1 1 he will play in a postseason game for the first time in his five year career lopez despite his production in the first two games was resigned to that fact i 'm accustomed to it by now he said today lopez caught maddux twice this season but that was after coming off the bench lopez has not been in the starting lineup with maddux pitching since sept 8 1998 according to the elias sports bureau maddux and lopez 's divergence had already begun by then in 1996 when maddux won his last cy young award he had a 344 earned run average in the 131 innings that lopez caught in the 114 innings that perez caught him maddux 's era was 189 at 36 maddux had another standout season this year finishing 16 6 with the second lowest era 262 in the national league he joined cy young as the two pitchers with 15 straight seasons of 15 or more victories a blister on his right index finger pushed maddux back from starting game 2 on thursday it also caused him to leave his final start of the regular season early and finish two thirds of an inning short of 200 innings pitched for the 15th straight season maddux 's dominance has included the giants he has gone 17 4 with a 229 era in his last 22 starts against san francisco but he has become a different pitcher in the postseason going 2 8 with a 316 era in his last 14 postseason starts dating from the 1997 national league championship series against the florida marlins lopez 's play was limited this season by more than maddux 's starts a right shoulder injury limited lopez who is in his 11th season with the braves to 109 games he batted a career low 233 and matched his career low for a full season with 11 home runs things change in the playoffs though lopez has three hits in eight at bats in the first two games with two home runs and three rbi he has 10 postseason home runs since 1995 and 27 rbi in 177 postseason at bats over 53 games in the regular season nothing comes out right lopez said during the postseason everything does i get good pitches to hit i 'm not sure why but i try to dominate in the postseason because i know if we lose we wo n't play tomorrow lopez will not say he feels hurt that he has no chance of staying in the lineup when maddux pitches and said the only difficulty was in coming off the bench and he is gracious toward blanco adding i count on my teammate henry blanco picking me up in past seasons when lopez 's average was near or above 300 and he was hitting 20 plus home runs the drop off in offense was more drastic that is especially true in the postseason when runs are at a premium cox argued today that blanco hit better than lopez during much of the season though blanco finished with a 204 average 6 home runs and 22 rbi in 81 games blanco also threw out 35 percent of the runners trying to steal even though maddux has traditionally been easy to run against lopez threw out a respectable 30 percent it 's not tough at all because i like blanco as a hitter too cox said javy has been hot but henry is the best defensive catcher too he helps maddux throw runners out people like to steal off him and henry can help stop that
