nasa is using inspectors who have no experience in aviation space or other technical fields and the kennedy space center does not even have a formal training program a member of the columbia accident investigation board said in a report of his own issued today that board member brig gen duane deal an air force safety expert also said that staffing levels and the extent of government inspection of contractor work were inadequate and that there were security problems at the factories that make the space shuttle 's booster rockets and external fuel tanks the full board 's report on the destruction of the columbia was issued on tuesday at a news conference here but general deal did not attend because he was in houston briefing astronauts and the families of the columbia crew members today he issued a 10 page supplement that he said had been written to augment that report not dissent from it the supplement is signed by general deal alone although in it he thanks four other members for their assistance in preparing it and laura j brown a spokeswoman for the board said others who served on the 13 member body would also be submitting supplements the full board 's report found that the immediate cause of the columbia accident was a chunk of insulating foam that fell from the shuttle 's external tank and hit a wing on liftoff foam is no longer the next accident waiting to happen general deal said in a telephone interview but if we even have a glimpse of the next one we have an obligation to bring it out the supplement suggests that the space agency has a number of unresolved hardware and personnel problems that are even larger than the board report described some of the problems cited by general deal were listed in the main report as observations apparently lacking the consensus needed to rise to the level of recommendations addressing them one of those singled out by general deal is what nasa has described as intermittent failure in a system that holds the shuttle down to the launching pad with cables and releases it when the engines start failure to release completely would be catastrophic he pointed out similarly the hardware that attaches the booster rockets to the external tank has been approved by technical analysis and not actual physical testing general deal said the board should have recommended that the parts be tested to assure that they are 40 percent stronger than the maximum forces they encounter among the other points raised by general deal was that the kennedy space center in florida added 35 new inspectors after a report by an independent assessment team in 2000 was critical of staffing levels there but most of the increase has eroded through retirements promotions departures and one death that assessment team he noted and the commission that reported on the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle challenger called for quality assurance procedures at the space center that would be independent of the shuttle program but management there took an opposite tack
