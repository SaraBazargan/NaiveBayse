a utilityman for the orioles melvin mora changes positions as often as he changes his children 's diapers being versatile is perhaps his biggest strength and it is a good thing he has been so adaptable playing baseball nowadays is the easiest part of his life back home in bel air md melvin and his wife gisel are busy rearing baby quintuplets and a 5 year old girl how do i handle it mora 30 said before a recent game i have a wonderful wife melvin and gisel married during the all star game break in 2000 and soon decided to have children gisel 27 who has a daughter tatiana from a previous marriage used fertility treatments and became pregnant she learned she was carrying quintuplets during spring training last year it was melvin 's only off day in spring training gisel said i started bleeding and i thought i had miscarried we went to the doctor 's office and they found five strong heartbeats i was so relieved but melvin he looked like he was about to pass out two and a half months before the babies were due while mora was with the orioles in anaheim calif gisel began experiencing hard contractions at 7 10 am on july 28 2001 a team of nearly 20 doctors and nurses at johns hopkins hospital started delivering and taking care of five babies two boys christian and matthew and three girls rebekah genesis and jada they were born when gisel was a little more than 26 weeks along in her pregnancy at that point said dr chris lehmann an attending physician in the neonatal intensive care unit at johns hopkins the odds of survival are pretty good but a premature birth does guarantee being susceptible to illness the quintuplets had immature lungs and needed a breathing machine their brain size was small and their immune systems weak the largest baby christian weighed about two and a half pounds the babies were so small mora said that he could slide the national league championship ring he earned with the 2000 mets size 11 up each baby 's arm to the shoulder nobody believed how small they were he said the babies require intensive medical care they recuperated at mount washington pediatric hospital in baltimore and they were not healthy enough to go home until october gisel still spends a few days a week transporting her babies to various doctors offices some of the children continue to use feeding tubes although gisel said they were improving daily none of them have had a perfect course lehmann said they were all very worrisome at some point the moras are very fortunate for the most part the moras have coped with the difficulties of caring for the quintuplets on their own gisel who grew up in coney island has family in new york melvin 's relatives live in his native venezuela the moras decided to maintain their year round residence in bel air to be close to their doctors at johns hopkins although aided by a nanny a few days a week gisel has handled the bulk of the parenting duties and she handles it seemingly with ease everything in the house is ultraorganized each child has color coordinated bottles and often all five babies are dressed in matching outfits the three girls sleep in two cribs in a room decorated with ballerinas each of the boys has his own crib in another room which has a baseball theme the children eat at the same time each day nap together and amazingly all pretty much sleep through the night at least once a night one of them wakes up at about 2 in the morning melvin said smiling gisel still somehow manages to drive tatiana to gymnastics class for the most part gisel tries to make sure melvincan concentrate on baseball he 's all business said orioles second baseman jerry hairston jr a close friend of mora 's to be able to focus the way he has is a credit to him it 's amazing they make it look so easy what most of the players did not see however were the numerous trips mora made to the hospital to visit his babies i saw mr mora quite a bit lehmann said i 'm a father of a premature infant myself so i know that must have been a lot of stress on him still mora has been one of the more productive players in the orioles lineup usually baltimore 's leadoff hitter he was batting 246 with 11 stolen bases a team high 349 on base percentage and 28 walks going into this weekend last monday against the san diego padres he had a career high five runs batted in including a two run home run in the bottom of the eighth that gave the orioles an 8 6 victory so far this season he has played second base shortstop center field and left field in the past he has also played third and right field last season he had a 250 batting average and a 362 on base percentage comparable numbers from his prequints stage to tell you the truth it never concerned me how it was going to affect melvin on the field orioles manager mike hargrove said i believe god does n't give you more than you can handle and melvin seems like a very stable person there were a lot of problems with those babies last year like a crisis a week and i heard about some of them but not from him a popular myth in baseball is that every player is a multimillionaire playing in his fourth major league season mora is making about 350000 more than the average joe but just a little more than the league minimum he also supports his mother a sister and a couple of brothers in venezuela one of his brothers jose was murdered by a hit man in april in venezuela mora who also played a partial season of winter ball to earn extra money is now helping with tuition for jose 's three children the mora babies go through plenty of formula and roughly 35 diapers a day when we buy groceries people ask us 'who are you giving food to mora said they think it 's like a donation or something gisel said she might have to cut back the nanny 's hours to keep the family 's household expenses in check the orioles have pitched in to help the wives threw a couple of baby showers for gisel among the gifts were payments for housekeepers every time he gets a hit said hargrove 's wife sharon i say 'go melvin feed those babies it is difficult for mora to be on the road it 's really hard for him gisel said there are many times i wish he did n't have to travel and to top it off the babies are doing so many cute things now when he comes home it 's like he 's lost sometimes the kids cried when he held them the babies have made it to camden yards only a couple of times because such an excursion is a logistical feat on their first trip about two weeks into the season mora wheeled them into the locker room in a custom made five baby stroller melvin was just beaming said stacey johnson the wife of orioles pitcher jason johnson he was so excited to bring his kids to the ballpark that he did n't even change out of his uniform for mora not changing was a welcome change backtalk amy rosewater is a freelance writer in baltimore
