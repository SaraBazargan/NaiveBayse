critics who judged ronald reagan a regrettably ordinary man disengaged even when he was n't on stage as president of the united states may be surprised to discover that he was dedicatedly dashing off thousands of letters to a wide assortment of pen pals political allies and even a few global enemies a sampling from decades of letters has just been published revealing a hunger for contact with all manner of people his hand jotted observations on practically everything in life from the simple joy in a starry night to executive imaginings of a star wars missile defense hardly present a threat to marcus aurelius 's meditations for introspective angst and wisdom in a leader but they do reflect an egalitarian curiosity affability and humility before fellow humans his letters confirm not greatness so much as exultation in ordinary life the middling actor turned president wrote as plainly to leonid brezhnev is n't it possible that some of those obstacles are born of government aims and goals which have little to do with the real needs and wants of our people as he did to his old hollywood barber upon the death of his wife i want you to know how deeply sorry we are he took amusing pains to thank richard nixon for his 11 page single spaced memo of advice i ca n't thank you enough more believable was his thanks to dwight eisenhower for early career advice on how to campaign for california governor my tv appearances profited by a reduction in verbiage before his mind sadly faded in retirement mr reagan 's letters remained free of statesman 's bloviation i think the soviets are really working to become as free as we are wrote the last cold war president in 1992 as communism crumbled
