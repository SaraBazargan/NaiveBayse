as a left wing with the rangers three decades ago glen sather is mostly remembered as what is known now as a role player occasionally in an unusual role such as the time emile francis the rangers coach tapped him on the shoulder after center jean ratelle had lost the edge on his skates sather hopped over the boards onto the ice no no francis said go in and sharpen ratelle 's skates or when the rangers installed a new safe in the dressing room to hold the players valuables only the trainer knew the combination lock but there was sather stretched out on the floor listening to the clicks inside the safe as he turned the lock this way and that way slats opened that safe francis has often said right then i knew he would be a general manager some day now at 56 glen sather has a bigger role find the combination of players and coaches that will open the rangers safe with a seven year contract for at least 20 million as president and general manager he has been entrusted with sharpening the franchise that for three seasons was not good enough to be among the 16 teams in the stanley cup playoffs say this for dave checketts the garden impresario he got the best man out there with the best resume in his two decades as the edmonton oilers boss sather put together five stanley cup teams from 1984 to 1990 including the first four as their coach as well as general manager he is already in the hockey hall of fame but it 's not fair to expect him to be that successful with the rangers at least not right away it was different then he said of assembling the nucleus of that oiler team we had gretzky and he was 18 those oilers had more than wayne gretzky they had mark messier grant fuhr jari kurri glenn anderson paul coffey kevin lowe esa tikkanen even after sather traded gretzky to los angeles because the oilers could no longer afford the salary that the great one deserved the oilers won that fifth cup in 1990 with messier as the man sather later traded messier to the rangers who after a 54 year drought finally won the cup in 1994 with messier as the man to sooth the rangers fans over messier 's ugly departure checketts and sather are expected to bring back messier from vancouver if he becomes a free agent july 1 not that messier at 39 would suddenly lift the rangers to the stanley cup level but his locker room dignity would demand what was missing in a 612 million payroll accountability from the other players although the rangers true tradition is having won only one stanley cup in the last 60 years checketts a basketball guy who did n't arrive here until a decade ago prefers to relate to the celebration of having finally won that cup in 1994 i wanted somebody who played here who understood being here checketts said of sather that was part of our problem that 's why i sent stephane quintal home when he said he did n't want to be here not enough respect to be a ranger sather understands that respect in his transient career with six national hockey league teams those ranger teams he was on with rod gilbert vic hadfield brad park ed giacomin and ratelle were always in the playoffs in 1972 they went to the cup finals losing to bobby orr 's bruins but we do n't want to win the cup in a flash checketts said we want to build a dynasty that 's presumptuous but in hockey as in baseball dynasties are possible because there is no salary cap but the rangers now are a disaster not a dynasty a disaster that sather surely will rebuild into at least a playoff team next season his first move will be to hire a coach possibly the current oiler coach kevin lowe or craig mactavish an oiler assistant both were on the rangers cup team in 1994 for now sather 's job is not to win the cup so much as to lift the rangers toward the level of the devils now 1 1 in the stanley cup finals after last night 's 2 1 loss to the dallas stars in the absence of lord stanley 's chalice at yesterday 's news conference in the madison square garden rotunda checketts welcomed sather to the big apple with a silver apple from tiffany 's where checketts joked sather 's wife ann would now be shopping you do n't know me very well yet sather said with a smile ann wo n't be in tiffany 's ann sather smiled too maybe because when she was asked later if she would be going to tiffany 's now she said i 've been there
