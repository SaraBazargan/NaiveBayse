for some planning for last weekend 's blizzard meant stocking up at a supermarket or a hardware store but for those keeping roads and rails in the state clear preparations were more complex the connecticut department of transportation which is responsible for 5800 miles of roads began the friday before the storm when all of its 632 plows were outfitted and loaded with sand standard procedure before a weekend or holiday the first of those was deployed about 6 30 pm sunday in fairfield county it took a long time to progress northward said thomas e daly a storm monitor for the dot referring to the snow so in other areas we activated trucks a bit later in the neighborhood of 3 to 4 am once more than 25 percent of the plows were operating a command center was opened at the department 's headquarters in wethersfield where monitors like mr daley kept track of weather and road conditions and opened communications with district headquarters in rocky hill norwich new haven and thomaston the department of transportation has 250 private contractors to help plow if a storm is bad starting at about 5 am monday the department put all 250 into action the strong winds and the rate of snowfall made this storm especially difficult said mr daly who added that in some areas the snow fell at over three inches per hour even on tuesday all the state plows were running mostly clearing shoulders and exit ramps with the drivers working on 17 hour shifts metro north railroad began preparing on sunday afternoon by bringing almost every available car into its yard at grand central terminal according to daniel m brucker a metro north spokesman the bridgeport yard where cars are usually stored was nearly emptied it 's no different than wanting to keep your car in the garage when a snowstorm is coming to keep it warm to keep in dry to keep it ready to roll he said mr brucker said the storm was troublesome because it began when the railroad was not operating during the overnight hours from sunday into monday workers de iced and lubricated the more than 100 switches on the system 's more than 400 miles of track and controllers at grand central continuously worked the switches to keep them fluid the railroad also ran trains on the new haven line to clear snow from the overhead wires and the pantographs and a train with a plow on it called a pilot train to clear the tracks it 's a 2000 horsepower locomotive and we literally blasted them just up and down our tracks mr brucker said throughout the early part of the week metro north was also using crews with shovels and highly pressurized air hoses as well as a jet engine placed atop a rail car to clear tracks on monday the railroad went from a holiday schedule in the morning to just running diesel trains which are normally only used on the hudson and harlem lines once every two hours beginning at about 4 pm it slowly expanded its schedule on tuesday when it ran a sunday schedule mr brucker said the schedule was cut back because snow damages the engines of electric cars and the shoes that make contact with the third rail still he said about 65 cars were damaged by snow about 11 percent of the fleet he said the blizzard of 1996 put almost all of the railroad 's cars out of service for months our objective was to put out as few pieces of equipment as possible he said referring to the schedule on monday and tuesday this was one of those rare times when people were inconvenienced but the equipment was cared for
