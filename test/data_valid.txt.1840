the hubble space telescope an astonishingly productive but aging space based observatory is facing challenges that will determine how long it can keep performing first rate science in our view the life of the telescope should be extended until a more advanced replacement now in the planning stages is placed in orbit after some early technical modifications to repair flaws in its primary mirror hubble has been a resounding success floating well above the distorting effects of the atmosphere the observatory has been able to detect extremely faint objects that can not be found by earthbound telescopes hubble has provided the clearest and deepest views of the distant universe calibrated the age and expansion rate of the universe and detected supermassive black holes that seem to lie at the core of most galaxies among myriad other achievements the hubble telescope is supposed to be serviced by a shuttle mission in the next year or two then brought down from orbit in a controlled descent in 2010 the funds saved by phasing it out will be pumped into a follow on instrument the james webb space telescope scheduled to be launched in 2011 that telescope will be placed in an extremely high orbit and will be designed to operate at infrared wavelengths which are crucial to observing very early cosmic history and the formation of stars and planets hubble mostly detects visible light unfortunately the loss of the shuttle columbia has cast doubt on whether the next scheduled servicing mission to hubble can proceed without undue risk to the astronauts meanwhile nasa is assessing whether an additional servicing mission should be mounted later in the decade to keep the telescope operating past 2010 the problem as always is money congress has ordered that whatever is done with hubble can not siphon money away from the james webb space telescope that is a reasonable stance but the webb telescope may well fall behind schedule and could even suffer a disabling failure far beyond the reach of astronauts to repair thus it would make sense to keep hubble going at least until the webb telescope is successfully in orbit if money needs to be diverted from somewhere we suggest that it be taken from the partly completed space station circling aimlessly overhead no experiments planned for the space station come remotely close in importance to hubble 's potential for discoveries curtailing the hubble telescope before a successor has been launched seems foolish
