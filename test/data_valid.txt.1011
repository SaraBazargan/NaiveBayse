just outside the white walled military compound that american marines seized here 20 days ago engineers have fashioned a prison camp out of the desert sand surrounded by 10 foot berms are three long exposed holding pens ringed by coils of concertina wire and visible only from a looming guard tower they are designed to hold 20 to 30 prisoners and to expand quickly should the need arise until today the marines desert compound had only one inmate john walker lindh the american who joined the taliban 's ranks as an islamic warrior and who had been held in isolation inside a shipping container at this base in the kandahar region mr walker who uses his mother 's name was transferred today to the aircraft carrier peleliu in the arabian sea pentagon officials said the bush administration has not decided whether to treat him as a military prisoner of war or to bring charges of treason or terrorism but in the meantime the collapse of the taliban and the capture of al qaeda fighters and the growing prospects of an intelligence bonanza from interrogations of them has prompted an abrupt reversal of american policy that is evident in the prison camp that has emerged from the desert here just two weeks ago secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld dismissed the idea of detaining large numbers of taliban or al qaeda prisoners beyond top leaders like mullah muhammad omar and osama bin laden but this week he announced that american forces in afghanistan would very likely take a sizable number of prisoners into custody they are to be imprisoned at bases here in afghanistan like the marine encampment or the airport at kandahar which the marines have now taken over or aboard navy ships in the arabian sea gen tommy r franks the commander of american forces in the region said today he said that about 50 al qaeda prisoners had been taken in the intense fighting around tora bora today but are still in the hands of opposition commanders in the area united states commandos and intelligence operatives are supporting afghan fighters in that battle but in the kandahar area there have been no reports of major firefights or the seizure of any prisoners in recent days opposition forces have captured only two or three taliban leaders including its army chief of staff several of mr bin laden 's lieutenants have been killed but so far none have been taken prisoner other enemy fighters are hospitalized many prisoners could ultimately be tried by the fledgling government that takes control in kabul on dec 22 foreign fighters especially those belonging to al qaeda 's ranks could be extradited to their countries of origin if those nations assured the united states that they would face stiff punishment although human rights groups have warned that they should not be sent to countries that might abuse them the pentagon 's general counsel william j haynes ii has been working with justice department officials to establish legal guidelines on how american forces and authorities will deal with these various groups of battlefield captives it is increasingly clear that american forces here will use considerable discretion to capture higher ranking taliban and al qaeda fighters and prosecute them perhaps before the military tribunals that president bush has authorized mr rumsfeld said that american special forces troops and intelligence officers had already begun questioning prisoners in the custody of anti taliban forces he suggested the interrogations were revealing new details about how mr bin laden 's al qaeda network operated inside afghanistan there are interrogations taking place there 's documentation being found and discovered and analyzed and translated so that each day we learn more and know more as more address books are found and phone books are found and computer hard drives are found he said as people have left areas clearly our knowledge base is going up the actual number of prisoners now held by anti taliban forces remains something of a mystery the international committee for the red cross says it has visited about 700 prisoners at 15 various sites but concedes that this number is a fraction of the real total the number of prisoners is impossible to estimate said michael kleiner a spokesman for the committee 's office in kabul without a government in place it is impossible to know where people are being detained an additional concern within the pentagon is that taliban or al qaeda troops will be able to buy their way to freedom before american officials are able to interrogate them one senior military official said today that he had received reports that as many as 300 captured qaeda troops may have escaped detention in the tora bora region by bribing their guards the marines base here known as camp rhino is an ideal place because of its remote location and unlimited space for new holding pens it is a mission however that several officers here said they did not particularly relish in part because of the drain on the marines sparse logistics but a senior military official said today that the pentagon was considering sending light army forces possibly from the 101st airborne division to provide security at camp rhino if it is still needed several weeks from now although pentagon officials have stopped short of considering mr walker or other possible captives prisoners of war preferring for legal reasons to call them detainees a marine spokesman here capt stewart t upton said that mr walker was being afforded all the protections given to prisoners under the geneva conventions mr walker was held in a freight container receiving water and portions of the same military rations that troops here eat he has undergone medical treatment for wounds received in the prison uprising in mazar i sharif that led to his capture his condition is said to be improving
