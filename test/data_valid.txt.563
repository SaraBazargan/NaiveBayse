in a playoff series marked by displays of brute power the seattle mariners won today because of the efforts of a soft tossing 38 year old with a slight build who tips his cap to the umpire as he walks off the mound jamie moyer a left hander as effective as he is wholesome held down the cleveland indians might and led the mariners to a 5 1 victory in game 2 of their three of five game american league division series the series tied at 1 1 resumes saturday at jacobs field in cleveland the first game their pitcher dominated mariners manager lou piniella said today our starting pitcher and bullpen dominated in a different way the mariners who were helpless against the hard throwing right hander bartolo colon in game 1 greeted chuck finley with a pair of two run homers in the first inning today that was more than enough support for moyer and three relievers who secured a pivotal victory the mariners who matched a major league record with 116 regular season victories needed to leave safeco field with another it was n't an elimination game but it was a must win said jeff nelson who relieved moyer in the seventh inning you do n't want to go to cleveland down 0 2 and expect to try to take both games even though we had the best road record in baseball you do n't want to go there down 0 2 we needed this win today to even the series and have the momentum shift to us no pitcher in baseball is quite like moyer who works everything off his changeup and who spots his fastball with precision it can be an unconvincing combination one of the six teams that gave up on moyer suggested he retire and become a coach but after the mariners stole moyer from the boston red sox in 1996 trading the reserve outfielder darren bragg for him piniella found him to be everything he was looking for nothing grates on piniella as much as a pitcher who does not throw strikes moyer is fearless you have to have such great feel and such incredible confidence to throw those pitches said bryan price the mariners pitching coach you see greg maddux do it you just do n't see a lot of pitchers that can take that backdoor changeup and throw it with really good control usually the cardinal rule is lefties do n't throw lefties a changeup he 's broken that rule moyer 20 6 this season throws so softly that mark mcgwire once told him he should take batting practice with nerf balls to prepare for him but because of the way he sets up hitters moyer can sneak his fastball past even the most dangerous ones with two out and two on in the fourth inning moyer faced jim thome who hit 49 homers this season thome joked on wednesday that moyer 's changeup made his fastball seem 100 miles an hour faster and it seemed so today moyer fell behind 1 0 but brought the count even when thome swung at an inside fastball that registered 85 mph moyer threw the same pitch for strike three that 's all i have to offer said moyer who allowed one run on five hits and a walk i ca n't reach back and throw 95 i have to use the abilities that i have and try to find ways to get people out there might be different ways than the average person or the normal major league pitcher but i 'm pretty comfortable with what i have the victory was the first in the postseason for moyer who left a 1997 start with a strained elbow and missed last year 's playoffs with a broken kneecap finley meanwhile had not pitched in the postseason since he made three relief appearances for the angels in 1986 along the way he compiled a 19 8 career record against the mariners but finley walked the leadoff hitter ichiro suzuki who almost never walks he then faced mike cameron whose only hit in 17 career at bats against finley had been a bunt single cameron fell behind 0 2 setting himself up for finley 's splitter with suzuki on first as a threat to steal finley offered a fastball high and down the middle and cameron crushed it into the seats in left the mariners led 2 0 before making their first out and they doubled their lead two batters later when edgar martinez homered to center finley said he was not thinking about suzuki when he threw the fastball to cameron but cameron was doubtful i know in the back of his mind he did n't want ichiro in scoring position he said i just had a hunch he was going to throw a fastball and i wanted to be ready for it the mariners all seemed ready for finley 's fastball which came in at 89 to 92 mph colon had thrown closer to 100 mph finley said he was trying to throw more fastballs early to establish that pitch by the time he had his splitter and slider working it was too late i was looking forward to this for a long time finley said i tried to tell myself to relax and enjoy it and i did enjoy it but i did n't relax as much in the first inning as i thought i should have calm confident and courteous finley 's opponent evened the series inside pitch mariners shortstop carlos guillen took batting practice thursday for the first time since sept 28 when doctors diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis
