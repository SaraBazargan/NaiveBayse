q i live in a co op building whose owner occupancy ratio is very low about 30 percent this creates a series of problems as the aging long time residents in rent regulated apartments are being replaced by younger often careless tenants could the co op board establish a rule requiring a move in deposit to be paid in cash to the superintendent the board president claims that only the individual owners of the apartments would have a right to do so not the co op silvia colazingari hartley manhattan a aaron shmulewitz a manhattan co op lawyer said that most co op bylaws and proprietary leases grant to the co op the authority to collect move in and move out deposits in fact requiring move damage deposits has become the norm in most cooperatives mr shmulewitz said explaining that the deposits are intended to ensure that co ops are reimbursed for damage to lobbies staircases corridors elevators and other common areas during a move he said however that since the co op does not have a legal relationship with the subtenants of other shareholders or with tenants of the sponsor the co op only has the power to require the owner of the apartment to pay the fee generally speaking mr shmulewitz said the lease between the subtenant and the owner of a rented apartment would govern whether the owner had the right to pass the fee along to the subtenant in most cases he said passing along such fees would not be permitted for rent regulated tenants mr shmulewitz added that he would not recommend that such deposits be paid in cash to the building 's superintendent most cooperatives require a certified check payable to the co op or its managing agent with the funds being refunded if the move does not cause any damage he said selling the right to buy a condo q i am a rent stabilized tenant whose building is being converted into a condominium i am not buying but i would like to sell my right to buy to someone else can i do that also if i sell my right to buy the apartment do i maintain my regulated status j robinson manhattan a arthur i weinstein a manhattan lawyer who is vice president of the council of new york cooperatives and condominiums said that most condominium conversion plans address the issue of whether an existing tenant 's purchase agreement is assignable to a third party and most conversion plans say the purchase agreement is not assignable unless the sponsor consents to the assignment mr weinstein said mr weinstein pointed out however that it is often in the sponsor 's interest to consent to an assignment by a regulated tenant that is because a sponsor would typically prefer to sell such an apartment than have a relatively low rent tenant remain in the unit and while it may be possible for the letter writer to sell the right to buy the apartment and remain a rent stabilized tenant of the new owner it is unlikely that a third party would be willing to purchase the right to buy the apartment under those circumstances most people would not be willing to buy the right to buy an apartment from a rent stabilized tenant who retained the right to stay there forever mr weinstein said he said it might be possible however for the letter writer to work out an arrangement in which the new owner allows the letter writer to remain in the apartment for a specific period of time after the sale
