gillette the world 's leading maker of razors plans to pit the strength of its consumers loyalty against the potency of the country 's economic downturn the company unveiled a new line of blades and razors yesterday called mach3 turbo to go on sale in april for about 9 for a razor and two blades a 17 percent premium over the current mach3 the world 's best selling and most expensive mass market razor in recent years consumer products companies have tried to increase their profits by developing new more expensive versions of everything from toothpaste to batteries that strategy is likely to be tested in a recession when consumers may be tempted to give up a 9 razor and turn to a 1 version but gillette officials argue that few companies have more loyal devotees gillette seems to have cultivated a set of consumers who are willing to pay ever more for the promise of a shave that will give them just one fewer nick just one less burn although gillette has struggled in recent years with batteries deodorant and even its cheap disposable razors it has always scored successes with its premium razors even as the company has continued to raise the price of mach3 over the last year sales grew 23 percent in north america wall street analysts were skeptical in april when gillette began selling its venus razor for women worried that it would not sell in a slowing economy but the venus has captured 11 percent of the total shaving market making it the no 2 razor behind mach3 which has 24 percent of the blade market now fewer are ready to doubt the strategy on the face of it introducing a step up in this type of economy would raise questions said jim gingrich an analyst with sanford bernstein but it seems to me at least in the examples we have gillette has had a lot of success independent of the economic environment gillette introduced the sensor a mach3 predecessor that drove huge growth for the company in 1990 the cusp of the last downturn in part the company may benefit from the theory of small luxuries while consumers may put off the purchase of diamond bracelets and high definition televisions they might replace them with indulgences like top of the line cosmetics or sleek razors history has shown there is a portion of the market that is anxious for our next innovation said peter k hoffman president of gillette 's grooming division on the face of it the introduction of turbo seems to contradict the priorities laid out by james m kilts who was appointed gillette 's chief executive in january in june mr kilts criticized his predecessors for introducing new products before they had recouped the investment of previous innovations he also said the company had ignored entry level disposable razors like gillette good news allowing rivals to steal market share but gillette officials said the development costs of turbo were not material and just a fraction of the 700 million gillette spent to develop mach3 while mach3 introduced in 1998 was an entirely new design turbo is more of an evolution still gillette says its new blade cuts hair straighter and closer without pulling or irritating skin as much before the introduction of mach3 in 1998 gillette invested in an expansion of its sensor excel capacity only to see sales of that razor eroded by the new product and the investment wasted this time gillette officials said if they had not decided to introduce turbo they would have had to expand production capacity of their mach3 blades but turbo will allow them to convert many current users to an even more profitable razor for a cost not much higher than expanding its mach3 production some analysts say turbo will be something of a test for mr kilts and gillette mr kilts has made reviving the personal care business a priority and gillette officials have tied the release of turbo to a new line of deodorants shaving creams and after shaves gillette like procter gamble has found a way to make a success of revolutionary design advances but the most successful consumer products companies like colgate palmolive have found more profit in incremental advances gillette has been very good at the 'new to the world innovation mr gingrich said but they are not as good with the 'new and improved version
