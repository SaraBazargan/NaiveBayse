aside from feeling downhearted staffers at galluccio family wineries were baffled by a recent tepid review of the estate 's new bordeaux style blend on march 16 discussing a 2000 red blend called cru george allaire i said among other things that the wine lacked definition and was on the dull side anita l legault who handles marketing at galluccio whose bottles also continue to carry the winery 's former name gristina phoned to say that this description did not correspond with others experience of the wine on monday i opened a second bottle she was absolutely right the bottles were worlds apart the wine a 26 melding of cabernet sauvignon merlot and cabernet franc is very attractive its cabernet sauvignon effect cassis beets a little tobacco a sprinkle of herbs came through vividly the wine is juicy vibrant and pleasing and i was sorry when the bottle was finished this was not i think a case of the critic getting it wrong though that can happen there was no evident flaw in the first bottle usually the most obvious problem is a defective cork which creates a musty aroma and degrades the flavor the seemingly irremediable problem of contaminated corks is driving the wine industry into using synthetic ones and screw caps something else something biological or chemical and seemingly indefinable was subtly invasively present in the galluccio red people who know a wine inside out sense when a bottle goes even a little awry those who do n't know it may think reasonably that they have bought a loser distinguishing between a faulty wine and a sound one that you may dislike is not always easy especially for novices the encyclopedicoxford companion to wine oxford university press 1999 second edition addresses a related issue that bedevils even the most careful collectors bottle variation one of the more tantalizing aspects of wine appreciation the book says it is only to be expected with a product as sensitive to storage conditions as wine that bottles of the same wine will differ perhaps because one has been exposed to higher temperatures or greater humidity there can easily be a perceptible difference in quality and character between bottles from the very same case if a bottle ordered in a restaurant seems defective immediately ask the waiter or sommelier to taste it even if you are unsure if you bought it recently from a merchant return it the next day if possible reputable wine sellers are usually reasonable about extending credits howard g goldberg
