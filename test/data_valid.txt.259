they are reputed to be the kings of adversity the team that grows incredibly strong and resilient when its roster and room for error are chopped short whether overcoming the loss of its star center making a huge halftime deficit disappear or ignoring a pronounced height disadvantage to block a jump shot the knicks seem to morph into basketball 's version of the little engine that could whenever necessary at madison square garden on monday the knicks will again try to snuff out long odds in game 4 of their eastern conference championship series with the indiana pacers with the availability of the hobbled big men patrick ewing and marcus camby already in question the knicks received more disheartening news today when a magnetic resonance imaging test revealed that latrell sprewell had an incomplete fracture of the fifth metatarsal in his left foot near the little toe it will be decided just before the 5 30 pm tip off whether sprewell who did not practice today will be able to play the availability of ewing who missed game 3 after spraining a tendon in his right foot on thursday and camby who sprained the medial capsule in his right knee on saturday will also be game time decisions coach jeff van gundy his team down two games to one is preparing as if all three players will miss the game i 'm not expecting any one of them to play he said after being forced to take the floor so his depleted team could simulate a five on five set at practice i 'm watching those guys and they have legitimate injuries i want them to play if they can be effective if they ca n't be effective then they 're going to have to sit there sprewell who recorded 32 points and 8 rebounds to lead the knicks to a 98 95 victory in game 3 on saturday said he injured himself while diving for a loose ball late in the fourth quarter he acknowledged that he could hardly walk today but disputed van gundy 's prognosis and said he planned to play at the time it did n't feel like much sprewell said of his injury really it did n't feel like much after the game either but this morning it was pretty swollen and pretty stiff it 's pretty sore i really ca n't walk on it good but i think i 'll be able to play i 'm planning on playing regardless ewing who is suffering from acute peroneal tendinitis said on saturday that he would definitely play in either game 4 or game 5 but he was unable to practice today before game 3 he slid into his warm ups got his ankles taped and attempted to jog onto the floor but his test run was cut short by the intense pain he will go through the same steps monday and hope for a different result camby who injured his knee while driving to the basket early in the second quarter did not attempt to run or jump today either but he said that if he were a betting man he would bet on himself to play monday he added that he would force himself to play if both sprewell and ewing were unavailable i just need to be ready to run on it camby said if i can run on it and push off then i 'm going to play camby who missed 19 games this season because of assorted right knee injuries complained before game 3 that his subpar play throughout the playoffs was because of his banged up body but he said there would be no such excuse if he plays i 'm not going to go out there and lay an egg camby said i think i can be somewhat effective i 'm going to get something accomplished if i 'm able to go so it just remains to be seen i feel confident i 've been playing with a banged up knee all season long and nothing i think is going to set me back from a confidence standpoint while the knicks have thrived in the face of injury the past two postseasons winning four of five games against indiana without ewing it seems virtually impossible for them to beat the pacers with sprewell ewing and camby on the sidelines they proved on saturday that they could overcome the losses of ewing and camby who played only five minutes before being injured but eliminating sprewell from the mix may be too much that would leave the knicks with just two legitimate scorers in allan houston and larry johnson and johnson is much less than 100 percent halfway through today 's practice van gundy pulled him out because of tightness in his back both he and johnson assured that he would play monday though van gundy said he was considering three starting lineups if ewing sprewell and camby do n't play he could start kurt thomas at power forward and move johnson to small forward start chris childs at shooting guard and move houston to small forward or start the little used john wallace at small forward as he did in game 3 chris dudley will start if ewing is absent whatever the case van gundy shared a bit of what will certainly become his pregame motivational speech with reporters we just got to find a way to get even tomorrow he said it does n't matter how it happens or who plays the nine that are left got to be ready to play you can make all the excuses for yourself and for your team and they do absolutely no good in the end no one cares instead of making excuses for why they ca n't give them reasons why they can and i think we have more than enough reasons why we can and that 's what we 've got to focus in on history is one reason the others are not so clear
