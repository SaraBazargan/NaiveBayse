serving as head of the nation 's largest school system is an education in itself of all the lessons i have learned in the last three years the most important is this attendance matters and for schools to achieve better attendance parents will have to become more involved i have learned other lessons of course contrary to popular belief the school bureaucracy can be extremely responsive even nimble this year for example i announced an initiative to improve new york 's math scores i met with the district math coordinators monthly discussed strategies with each superintendent and made improving math instruction the topic of the annual superintendents retreat as a result math scores improved by 36 percent overall the largest increase since the current testing program began the system also proved its worth in an emergency on sept 11 teachers principals and other school personnel acted quickly and heroically in many cases to ensure that all students were safe another lesson is the importance of technology beyond the classroom the system 's web site for example features information and analysis about everything from student performance to teacher certification while a computer is a valuable teaching aid a good teacher beats a good computer every time with determination teacher quality can be improved it is not enough for the school system to provide professional development we need to hire talent studies show that the students of certified teachers perform significantly better on standardized tests than the students of uncertified teachers yet three years ago only 40 percent of our new teachers were certified and few routinely got professional development today 100 percent of our hires will be certified in addition every new teacher receives a mentor but none of these lessons mean anything if parents are not sufficiently involved much has to be asked of schools but much must also be asked of parents politicians hesitate to raise the specter of absentee parents for fear of being accused of using the parents as scapegoats but homes that value learning will also nurture children who are avid students similarly schools in which parents are more involved tend to have students who perform better on tests at the same time i firmly believe that demographics is not destiny while studies may show that 75 percent of the average student 's performance is correlated with his or her parents socioeconomic status there are many children who routinely beat the odds the solution is to make the schools more conducive to parent involvement even while encouraging parents to be more involved in their children 's education there are many strategies to encourage parents the system 's grow reports provide individual test analyses to parents and guide them to helpful web sites our parent hotline gives parents another way to get involved the auto dialer has enabled us to increase attendance both in the summer program and during the year with on average 13000 more children in attendance this year participation in parent teacher conferences improved dramatically when we instituted a policy whereby only parents who attended could receive their children 's report cards yet 30 percent of our students still do not attend school regularly they are absent a month a year i believe this phenomenon exists all across the country but proving it is impossible as even the new federal leave no child behind act which relies heavily on data does not require uniform reporting of attendance it is no surprise that good attendance is highly correlated with superior student performance when parents ensure that their children attend every day schools are much more effective as it turns out this lesson comes from woody allen eighty percent of success is showing up harold o levy completed his tenure as chancellor of the new york city schools last week
