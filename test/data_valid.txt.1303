an earnest solo that could have turned embarrassingly overwrought proved to be the most effective work presented by danztectonic on friday night at the merce cunningham studio a cloth tower dominated tribute to the victims of the wtc disaster as it glowed in john musall 's lighting its fabric rippled and nayo takasaki the company 's director and choreographer was dimly visible behind it the fabric trembled with increasing force until the tower collapsed upon ms takasaki and she wrapped the cloth around her like a shroud because at no time could one see her face she seemed an archetypal figure symbolizing the ghost of a building and the ghosts of those who died in it two other pieces in this evening of premieres were much less effective in where we are the company 's dancers stephani achuff rachel bernsen maria holm and jennifer ruggiero kept walking back and forth while two musicians taylor ho bynum and ehran elisha marched with them playing a variety of instruments as the performers came and went they rearranged a set of movable rectangular shapes all this lacked any apparent sense of purpose and the work soon grew choreographically anemic the same dancers and musicians appeared in the equally bland joy which was dedicated to the choreographer 's mother a kindergarten teacher the stage was dominated by a construction resembling an enormous playpen the dancers wiggled coyly inside and around it and dismantled and reassembled its parts but they did everything so dutifully that joy never conveyed any sense of pleasure real children would have had much more fun in this playpen
