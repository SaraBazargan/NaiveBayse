faced with 12000 applicants for 1200 freshman slots the united states naval academy was blunt about its refusal to send a california high school senior an admissions application at the present time your college board tests do not indicate sufficient academic achievement for you to be designated an official candidate and receive an application packet said the letter late last fall from an admissions official to the student daniel wurangian of john f kennedy high school in granada hills outside los angeles mr wurangian had an excellent grade point average and was a battalion commander in the naval junior reserve officers training corps program at kennedy high but the letter said that unless he could do better on standardized exams reaching at least 530 on the verbal part of the sat i and 570 in math or scoring 22 on the english section of the act exam and 24 on the math he could not apply the letter obtained by fairtest an organization that critically monitors the use of standardized tests in college admissions lifts a corner on an aspect of higher education admissions that is usually cloaked in euphemism and ambiguity while a number of selective colleges and universities have long been presumed to demand minimum scores of their applicants the policy is seldom articulated and appears to violate guidelines by the tests makers that discourage using the scores alone as a predictor of college success critics also contend that because women score lower on the exams than men and african americans and latinos lower than whites and asian americans using a cutoff score to screen applicants typically results in a less diverse student body chiara coletti a spokeswoman for the college board said its guidelines recommend that schools guard against using minimum scores unless they use it with other information the act guidelines are similar ms coletti said some colleges and universities had done validity studies to profile the kinds of students likely to do well at their institutions such profiles she said typically include minimum sat scores but only along with high school grades and other information cmdr william spann a spokesman for the naval academy acknowledged that it had done no validity tests to shape its use of standardized exams the academy uses the scores to prequalify candidates for admission commander spann said though it makes exceptions on a selected basis in the best interest of the naval services he added that this year 's incoming class was the most diverse yet 25 percent of the new midshipmen are minority students and 15 percent are women latinos account for 10 percent of the class he said and african americans about 7 percent commander spann said students denied admissions applications could nevertheless request an interview in their home state with a representative of the academy at these meetings he said they can make their case for exceptions but the letter to mr wurangian who is asian and latino offers no such option further he said his is a high school typically overlooked on college night the recruiters who come calling are from vocational schools and the military not four year colleges and universities i was a bit angry at the letter said the 18 year old mr wurangian who took the test four times and in his best result scored just over 1000 nearly 100 points lower than the minimum the academy required i did n't think they gave me a fair evaluation of my true capabilities so he called annapolis to tell the admissions office there about his record a 364 grade point average and four years as a cadet in the naval junior reserve officers training corps in which he served as battalion commander the top cadet at his school during his senior year his dream he told the admissions counselor who had written the letter was to be a naval aviator but the counselor echoed the letter calling the sat an effective predictor of success mr wurangian said i asked him 'how do you know mr wurangian recalled 'if you only admit people who meet your minimum score requirements maybe there are others who might also have the potential to be exceptional leaders
