two years ago everyone from electric company bosses to president vladimir v putin was predicting catastrophe for 2003 the year was to be russia 's own y2k a mass of foreign debt would push russia back into bankruptcy the country 's infrastructure its vast electricity grid telephone networks oil and gas pipelines and roads would have aged to a critical point creating a drag on the economy and even emergency breakdowns and a shrinking population would reach the point where pensioners outnumbered the young in short russia had three short years to repair rebuild repay and reproduce mr putin addressed his cabinet on the matter shortly after a series of seemingly preventable accidents a fire in moscow 's main television tower and the sinking of the kursk nuclear submarine mr putin set up a 2003 problem commission of members of parliament newspaper headlines predicted disaster after the fire and the kursk 's sinking which left 118 sailors dead the weekly argumenti i fakti wrote it 's as if we 've angered the gods another weekly delovie lyudi wrote procrastination is no longer like death it is death but with 2003 fast approaching the danger seems to have faded the economy is growing russia 's central bank reserves are at their high since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 and more than quadruple the level of four years ago the budget is in surplus for the third straight year companies are investing and worker productivity is up 7 percent this year there is real restructuring of companies and this is continuing to drive russia said peter boone head of research at brunswick ubs warburg an investment bank in moscow reserves are so large they are dripping out of the central bank what one might ask went right russia politically and economically dysfunctional as little as four years ago is evolving toward being a respected member of the world community financial self sufficiency has eliminated the danger of a government debt crisis helped by the high price of crude oil a big export the government has set aside extra cash to help it make debt payments this year and next it has also bought back about a quarter of the foreign debt it owes next year as a result russia will be paying 155 billion in foreign debt in 2003 down from more than 20 billion for a third straight year the russian government is set to meet all its debt payments without real risk of default or help from foreign lenders all indications are that there is a lot of money coming into russia said roland nash head of research at renaissance capital an investment bank in moscow the increase in central bank reserves this year is huge concern about the 2003 problem did serve to propel a central economic reform the reorganization of russia 's vast electricity industry while predictions of the industry 's collapse were overstated international financial institutions like the european bank for reconstruction and development have said that russian electricity needs investment to modernize but such changes have been slow to move through parliament bogged down in arguments over how the plan to split apart the world 's largest electricity grid will be carried out demographic worries have been eased by a recent census a preliminary count showed that russia 's population has shrunk by two million over the last decade even as russians returned from republics of the former soviet union the decline which brought russia 's population to 145 million was less than originally feared also a recent report of an upturn in the birthrate gave cause for optimism and as russia emerges from a decade long economic slump the birthrate may continue to recover and the death rate to decline economists said a danger is in the fluctuation of the price of oil the lifeblood of russia 's budget which receives a third of its revenue from oil and gas russia 's economy is more diversified than that of the largest oil exporter saudi arabia but is still prone to boom and bust swings as the commodity price of crude oil rises and falls mr boone of brunswick ubs warburg contends that as long as the price of oil is at least 19 a barrel the government 's budget will not need adjusting and large oil companies will continue investment programs that have been central to the current economic expansion even so russia would feel the pinch if oil prices which have averaged about 25 a barrel this year fell a prolonged period of low prices would slow growth every dollar in the oil price is equal to just over 1 billion in federal revenue yet few expect a debt crisis from companies or government as both have maintained low levels of borrowing since the damaging default in the summer of 1998 in a move welcomed by economists because it would give russia 's federal budget a much needed injection of cash the russian government announced this month that it would once again try to sell a 59 percent stake in lukoil the country 's largest oil company four months earlier the government called off the sale because the prices offered were too low but the company 's shares have since climbed significantly the russian federal property fund the trustee for the state 's industrial shareholdings said the sale would reduce the state 's stake in lukoil to 76 percent it gave no details on the timing of the new sale the shares are intended to be offered in the form of american depositary receipts but will be sold on the london stock exchange in addition to the lukoil stake the russian government plans to sell 74 percent of one of its last fully owned oil companies slavneft this week many economists in russia argue that a low oil price would be good for the economy because it would force the country to develop other leading industries a more diverse economy would be stronger and less dependent on the fickle oil market in russia our natural resources are our blessing and our tragedy grigory a yavlinsky leader of the liberal yabloko political party said at an energy conference this fall they help us to develop but they keep us from developing for the time being he added russia 's economy is still fairly dependent on oil our economic model is like a drug addict with a gas pipe in one hand and an oil pipe in the other mr yavlinsky said high prices bring a lot of hallucinations but if prices fall the withdrawal is painful correction december 18 2002 wednesday because of an editing error an article in the special outlook issue of business day on monday about the russian economy included outdated references to moscow 's sale of a 59 percent stake
