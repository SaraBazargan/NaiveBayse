andy pettitte could have pitched sunday against the kansas city royals he could have taken the mound with the muscle strain below his left armpit and he may have pitched without aggravating the injury but rather than risk having the nagging injury become something more serious pettitte was placed on the 15 day disabled list retroactive to april 8 to replace pettitte on their roster the yankees promoted darrell einertson a right handed reliever with a hard sinking fastball einertson may only be with the yankees a few days another starting pitcher will be needed to take pettitte 's place sunday and jason grimsley may come out of the bullpen or ed yarnall or jake westbrook will be called up to throw with einertson returning to class aaa pettitte pitched tremendously in spring training saying at one point that his success was scary and that he wished the season was starting but during an exhibition game against the cleveland indians pettitte ducked to avoid a broken bat flying near the mound and strained the muscle he has made all of his scheduled appearances since then and has mostly been unaffected by the injury however pettitte tends to feel the strain when he reaches 75 to 80 pitches in the middle innings he lasted five innings in his last start in seattle before being replaced pettitte argued to stay on the active roster but he has dealt with manager joe torre long enough to know that he almost uniformly treats injuries conservatively especially this early in the season it 's the same old answer pettitte said of his talk with torre 'why take a chance catchers argue differently the complaints of catchers are usually hidden by posture if they do not like an umpire 's call on balls and strikes catchers will stare straight ahead at the pitcher and speak aloud never turning their heads so that they do not reveal the argument to observers and possibly escalate the disagreement so it was unusual to see jorge posada the yankees catcher stand and take off his mask to argue with the umpire tim timmons on wednesday in the third inning of the yankees home opener posada and timmons were disagreeing so loudly pitcher david cone joked afterward that he thought he might have to descend from the mound to step in between them it is usually viewed as sound politics for a catcher to restrain his arguments because of the risk of angering the umpire cone said he appreciated that posada stood up for him working hard for me lobbying to get calls joe girardi who usually served as cone 's catcher in recent seasons but is now with the chicago cubs was more diplomatic in making his arguments cone said you hardly knew when he was doing it cone said jorge is a little more emotional i appreciate the fact he is trying to get me going he takes a lot of pride in how he catches and how we do as pitchers when he catches he wants badly to do well he 's as frustrated as i am with my first two outings posada said he argued with timmons after one pitch that went right down the middle a call with the count 2 balls and 1 strike when cone was fighting back from a poor start i was just asking where the pitch was posada said he 's pretty good behind the plate he just missed that call and i was asking him about it it 's not that i 'm getting mad at him i was just asking him very kindly if it 's low or it 's away or if i 'm in the way if he wants me to hold the ball i was just talking to him joe torre a former catcher asked posada about the exchange after he returned to the dugout according to torre there may have been a misunderstanding about the count and he might have gotten carried away a little bit torre said of the argument it was sort of wrong of both parties and that might have been why the umpire did n't do anything normally when you turn around like that the umpire will let you know about it
