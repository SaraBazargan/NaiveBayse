the onetime football star is of the opinion that sports are becoming too mean spirited too violent but he admits that his brother the pastor is a professional wrestling fan i believe most adults can get excited can yell 'kill and go back to their lives without carrying it with them said lin dawson the former new england patriots tight end turned educator and conflict resolution counselor but from 10 years of working with kids of reading every study i could find on violence and how it affects children as they grow up i know that they can not make that separation of what is the show and what is real so he believes that professional sports which reach millions of children who then get the opportunity to try playing themselves have a greater responsibility than the general entertainment industry to keep their product legitimate positive grounded in the game he fears conversely that the tide of commercialism may be driving deep into the territory of common sense and a game altering touchdown may be coming soon welcome to 2001 a potential watershed year in the odyssey of american athletes across the shrinking divide between tawdry culture and true competition with the 2000 retrospectives completed we may now look forward to this year 's highlights not yet recorded and the cheerleader video already online for accessible starters that would be via the web site of the memphis maniax a purported football franchise in the start up xfl otherwise known as the tonya harding story rewritten for young male consumption want a sneak preview cheerleaders in the shower and daddy wants some popcorn are among the available peep shows currently mixed with less revealing league fanfare in the burgeoning field of in your face of sexploitation you 'd better believe we ai n't seen nothing yet the league which makes its debut next month is the brainchild of vince mcmahon in ratings driven partnership with nbc bad as his established empire is do n't blame the buffed wrestling impresario entirely for what promises to be lower than lowbrow sport this time the mountain has come to mcmahon this time mcmahon is merely the enabler of a sports world turning itself inside out in search of every last dollar if this is where we are as a society we 'd better stop fooling ourselves said dawson in his first year as athletic director at north carolina central university because we 're at the point where the value of the dollar outweighs the legitimacy of sport and that 's really dangerous when you 're talking about kids it is hard enough when the confusing or downright misogynic messages rampant in the music industry cross over in the form of an allen iverson rap song it is difficult enough to explain to a child why adult spectators are irresistibly drawn to a hockey fight in the middle of an otherwise compelling game now here comes an entire so called mainstream sports league predicated on the wrestling shock culture of mcmahon and validated by a network big boy like dick ebersol this was inevitable given the stretching of the television spectrum the urgency for programming and the espn x games formula that if you 're short make it up dress it up better yet as far as women are concerned take it off and let 's do something really sporting for that target audience known as the young male demographic so persecuted by field leveling contrivances like title ix forget the ix and give him an x with something like the xfl beyond the violence there are a lot of possibilities of significant sexism the objectification of women in sports and that 's something we believed we were moving away from richard lapchick said as the longtime director of the center for the study of sport in society on the northeastern university campus in boston lapchick helped dawson earn his college degree and then hired him to the eventual post of associate director for the center they created the acclaimed teamwork leadership initiative while dawson took to leading teams of counselors into schools gang ruled neighborhoods anywhere young people might listen though dawson 41 last worked for the center in the mid 1990 's he and lapchick have continued a nationwide college outreach program he recognizes what an american phenomenon wrestling has become and will be far less surprised than distressed if the pro football version draws copious amounts of fans live and at home xfl will probably pick up a whole range of people black and white poor and middle class with the same formula they use in wrestling dawson said but you bring this mentality to mainstream sports and you suddenly have a generation of kids carrying it over to adulthood growing up thinking that 's what it 's supposed to be will all the games eventually dumb down dawson said pro basketball and hockey selling primarily to an affluent whiter audience will have to at least strive for civility but what happens if the xfl formula scores while the viewing audiences for the more established leagues continue to decline what if the lines between titillation and convention continue to blur what happens when a genuine competitive quality becomes no more important than the spectacle itself for a generation of young people raised as armchair voyeurs and taken by camera and microphone into the huddle the locker room and yes the cheerleaders shower welcome to 2001 when vince mcmahon begins pounding on a monolith that may have even more cracks than are visible to the eye
