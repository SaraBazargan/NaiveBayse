bush vs the beltway how the cia and the state department tried to stop the war on terror by laurie mylroie 258 pp new york reganbooks harpercollins publishers 2595 the initial failure of american forces to find conclusive evidence of saddam hussein 's programs to develop weapons of mass destruction or of baghdad 's connections to al qaeda has led to a furious debate in washington over the bush administration 's handling of prewar intelligence president bush 's use of 16 words in his state of the union speech has been endlessly dissected while charges have been flying that vice president cheney pressured cia analysts and exaggerated the threat iraq posed to the united states so this would be a good time for a thoughtful book providing a vigorous defense of the administration and the case for war preferably it would be written by one of the many pundits academics and former government officials who in the months before the war followed the white house 's lead and worked hard to shape public opinion in favor of the invasion laurie mylroie an adjunct fellow at the american enterprise institute was a charter member of that group and has now become one of the first to publish a book dealing with iraq since the war ended but readers hoping that bush vs the beltway would address cogently the questions that have been raised about the nature of the intelligence that led president bush to war will be sorely disappointed instead mylroie has provided us with a rather odd little polemic and a score settling one at that she uses the book to lash out at the ideological losers of the prewar period the central intelligence agency and the state department saving her greatest wrath for the nation 's spy service most observers will recall that the white house and pentagon easily steamrolled over the few pockets of institutional resistance in washington on the drive to baghdad yet mylroie seems to believe that the national security bureaucrats very nearly derailed the war and only the certitude of the president himself carried the day if that were true and if the tale were well told you 'd have the basis for a dramatic narrative but mylroie offers few inside details or juicy new revelations instead she rehashes old information and stretches its significance as a result these pages come across as an exercise in dead horse kicking to be sure it is hard to go wrong criticizing the cia these days when it comes to the agency a russian saying seems apt if you see a bulgarian on the street beat him he will know why after sept 11 now widely regarded as the greatest american intelligence failure since pearl harbor any dart thrown in the general direction of langley va is bound to hit a cia officer who has somehow messed up even so mylroie comes at the agency from a skewed angle of attack its greatest sin she proposes is that it mulishly refused to agree that iraq was behind the sept 11 attacks if it had she suggests then president bush would have been saved the trouble of worrying about iraq 's efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction not that she doubts that the weapons were there but if sept 11 had been recognized as a plot hatched in baghdad then there would have been a clear cut case for war one not fought pre emptively but in self defense mylroie complains that the cia seems to have been duped into believing that al qaeda is a loose knit group of islamic extremists and that the agency 's analysts have turned a collective blind eye to the evidence suggesting that al qaeda could well be a front organization for iraqi intelligence she believes that iraq was behind almost every major terrorist attack of the past decade dating back to the first bombing of the world trade center in 1993 what has the cia overlooked that she has n't here mylroie slips offering speculation in place of solid evidence she suggests that key qaeda leaders who have been captured by the united states may only be posing as qaeda leaders they could actually be iraqi intelligence agents who are way way undercover khalid shaikh mohammed al qaeda 's chief of operations and the mastermind of the sept 11 attacks and who is now in american custody may not really be khalid shaikh mohammed he could be an iraqi intelligence agent secretly sent to run al qaeda by saddam hussein ramzi yousef the man behind the first world trade center bombing and a 1995 plot to blow up american airliners over the pacific who now sits in a federal prison also may be an iraqi agent both mohammed and yousef who are related are kuwaitis originally from the baluchistan region of pakistan and their papers and their identities could have been stolen for use by iraqi intelligence agents during baghdad 's occupation of kuwait in 1990 mylroie offers no proof that such a switch did take place in the case of yousef she neatly leaps from one assumption to the next down a convoluted paper trail she puts great stock in the fact that people who knew mohammed when he was a student in north carolina in the 1980 's thought he was nice and find it hard to believe he became a world class terrorist could that mean it was not really the same person unlike most cub reporters it seems mylroie has never been sent out to talk to the neighbors of a murderer and been told he was a quiet man the cia 's refusal to pursue this line of reasoning mylroie implies has led american counterterrorist officials on a wild goose chase of global proportions hunting down islamic extremists when they should have focused their energies on iraqi intelligence operatives the cia 's other unpardonable sin is its reluctance to do business with ahmad chalabi an iraqi exile leader who was adopted by the pentagon after the agency ended its stormy relationship with his organization in the 1990 's the book is peppered with little digs at midlevel government officials like the cia 's former near east division chief steven richter who lacked the vision to see that chalabi represented iraq 's future one lesson from bush vs the beltway is that in the wake of its historic failure on sept 11 which left nearly 3000 americans dead the cia has so much to account for that it has to get used to taking whatever criticism comes its way in the meantime readers will have to wait for another book to try to explain a more recent intelligence flap the one having to do with those missing weapons of mass destruction james risen is the author with milt bearden of the main enemy the inside story of the cia 's final showdown with the kgb he covers national security for the times
