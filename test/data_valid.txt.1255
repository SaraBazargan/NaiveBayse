heroin and other poems by charlie smith 95 pp new york w w norton company 22 some scholars think the drug helen of troy gives to the grieving warriors in book iv of the odyssey may have been opium the poppy plant derivative whose lineage includes morphine codeine and heroin in homer 's words the drug banishes all care sorrow and ill humor today the relationship between sorrow and its premier anodyne remains the same apparently the anguished warrior in menelaus palace and the addict in a rat filled basement are likely to make the same choice as they sink into what charlie smith calls the despair nothing but a drug could put to rest the poems in heroin smith 's new collection explore an unnamed narrator 's struggles with and eventual recovery from heroin addiction and they are as mournful as any song hank williams wrote and often as lovely smith 's narrator never ties off in a tenement room or urban alley though stereotypes to the contrary he says in the title poem that i was one of the few rural junkies in the nation one of the few who tended cattle there i was nodding on a rock as the cows stiff with unendurable shyness stumbled up to me the drugs came from vietnam to guam to fort ord to norfolk va where they were delivered in a nylon medic 's bag by a friend who worked for the railroad labeled with power car names like corvette grand prix and le mans the heroin was the only thing that filled the hole that gaped in his narrator smith writes like a pocketbook torn open by a thief in another poem this man says he came to feel that his life was snarled like a deer in a fence this was some years ago evidently and these poems seem to be written from the point of view of someone who has successfully untangled himself but even though the voice that speaks throughout this book is calm to the point of philosophical it relates the quotidian horrors of an addict 's life in a way that suggests that opportunities for mayhem are never very distant every schoolkid knows why you should n't use drugs in a sense these poems explain why you should use them though the endorsements arrive in a whirlwind of sensations that include elation anesthesia and a sorrow so profound the narrator seems barely capable of admitting it i loved the graciousness of heroin the way everything externalized and obvious in the daylight opened its shirt and revealed its soft pale breasts the world slept curled in its own foolhardiness and my wife came carefully over the blankets to me and seemed not to mind who i was smith 's poems have their own direct earthy appeal but there are moments here when his lines recall charles wright 's breathy transcendence as when he writes i am unable to bring myself to speak to anyone or perhaps i speak abruptly to a clerk in a store where i buy a cup of coffee and walk away afraid i have been harsh with him which is the greatest sin yet i would like to stop someone and say i have been in love like you or i think there is a divine expression coming through all things no matter how ridiculous they seem but i am unable to do this i simply keep walking but while wright often seems to have achieved already the whitmanesque rapture he articulates smith 's narrator has to struggle to get there and the struggle takes up the greater part of many of these poems his is a world in which everyone is doing the best he can to keep the dark from climbing over his back smith 's best poems transcend the issue of addiction and address a larger class of tribulations that are the dna of literature precisely because in a there but for the grace of god way they are so potent and frightening some are simply about the act of doing something stupid or shameful some days the rage like a fire in the back of the house burning up the baby clothes after you 're so spent and ragged out with misery you set a fire in the pump room pour kerosene over the little playsuits and blue bunny pants your mother sent and stand there stoned crying saying impossible impossible not all of these poems are about heroin it 's well known that addicts can be regular users and still hold down jobs and lead useful lives but most of them are about pain and by concentrating on the pain his narrator sought to medicate rather than on the medicine itself smith allows readers access to these poems and the frustrations that underlie them smith 's poems read like casual expressions of hard won wisdom as if they had been written quickly after months of contemplation his previous collection before and after 1995 is a sort of portrait album of a dysfunctional family and in those poems each suicidal cousin or insane parent is captured in images so stunning that often they transcend the frightening realities they describe in heroin however it 's almost as though the artist thought too much art would glamorize a subject that should n't lend itself to glamour certainly there is no romanticizing of drug use in these poems no exotic allure just beneath the squalor there are however moments of sun dappled beauty in smith 's field of stone gray stoicism several poems offer extended catalogs of a few of his narrator 's favorite things from trees and flowers to beds beds i have knelt beside and dreamed of even these poems seem a little nervous though as if to remind us that we do n't really know what beauty is until we 've looked hard at the horror that throws beauty into bright relief david kirby is the w guy mckenzie professor of english at florida state university and author of the house of blue light a book of poems
