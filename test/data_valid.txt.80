it 's a familiar drill if you 're the parent of a summer camper when the camp session ends you rush in full of teary hugs and hometown gossip gather up your sunburned sleep deprived child make sure you 've excavated the odd t shirt and cd wedged behind her bunk wait as she vows eternal e mail loyalty to her 17 new best friends and make a quick exit even if it 's say a tennis camp the routine 's pretty much the same there 's no formal display of that new and improved backhand to demonstrate to parents that they 've gotten their money 's worth but if you 've got a budding musician or actor in the family and have sent her off to a performing arts camp brace yourself for a different scene entirely or let me put it this way do n't make any other plans for a single minute of that weekend take our 16 year old songbird she knows she 's going to be a performer a pop singer perhaps or a broadway star but definitely a performer so it had to be a performing arts camp when we ventured to her camp in the southern catskills after she had had three weeks crammed with musical rehearsals and dance classes sprinkled with the standard tennis and swimming we were treated to a whirlwind of performances but let 's get the statistics out of the way to make this breathlessly clear in a mere day and a half we saw a circus a dance recital with our daughter in it an orchestra recital and four yes four full length musicals one with our daughter singing and tap dancing away and we did n't see half the shows available when we arrived about noon saturday she was nowhere in sight she must be at the 'anything goes rehearsal one bunkmate advised another offered no i think she 's at a dance class or again maybe she 's at the circus my wife and i dashed about the bustling camp where youngsters were hurrying around in various costumes with music of all sorts wafting from various buildings until at last we found her but we had little time for idle talk there was a musical she said that we had to see and it started in 15 minutes we all rushed off to that after which she had to go and get into her costume for one of her performances even more amazing than the number of events the camp packed in such a short time was the quality of most of them the camp clearly draws talented musicians and directors who welcome a chance to work lakeside in the summer and the campers abound with talent too back home a big fish in a little pond our daughter gets good roles but here surrounded by aspiring stars she is just one of the pack how did the camp achieve the minor scheduling miracle of shoehorning so many shows into a weekend for one thing it did n't put a high priority on things like say dinner after the late afternoon musical went into the dinner hour the camp director announced that a special dinner was being set up for us this consisted of our waiting in line for a slice of pizza but no matter soon it was off to the evening musical finally late at night we made the long drive on the dark country road back to our distant hotel there were closer hotels but they must be booked up to a year in advance for performance weekends four months earlier i had started calling hotels for a reservation thinking i was clever to get such an early start the first seven hotels either laughed at me or hung up with barely disguised disdain when i mentioned the dates finally casting my net ever wider i found a room on sunday we were back for another round of performances and finally after another jam packed day we got to that long awaited search for the odd sock and cd the teary farewells and headed wearily home but it was well worth it when your child has this particular yearning and pesky things like homework distract her from the high school musical a performing arts camp is an ideal place to let these juices flow soapbox hubert b herring an editor at the times lives in dobbs ferry
