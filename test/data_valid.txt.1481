sugar busters for kids by dr sam s andrews dr luis a balart dr morrison c bethea and dr h leighton steward ballantine books 2395 your body your diet by dr elizabeth dane ballantine books 2595 the authors of sugar busters for kids somewhat sternly point out that their book is not a diet book at all rather the authors prefer to call their book a positive approach to a healthy lifestyle but whether diet refers to typical food intake or an eating system is semantic quibbling sugar busters for kids modifies a concept by the authors in their 1998 diet book for adults minimizing the elevation of blood sugars and insulin levels to address the requirements of children essentially the program involves reduced intake of refined sugar more fiber and a drastic cutback in highly processed and fast foods in particular there 's avoidance of what the authors call the terrible trio sugar sweetened soft drinks one drink has double the amount of added sugar that should be consumed in a day french fries a serving can contain over 25 grams of fat and 50 grams of carbohydrates and candy still the authors have to admit a fact of parental life given a choice between a sugary greasy fast food spree and a sugar busting meal of tofu chili tortillas or a plate of red beans and brown rice we all know what children will head for but the book holds out hope good eating habits the writers say can be formed if parents regain control of nutrition at home insist on family dinners abolish snacking and dining in front of the television and phase in the right food substitutes the book is full of recipes for things like mango chicken whole wheat pizza and zucchini stir fry all designed to prove that healthy food need not taste bad dr dane 's book is described as a complete program for losing weight boosting energy and being your best self a nutrition and lifestyle guide that also depends on food formulas that properly balance carbohydrates protein and fat but its framework stretches further its author is a practitioner of complementary medicine with a phd in chinese medicine and philosophy and the book includes such alternative arcana as yang accelerators yin synthesizers stress buster aromatherapy formulas balsamic strawberries and a call to arms weight buster morning drink of ginger capsicum flaxseed oil apple cider vinegar kelp and honey in a base of thankfully fresh spring water doubtless much good nutrition science is presented here if one can separate it from the author 's distracting comments about glands that make you swing and sway your sex glands and from the wisdom of the ancients who in all their wisdom were hardly ever known for weight loss programs we may indeed be made up of a combination of energies but let 's face it diets are diets are diets as montesquieu put it that kind of health which can be preserved only by a careful and constant regulation of diet is but a tedious disease
