the august issue of marie claire a fashion and beauty magazine jointly owned by hearst magazines and the french company marie claire album promises 1132 new looks sexy steals to buy now not 1131 or 1133 but 1132 oh for the simpler days of 8 new fall looks you ca n't resist lesley jane seymour editor in chief of marie claire said the reason that the magazine had broken the four digit barrier on a cover featuring exactly one julia stiles was that she and the other editors counted the new looks sexy steals and 1132 was the number they came up with an informal effort to see if the magic number was really accurate died out somewhere from the moschino cheap and chic ring no 383 give or take to the rampage obi belt no 600 something but ms seymour said the number was very real and real important you know that your reader is looking for stuff we are crammed with stuff and we want to let her know how much stuff is in that issue ms seymour explained marie claire is primarily a newsstand magazine selling more than 600000 of its average circulation of 925000 in single copies rather than by subscription so designing a cover that appeals to a lot of prospective readers is critical to the franchise cover numerology has taken on a life and a momentum of its own originally big numbers were restricted to the woman 's service category where a magazine like woman 's day would feature 212 baking tips but now the same math is being applied to fendi bags and jimmy choo shoes lovingly displayed in all sorts of women 's magazines from harper 's bazaar 's 635 fashion ideas to cosmogirl 's 456 ways to look amazing this fall most of the women 's set has been chastely hovering in the hundreds but now that marie claire has broken through the thousand barrier three times now   there is no telling where the number escalation might end ms seymour who said she made it to third year calculus in college explained that plain old words were not enough in today 's highly competitive newsstand environment it is partly a design trick at this point she said words can be a little fuzzy after awhile and numbers are another way to get at what we are trying to say bonnie fuller editor of us weekly and a former practitioner of covers by numbers when she ran marie claire as well as cosmopolitan glamour and ym said she thought the numbers arms race was a reflection of the technique 's success i think it 's the promise of a lot of choice and if you have got a lot of choices for your reader that is going to be something in there for her ms fuller said david carr
