on july 22 my birthday i got up to go to the bathroom took 10 steps heard a rumble turned around and watched a 2000 pound steel beam fall across my bed then the roof peeled off then the wall collapsed showering the room with bricks cinder blocks and mortar my boxer shorts flapping wildly from a headboard knob flew to a lamppost two blocks away where they hung for two days like a flag of defeat until i reclaimed them this was in memphis and this was not a tornado weather people use a spanish word for the thing derecho meaning a windstorm with staying power straight line wind is another term forecasters employ a derecho usually calls on the northern plains we rarely get a visit down south this one rose from a squall line in kansas gathered strength in the night as it crossed arkansas then hit us at dawn at 100 miles an hour i live on the mississippi river on front street the derecho ran over me first traveling southeast it wrought the predictable damage of a monster storm our town lost one out of three of its majestic oaks or at least it seemed to me more than 300000 homes and businesses lost power a million people many of those in the dark like my parents were in the dark for two weeks sadly our good fortune was that only a handful of people were killed but for 10 steps to the loo it would have been one more i got my share of publicity out of it a news photographer up in a chopper took a picture of me in my rubble and it occupied three fifths of the front page of the local morning paper a neighbor told a reporter that i had just moved in on the fourth of july that it was my birthday that the poor man was blown across the room the same picture ran on page 13 of the times the next day other than wire service reports that was just about all the national ink we got a three column photograph of me in my roofless loft along with a four sentence caption i mean come on we had surgeons working with flashlights in their teeth as we had no lights for days we had ordinary citizens directing traffic sound familiar this was un air conditioned memphis in july no memphian perished from the heat it 's what you 're used to i guess it 's what i grew up with there was hardship there were frantic runs on generators food water ice if you could find ice you were rationed to two five pound bags all over memphis a barbecue mecca you smelled meat on charcoal grills people were emptying their freezers trying desperately to stay ahead of spoilage offering you ribeyes and hams and chickens but everyone had their own and could not possibly consume more my mother who cans preserves and freezes homegrown vegetables and fruit lost a ton but did not cry more important to save my father who has emphysema we managed to run an extension cord to the gas driven generator in the backyard of the neighbor next door did i say that my parents were without power for two weeks in the darkened supermarkets that valiantly opened their doors where the frozen foods sections were off limits behind yellow police tape to keep the customers from risking illness very old cashiers made change out of cigar boxes without an electronic cash register which does all the work the young employees were not up to the task we kept waiting for the national press to take notice after all these stories were rich and pictures power lines down and streets so scattered and blocked with trees and poles that it looked like the wreck of wooden train but no correspondents found us we missed the news cycle mayor willie herenton kept ringing the bell but no one outside the city limits heard after dealing with insurance agents and contractors for several weeks i left my demolished river home and returned to new york city where i also have a house two days later blackout everyone everywhere knows about that on the phone a sarcastic friend in memphis said poor souls out of power for a whole day then my depression baby mother called i 've been glued to cnn for 24 hours she said my heart goes out to y'all gregory jaynes is a former correspondent and columnist for the times
