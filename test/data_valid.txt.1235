like many great ideas this one was born of an argument the discussion started simply enough who is the best skier on the mountain tommy corcoran a former olympic racer and owner of the waterville valley ski area in new hampshire 's white mountains said it had to be a local racer doug pfeiffer the editor of skiing magazine disagreed well acquainted with the nimble talented free spirits who strutted their stuff well outside competition guidelines pfeiffer proposed that the mountain 's best skier was someone banging through moguls launching himself off jumps for gravity defying acrobatic moves as historical arguments go heredity versus environment it was not unless you are a skier you can still ignite this argument in any lodge faster than you can get year old split wood burning in the fireplace in 1971 the conclusion of the corcoran pfeiffer debate was waterville valley 's decision to play host to the first national championship of what was then called exhibition skiing last weekend with a nod to the birthplace of what is now an olympic sport the chevy trucks united states freestyle championships returned to waterville valley with espn 's cameras rolling sponsorship banners flying and other attendant trappings of prosperity wayne wong a legendary figure in 1970 's exhibition skiing remembers seeing an advertisement for waterville valley 's initial competition in skiing magazine 30 years ago i was in college in vancouver and i had a big bag of tricks that i had invented wong said over the weekend i told myself 'i 'm going to show them stuff they 've never seen the rest is history wong with head over heels rolls in the snow slow motion turns high speed dashes through the mogul field and ballet like moves may have placed third in the inaugural competition but he helped spawn a new artistic animated and ingenious skiing crusade not that things took off right away i won 1000 that day which was a lot of money for a 21 year old college kid wong said but the winner got a car that 's what i wanted for wong and his contemporaries the cars they won became a way to measure success of the competitor and the budding freestyle circuit a really big winner on our circuit might have a corvette but an awful lot of guys were driving a chevy vega wong said chevrolet god bless them was our first big sponsor and they gave away a lot of vegas the members of the current united states freestyle team are living larger even if they are not paid as well as athletes from other major sports but they know they have got it made compared to their predecessors every one of us has gone up to those guys to express our appreciation for what they did for our sport said donna weinbrecht the 1992 olympic gold medalist in moguls who finished second at last weekend 's championships when i started in the 1980 's they were still part of the movement to get us recognized as an olympic sport hannah hardaway a 22 year old new hampshire native who won the women 's moguls is too young to remember wong in his prime but i 've heard the stories hardaway said it 's pretty cool to think they made up a sport from something fun to do most fascinating about last weekend 's event was the mix of the sport 's old and new wong and others put on an exhibition of some of their best maneuvers each highly creative winsome and individualistic but the next day in the aerial competition the athletic and technological advances were immediately apparent with competitors flying 50 feet in the air performing double somersaults and more the spectators many of them from waterville valley 's aptly named freestyle team the black and blue trail smashers would gasp then roar at the perfect landings the previous day might have been more entertaining but the aerials were breathtaking true to form the two segments of the event spawned another debate it 's wonderful to see how far these great athletes have taken the sport wong said i just hope they do n't forget why they got into this i hope they do n't forget the free in freestyle skiing it 's natural as a sport grows for it to become more regimented but i do n't like to see so many skiers look identical through the moguls i want to take the sterility out of skiing we used to have just two rules you have to start here and finish down there and you could do whatever you wanted in between there is nothing new to this argument the modern evolution of figure skating is criticized on similar grounds but sport tends to adapt there is for example a budding free skiing movement and at waterville valley there are bump runs and jumps all over the mountain with skiers and snowboarders bounding hither and dither with grace with guts and abundant eccentricity last weekend they might have been the best skiers on the mountain unless of course it was the racers training on the other side of the mountain you have got to love a good argument
