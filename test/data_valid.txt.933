eight years ago the al munaif family slaughtered sheep in tribute to one president bush as that leader was hailed as the liberator of kuwait during a 1993 visit in which he basked in adulation but by last year when a son was born to sara one of 11 al munaif children the young woman did not hesitate to choose a name meant to send a very different signal to the west the little boy is osama after osama bin laden we do n't like war said sara 's brother fahad 27 but we have our red lines it seems the americans only want to support israel and attack the muslims and if this is a war between christians and muslims we ought to fight the al munaifs from this middle class town 20 miles south of kuwait city the capital are hardly wild eyed radicals they are merchants from the al ajmi clan a powerful bedouin tribe fahad owns a rental car agency just a few steps from the sea his five brothers have businesses of their own but the family has not been immune from what most people here see as a souring of admiration for the united states as the gratitude that followed the persian gulf war of 1991 has been replaced by frustration and anger these feelings have deepened in recent weeks as the american war in afghanistan seems even to people who profess admiration for the united states to be proving one of mr bin laden 's points that americans seem bent on keeping muslims subservient i have never seen resentment toward the united states as much as i 've seen in the last few weeks said tareq m suwaidan a kuwaiti business consultant who lived for 17 years in the united states and now travels extensively through the gulf countries the amount of anger is just enormous my wife every time she sees bin laden on television she says 'i think he 's telling the truth said another man ali hassan murad a public relations manager at the kuwait petroleum corporation among the al munaifs sara had a good reason for naming her son osama her brother fahad said her husband salem was killed in chechnya where he was a volunteer among islamic fighters and had left instructions that if anything should happen to him his son should be named for mr bin laden he was very fanatical and he loved osama bin laden very much mr munaif said today along with its neighbors in the gulf kuwait 's strongly pro western government has offered qualified support for the american anti terrorism operation it has proclaimed itself a member of the global anti terrorism coalition and begun to shut down some of the more than 100 unlicensed charitable organizations that american officials say may have served to funnel support to mr bin laden and his al qaeda organization but even the government has stopped short of declaring support for an american military operation that many citizens see as unfeeling in its impact on afghan civilians and unjustified in zeroing in on mr bin laden whose connection with the sept 11 attacks is still seen as being in doubt in conversations around kuwait in offices and shops and the nighttime political and social gatherings known as diwaneyehs ordinary people said their good feelings toward the united states were eroding every day you are giving food to the afghans with one hand and killing them with the other hand said mahmoud al awadhi a consultant to the municipal government in fahaheel it 's a big mistake in arabic we have an expression 'if you lay a hand on a muslim the muslim will never let you go it was in fahaheel in a parking lot near a fish market that a canadian man was shot and killed in the first weeks of the crisis in a crime that kuwait authorities suspected had been committed by muslim militants the police have since offered a different explanation charging several filipinos who they said conspired in the murder with the dead man 's filipino wife but their initial response in which a member of a leading islamist family was arrested seemed a gauge of the government 's concern about the depth of current anti western feelings mr awadhi 44 lived for several years in the united states as a student and a young professional he still carries in his wallet a massachusetts driver 's license which expired 11 years ago sitting at a table in a fast food restaurant he interspersed his remarks to an american with apologies lest he give offense during the gulf war he said he served as a volunteer with american combat forces who fought to drive iraq from kuwait later he was among the thousands of kuwaitis he said who turned out to welcome president george bush to kuwait during his triumphal visit in 1993 not long after he left the white house i think george bush the elder was a very smart man and he was very good at reading history mr awadhi said but like most other kuwaitis he said his feelings were much more mixed about the current bush in the white house george bush the son is very mysterious mr awadhi said we do n't know what he 's thinking what he 's doing what he intends in afghanistan and i have to say when i hear bin laden and he calls on muslims to stick together it 's easy for me to listen when he says look at east timor and bosnia and iraq and kashmir and afghanistan and asks 'why are most of the world 's problems in the muslim lands he makes a good point most of the power is in the west and the west still looks at the world in the christian way with muslims as their enemies one of his distant relatives mr awadhi said is slaiman abou ghaith the kuwaiti cleric who surfaced last month as a spokesman for mr bin laden in kuwait he is very gentle very good very honest mr awadhi said of mr abou ghaith whose citizenship has been revoked by kuwait which has denounced as traitorous the cleric 's ties to mr bin laden echoing estimates by government officials mr awadhi said he believed that at least several dozen other kuwaitis have joined al qaeda forces in afghanistan since the american attacks began but with the start of islam 's most holy month approaching mr awadhi said that may be only the beginning unless the conflict ends soon i hate to see it but i think during ramadan you will see millions of muslims going to fight he said as dozens of men outside hurried toward a nearby mosque for midday prayers they will be willing to kill themselves in the name of religion back in the capital in the white on white elegance of an official office inside kuwait 's national assembly a government spokesman dismissed such sentiments as complaints from a minority and insisted that most kuwaitis remained staunch supporters of american policies we give them the right to say what they want said sheik ahmad fahd al sabah the information minister and a member of the ruling family but in the end they will stick with the majority and the majority is with the united states
