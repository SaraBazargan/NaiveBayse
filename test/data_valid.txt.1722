marty schottenheimer had a singular goal when he became the washington redskins coach nearly 11 months ago to remake the struggling team into one with a winning image which happened to be his image in washington 's training camp last summer like a bungee jumper schottenheimer leaped toward that goal but the rope nearly snapped schottenheimer and his team nearly crashed the jump seemed safe to schottenheimer who in 15 seasons as coach of the browns and chiefs went to the playoffs 11 times but his players not only did not see a net they also did not see a coach or a style they liked take for instance schottenheimer in camp one day correcting the technique of darrell green the veteran redskins cornerback and icon this is green 's 19th and final season in the nfl all with washington green did not like schottenheimer 's manner of teaching his teammates many of them veterans did not like seeing green raked over either i 'm just in there working trying to get things right schottenheimer said today at the team 's training center i had no idea what i had done and how it affected the rest of the team and how about that hard nosed old oklahoma contact drill on the first day of camp i have always done that as a way of building camaraderie on my team schottenheimer said it was supposed to be fun but the players viewed the drill as another of schottenheimer 's old school ways ones they had heard about even before he arrived he likes to work his teams much too hard way too early he is unbending in his many rules and regulations giving his teams an army like atmosphere and structure soon the players began to sulk the losing began to roll and before long washington was 0 5 the joke of the league with rancor inside that was apparent outside well in football stuff is going to be stuff green said and you are going to have your logistical issues and personality issues but what was developing here was an us versus them thing between the players and coaches a limited boss worker relationship a working environment that was not good but what we have seen now is that change into a new atmosphere i 'm talking about the spirit of the place now it is healthy it is like a parent with his child he can tell him what to do be a friend and still draw a distinct line between who is the child and who is the parent and i think you have to give our coach credit for understanding that and our players credit for being willing to give it every chance the getting to know you session in washington looks complete and now the redskins more open to learning are gaining a handle on schottenheimer 's schemes and his blueprint for the way football should be played the result five straight victories the first time in league history that a team has lost its first five games then won its next five this is more than a turnabout a reversal of fortune a shedding of old skin it is as if the redskins had a sixth sense their offense runs the ball their defense is not only shuts teams down but also makes game swinging plays their special teams make an impact and the interlocking play among those three phases has helped make this team whole on sunday the redskins play host to dallas a team that has beaten them eight straight times but these redskins see no team they can not handle from 0 5 to a very good chance to become a playoff team all i know is when you 're 0 5 cornerback champ bailey said you 're not doing something right but what kept the redskins from continuing to spiral toward a 1 10 record like carolina 's or an 0 10 record like detroit 's after the fourth loss we sat down everybody included and just aired it out with coach said linebacker lavar arrington whose 67 yard interception return for a touchdown against carolina helped give washington its first victory i think people left that meeting feeling more a part of things the redskins players said schottenheimer took control and led them early on as if he were in say his eighth year with the team not his first the players said they were too resistant in some ways i had to figure out what makes each guy respond and i 'm still doing that schottenheimer said quarterback tony banks said his coach 's effort was working now in this town it 's 'marty for president the redskins are going to the super bowl and me i 'm just hoping i can be janitor he said laughing banks epitomizes the redskins fall and revival he bombed in st louis was rejected in baltimore and was cut by dallas in the preseason he arrived here and the redskins with jeff george as the starting quarterback in the first two games went on their five game spiral but banks has lately offered steady and courageous play so has the entire team the defense allowed 30 points or more three times during its losing streak but only once against the giants has it allowed more than 14 points in its winning streak running back stephen davis has rambled for 842 yards the kickoff returner michael bates is averaging 248 yards a return the punt returner eric metcalf is averaging 141 yards a return during their victories over carolina the giants seattle denver and philadelphia the redskins have forced 12 turnovers while giving the ball away only 6 times first and foremost people need to realize this was a good football team last year defensive end bruce smith the former bill in his second season with the redskins said of last season 's 8 8 team under coach norv turner we lacked some things in our special teams that hurt us especially at kicker you ca n't win in this league without a good kicker and brett conway has come back and given us that we 've got 11 guys on the field now ready to make plays on each side of the ball this right now is as good a locker room in chemistry as the great ones we had in buffalo during our super bowl runs line play has also solidified the redskins on the offensive side tackle chris samuels leads a crew that has become bullish on the defensive side end marco coleman and nose tackle dan wilkinson are anchors they are regarded as team leaders after facing dallas washington plays at arizona at home against philadelphia and chicago at new orleans then at home against arizona if the redskins run the table they will be 11 5 they will be national football conference east champions even a 10 6 record could get them into the playoffs in today 's brand of pro football championship teams find a mantra a rallying cry and ride it as far as it will last last season the baltimore ravens rallied behind ray lewis this season for the redskins the rallying cry has been of the 0 5 joke of a team that could i 'm not getting caught up into that playoff talk schottenheimer said i just want to work and for our team to work for us to be in a situation right now where we can control our own destiny after being 0 5 is a good thing every team in this league has limitations and we are not an exception but when you have good people good players and their confidence level is lifted you have a chance to do something special and we 've got good people that 's the testament to turning it around
