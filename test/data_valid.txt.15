westchester county executive andrew j spano called today for a 1 percent increase in the county sales tax after releasing midyear figures that showed a 328625 shortfall in sales tax revenue the first decline since 1998 westchester officials collected 1161 million from the sale of goods and services during the first half of this year a 03 percent decline from the same period in 2001 mr spano said the tax revenue was expected to continue shrinking even as the county faces much higher costs for state mandated health care programs the news is not good mr spano said the shaky national economy is causing people to spend less and that means we are losing vital sales tax dollars this does not bode well for next year westchester currently has a 675 percent sales tax one of the lowest in the state that rate does not include the cities of mount vernon new rochelle white plains and yonkers which impose their own sales taxes ranging from 775 to 825 percent the proposed increase would not affect those cities which are already at or near the limit of 825 percent set by the state constitution mr spano said the tax increase was more necessary than ever because it would generate an additional 100 million a year for the county of which 75 million would be used to pay for increased costs in state mandated health care programs he said the remaining 25 million would go to local school districts towns and villages to help alleviate their budget problems without the increase mr spano said the county would face a 102 million deficit in the 2003 budget he said the county 's other options would include drastically reducing services like closing parks and cutting day care for low income families and raising property taxes as much as 29 percent or more next year it 's ridiculous that county people should suffer because of having to pay for state programs he said county officials last raised the sales tax in 1991 when they also increased it by 1 percent excluding the cities the county 's share of the 675 percent sales tax is now 25 percentage points in the towns and villages and 15 percentage points in the cities about two thirds of the revenue from the last tax increase is given back to the schools towns and villages the proposed tax increase would require the approval of both the state and county legislatures a half dozen counties including neighboring rockland county have already sought and received approval from the state legislature to increase their sales taxes this year though mr spano and other county officials have approached the westchester delegation of state legislators they have been unable to get its support for raising the tax state assemblyman richard l brodsky a leader of the delegation said the county legislative body as a whole had not requested approval of a tax increase though individuals had come forward to support or oppose it in other counties he said the requests came from the legislatures not the county executive mr brodsky also said he was concerned that the tax increase would be imposed only in some municipalities for the benefit of the entire county it would be like putting a tax just on queens to benefit all of new york city he said susan tolchin chief adviser to mr spano said the proposed increase was no different than the one that had been approved by state legislators in 1991 mr brodsky is simply playing games she said
