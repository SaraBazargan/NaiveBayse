with a deadline of new year 's eve nearly upon them water officials from across southern california held talks today on an agreement that would avert a showdown with the federal government over water from the colorado river there were several indications that progress had been made though officials warned that the negotiations were tentative and delicate the bush administration has said that if no agreement is reached by midnight on tuesday it will reduce water flows to farms and urban areas in southern california beginning on wednesday we have been meeting continually day and night throughout the weekend and the holidays said dennis cushman an assistant general manager at the san diego county water authority one of four water agencies involved in the talks things are happening now whether they bode for a successful outcome it is still too early to tell in the most obvious sign of progress the bush administration 's top official on water policy arrived in california today on an unscheduled visit after negotiations by telephone from washington the official bennett w raley an assistant secretary of the interior decided on sunday night to make the trip after it became apparent that the parties were close enough to make it worth going said a spokesman kip white mr raley and negotiators from the four water agencies were meeting at the headquarters of the metropolitan water district of southern california the los angeles based agency that will suffer the biggest cut if the talks fail mr raley 's arrival was seen as important by the california water agencies because the department of the interior which regulates flows from the colorado river must sign off on an agreement before the threatened reductions on wednesday can be called off mr raley said he was on hand to be available in the event that things break loose but he added that time was running short especially since any agreement will require a host of legal documents to be reviewed the clock is ticking he said and as voluminous as these documents are at some point it becomes impossible to get them done by 11 59 and reviewed by everybody in another indication of movement in the negotiations the agricultural water agency in the imperial valley which voted against an agreement on dec 9 appeared to be reconsidering that position the board of the agency the imperial irrigation district held a public meeting tonight in el centro to discuss the possibility of a deal the board also scheduled a closed session for tuesday morning and a public meeting for the afternoon when a spokesman said a new vote may be held there are still a lot of ifs out there said the spokesman ronald e hull but everybody is cooperating and communicating and trying to make a go of it nobody has given up on the process a spokesman for the fourth water agency involved in the talks the coachella valley water district said it had also scheduled a special meeting for tuesday afternoon the spokesman jack porrelli said the district 's board was prepared to vote on a last minute deal but it is still unclear he said whether the meeting will be necessary i would like to tell you that everybody is on the same page right now but i do n't know that that is the case mr porrelli said under the agreement being discussed the imperial district must sell 200000 acre feet of water to the san diego county water authority the water transfer is one piece of a much larger seven state agreement negotiated over the last decade on dividing the colorado river flows and reducing california 's dependence on the river but since the vote on dec 9 the imperial district 's piece has become the most difficult to put in place gale a norton the secretary of the interior described the proposed water transfer between the imperial valley and san diego as the linchpin of a voluntary plan intended to reduce california 's draw on the colorado river over 15 years to 44 million acre feet of water a year from its current 52 million acre feet the difference is enough to supply about 16 million households the state is legally entitled to only 44 million acre feet but has long drawn much more for many years that did not matter because there was plenty of water to go around but now other fast growing states like arizona and nevada have demanded that california keep within its allotment at a water conference in las vegas this month ms norton said california would be held to the limit of 44 million acre feet whether or not the imperial district went along with the voluntary reduction plan without an agreement she said the surplus supplies will be cut off immediately with the 15 year transition period eliminated and a hard landing for the state resulting officials in the imperial valley said they were not necessarily opposed to selling water to san diego but they worried about the long term implications for farming in the valley and about the environmental consequences for the nearby salton sea with the water transfer studies have shown the sea would suffer because runoff of water from farms would be reduced that would require a multimillion dollar restoration effort that the imperial district says it can not afford mr hull the imperial district spokesman said negotiations over the past few days had focused in part on finding creative ways to pay for the restoration at the imperial board 's meeting in el centro tonight a district lawyer outlined some new environmental proposals that would be part of a prospective deal but one board member andy horne said that while many of the proposed changes looked good he worried that they were too much to digest in so short a time i have a distinct disinclination he said to approve something that i have n't read myself
