ronald d rotunda a law professor at the university of illinois was an ethics adviser to kenneth starr the other day he made an extraordinary attack on federal judges in washington writing on the op ed page of the wall street journal he said judges appointed by president clinton had dealt improperly politically with cases important to him the headline was another clinton victim the integrity of the federal courts professor rotunda 's main target was us district judge james robertson i know judge robertson and i know his high reputation for integrity so i decided to look into professor rotunda 's charges i found that they were a farrago of untruths judge robertson handled the 1998 tax fraud prosecution of webster hubbell and three others by the independent counsel professor rotunda charged that the judge had acted improperly to delay and prevent a trial of the case the defendants were arraigned on may 8 1998 their lawyers said they would file motions challenging the legal basis of the prosecution judge robertson allowed them just three weeks to do so david barger an assistant to mr starr asked the court to set an early trial date judge robertson said he would consider that at a status conference on june 2 four days after the motions were due at that conference mr barger suggested a trial date around oct 5 judge robertson said oct 5 is your date no unbiased person could read that transcript and think that the judge set out to delay or prevent a trial in fact he set an unusually tight schedule for a case involving four defendants and complex documentary evidence and the schedule was satisfactory to the independent counsel a month after the motions were filed judge robertson dismissed the prosecution on the ground among others that the fifth amendment barred the use against mr hubbell of business records he had been forced to produce the court of appeals reversed that decision but imposed tough requirements on the prosecution to prove that its evidence was constitutionally untainted in the end mr starr accepted a plea of guilty to a misdemeanor tax offense with mr hubbell paying a 25 fee then professor rotunda brought up what he called another eyebrow raiser clinton appointees to the dc district court he said held monthly caucuses from which other federal judges were excluded the implication was that they plotted here again the truth is otherwise the newer judges had lunch together half a dozen times over the years they were not caucuses they did not occur monthly and no court business was discussed somehow professor rotunda failed to mention that the charge of improper meetings had been examined by the acting chief judge of the court of appeals stephen f williams a reagan appointee and dismissed last november as frivolous reasonable observers do not take so cynical a view of the judiciary judge williams wrote judge williams also dismissed another charge repeated by professor rotunda that the chief judge of the district court norma holloway johnson had improperly taken the hubbell case and others out of the random assignment system and given them to judges appointed by president clinton the court 's rules permitted such special assignments for difficult cases and judge williams noted that the judges who got those cases had less crowded dockets judge williams is now looking at the assignment issue again after a congressman requested a further examination but whatever he does can not affect another rotunda falsehood professor rotunda wrote that the rule allowing non random assignment of difficult cases in washington had been changed last month in a stunning rebuke to chief judge johnson there was no rebuke the dc court simply changed its rules to conform with a resolution adopted a year ago by the judicial conference of the united states the court 's new rule was proposed by another judge whom professor rotunda attacked paul l friedman why would a law professor engage in the cowardly business of making false political charges against judges i can only assume that in working for kenneth starr professor rotunda was infected by the right 's hatred of president clinton and its frustration that not even a majority of the senate voted to remove him from office and why would the editors of the wall street journal publish such stuff hate again must be the answer
