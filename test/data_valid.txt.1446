the football sits in his locker wrapped with a piece of tape on it is inscribed the time of day the quarter the date and the name wayne chrebet it is his 500th career reception but instead of being a glorious treasure it has become perhaps the most ignominious symbol of his jets career when chrebet was asked today what he had done with the ball he said i ai n't got it well he does have it and if he would just as soon forget about it at least for now while the memory of his gaffe is fresh there is good reason chrebet snared the ball with fewer than 80 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter in a game against the chicago bears last sunday with the jets trailing the bears by 7 points when he latched onto the ball chrebet joined don maynard and al toon as the only jets with 500 catches but chrebet soon coughed up the ball in attempting to hurdle several bears as he sailed atop the pile the ball came loose the lost fumble was only the third of chrebet 's career which began in 1995 the bears roosevelt williams pounced on it and the jets soon fell to 7 7 setting up yet another must win game when they go to new england to play the patriots on sunday night in the ecstasy after the fumble recovery williams spiked the ball instead of being handed to chrebet as a memento of his 500th reception the ball rolled over to the bears sideline it languished untouched as a new ball was put into play the jets equipment manager clay hampton recalled today that he knew that it was chrebet 's 500th reception and he dispatched someone to retrieve the ball football players more than most athletes are able to keep the ball they use for significant plays in their careers coach herman edwards for example has the ball from his first interception as an eagles rookie it was against joe namath a milestone ball is usually within easy reach after an interception a touchdown a significant run a field goal but this time the ball was in the hands of the other team i was standing on one end of the jets sideline kenico hines a jets equipment assistant recalled today usually when players score a touchdown or something important i get the ball and mark it i did it for curtis martin against the broncos for his 10000th rushing yard hampton knew that hines had once worked for the bears and he told hines to get the ball when the game was over the ball boys on our side spotted it across the field hines said i knew some of the bears equipment people from two years ago when i was an intern there and trying to get my foot into the door when the game ended hines dashed across the field got the ball and put it in his equipment bag then i put some tape on it and marked the ball with a sharpie he said when the jets arrived back at their practice complex sunday night chrebet asked hines if he knew where the ball was i told him i had it hines said i took it out of my bag and set it in his locker it 's still there extra points the jets have no interest in reacquiring defensive tackle steve martin coach herman edwards said in a strange set of circumstances martin was suddenly cut by the patriots on thursday the day after he complained to reporters covering the jets about how little the patriots were using him he also called his former jets teammate kevin mawae a dirty player martin was a starter earlier this season for new england he wound up talking to reporters from new york only because patriots quarterback tom brady was unavailable for the weekly pregame interview the patriots must still pay martin 's salary for the last two games the nassau county police said they were continuing to investigate the charge by a limousine driver donald matinsky that a jets player pushed him to the ground and broke his kneecap almost two weeks ago outside a long island restaurant offensive tackle jumbo elliott is at the center of the inquiry according to a person with knowledge of the investigation frank laine a lawyer for matinsky said friday we 're cooperating 100 percent with the police investigation and i ca n't say the same for the jets the jets general manager terry bradway could not be reached for comment
