in a rare show of bipartisan unity senator orrin hatch a republican who is chairman of the senate judiciary committee and senator patrick leahy the committee 's ranking democrat have introduced a measure to increase the salaries of federal judges this is clearly the right step yet even with the backing of president bush the proposed 169 percent increase may prove a hard sell given these economic hard times the increase is warranted to make up for the erosion in judicial pay caused by inflation and congress 's repeated withholding of cost of living adjustments that are supposed to be routine a report in january by the national commission on the public service a study group led by paul volcker the former chairman of the federal reserve said that the purchasing power of federal judicial salaries had dropped 24 percent since 1969 it said the decline was arguably inconsistent with the constitutional provision that judicial salaries may not be reduced by congress a year ago the supreme court declined to accept a case raising that issue but it should not take a lawsuit to persuade members of congress to treat the judiciary fairly the government can not match the salaries offered by big time law firms but to recruit and retain quality judges and for the sake of fairness congress needs to provide salaries that bear a reasonable relationship to other professional opportunities as part of the package judges should be required to forgo privately financed junkets that cast an ethical cloud on the courts as senator leahy has previously proposed these are matters that transcend the ongoing partisan battle over president bush 's hard right judicial nominees
