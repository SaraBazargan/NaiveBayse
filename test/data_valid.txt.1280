i gave birth to one child in england and three more in the united states and when friends ask me about my overseas birthing experience i tell them i was lucky to be in london the first time around i am not referring to medical expertise i am talking about attitudes toward pregnancy and the much needed help mothers get after their babies are born of course there are exceptions but i found british doctors nurses and expectant mothers a lot more relaxed about pregnancy than americans in england for instance my doctor condoned my daily glass of wine back then i was shocked when i returned to the united states for a visit and my pregnant friends had what to eat and what to avoid lists if worrying had any effect on the growing fetus i figured at least my nine months were carefree maybe i was rationalizing my daily ice cream binges and my 15 pound weight gain in the first trimester during my most recent pregnancy about two years ago in new york other expectant mothers still eyed my glass of wine disapprovingly the best part of having babies british style was the aftercare every woman who gives birth in britain rich or poor gets a house call by a midwife every day for at least 10 days the midwives check on the mother 's recuperation and monitor the baby 's development i must admit when i first heard about the home care system i cringed i imagined a snippy old english nanny in a starched uniform telling me exactly how i should nurse my newborn and setting sleeping schedules with military precision but it was n't like that at all the midwives were young earthy women who would sit with me have a cup of tea and provide reassurance the intention is not to take over the care of the baby from the woman but to support her caring for her own baby melanie every a midwife and the royal college of midwives regional manager for the south of england told me recently the visiting midwife program is financed by britain 's national health service if midwives detect a medical problem in the baby or the mother they can channel the woman into proper medical care they are also on call 24 hours a day every day there are no statistics to prove that house calls by midwives save lives there have not been any studies but it seems logical that if a mother is not feeding her baby well or does not know how to nurse a newborn a midwife can offer help before the problem worsens into a life threatening condition my midwife checked to make sure my uterus was going back to its normal size and my stitches were healing properly she ensured that breast feeding was going well and that i was taking care of myself she also checked my baby 's weight every day and made sure he was urinating and moving his bowels normally weighing the baby during home visits was the most amusing part of all the english not ones to buy into modern technology quickly still used a century old technique for weighing a newborn the scales look like the cloths that hang from the legendary stork 's mouth they are actually old fashioned fishmongers scales the royal college of midwives is considering going digital but has n't yet besides the medical checks the best part for me and most mothers i spoke with is the emotional support these visitors provide they answer all sorts of questions even seemingly silly ones about where to shop for newborn clothes i was discharged from the service after 10 days because my baby and i were doing well six weeks later a community health visitor came to call with a psychological test about postpartum depression again i was skeptical about the government 's prying into my private life and again i wound up feeling grateful for the visit my visitor and i sat on the floor and discussed my feelings about motherhood and how i was coping just knowing that someone recognized the enormous changes in my life boosted my spirits contrast all this to my next pregnancy in new york city i gave birth to twins was discharged within 48 hours and sent home to fend for myself sure i was an experienced mother but i really missed my english midwives i missed my afternoon teas my dollop of emotional reassurance much much needed in those first few days best of all was that in england where i was the foreigner i felt connected to a community one that cared for its new babies and new mothers
