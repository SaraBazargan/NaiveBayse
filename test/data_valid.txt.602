racing universe in one month in each of the first two legs of the triple crown war emblem answered a new question in louisville ky the question was simply who is he yesterday with so much talk about ganging up the question was did he have the versatility before winning the derby war emblem 's chief claim to fame was being purchased just weeks before now the racing community will have to look at

he recalls the smells the sights and the sounds of each triple crown victory the memories have sustained him winning the triple crown was the greatest moment of my life he said friday i was young and fearless but also very aware of what it all meant and how difficult something like that was to achieve each triple crown race requires an adjustment the adjustment alydar 's stable made between the derby and the preakness was adding more speed work to alydar 's regimen they wanted him to find his legs quicker wanted him to get into the race quicker so they gave him a lot of speed work cauthen recalled the result was a faster quicker alydar in the preakness but not fast enough not quick enough to beat affirmed who thrived in the fast track race as much as the qualities needed to win the triple crown are draped in mystery affirmed had the one quality that is consistent with all great champions versatility he had the ability to focus in the wild free for all race at the derby he had

pressure cauthen began to feel the pressure after he won the preakness and the reality of winning a triple crown took hold of his mind the belmont is more than the final jewel in the crown the next
