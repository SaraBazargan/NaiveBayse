the custom of the country demands that you belch after meals a traveler to egypt writes i do it badly well it 's good to know your guide is n't coarse and it helps if he has a flair for the mot juste in 1849 seven years before madame bovary appeared gustave flaubert set off on a trip to the middle east he slept on a boat on the nile sat cross legged to discuss religion with a coptic bishop and spent a night with a famous courtesan named kuchuk hanem she sent a messenger escorted by a tame sheep all spotted with yellow henna that followed her like a dog he kept track of all this in a travel diary and many droll preening letters home now filled with exquisitely useless information flaubert 's uselessness as a guide is precisely what makes his travel memoirs more appealing than ever right now when even fearless travelers may hesitate before jumping on a plane it 's not the threat of terror as much as the specter of discomfort that keeps us home as news reports show long waits at airports and friends share tales of having nail scissors confiscated before boarding no wonder some people are curling up on a couch and sending a telepathic message to the security experts call me when you 've got the bugs worked out travel books may seem like a cozy substitute but that depends on the kind of armchair voyager you are for some people travel writing is a replacement for the actual event they regard travelogues the way i look at cookbooks as a form of science fiction but for some of us the vicarious pleasure of travelogues is attached to the fantasy however far fetched of going there someday from that perspective if travel itself is temporarily put on a shelf travel books belong there too why taunt yourself reading about a place you 'll wistful martyred sigh here probably never see i found the perfect alternative by accident when i spotted peter ackroyd 's thick anecdotal history london the biography while browsing in a store the thought of struggling to kennedy and landing at heathrow may have been too much but landing in london in the 17th or 18th century suddenly seemed irresistible you ca n't feel bad about not being in a place that does n't exist anymore armchair time travel was the answer a vicarious journey with no regrets ackroyd 's book will not remind you of all the west end plays you 're not seeing his version of an entertainment guide is a litany of lost amusements in a place where performers balanced on the weathercock of st paul 's steeple there were midnight dog shows and duels of rats performing bears and performing monkeys dragged through the streets of london upon long ropes still history did n't quite satisfy the urge to escape there was too much of the present in ackroyd 's perspective and contemporary voice it is after all the travel writer 's voice that matters even more than his information and a voice speaking directly from the past offered the truest escape to another time as well as place that is how i came to flaubert whose travel writings i had never gotten around to scattered in many places and editions they are also collected in a lovely small volume flaubert in egypt translated and edited by francis steegmuller his unexpectedly witty reminiscences sent me hopscotching through other writers work each with something to add to the idea of armchair time travel in his book travels through france and italy tobias smollett keeps his promise the best a guide can make that i shall not trouble you with a repetition of trite observations instead with his 18th century novelist 's eye he describes real life details that would be pure kitsch if reproduced today in 1765 he says you could buy wine from a window at any nobleman 's house in florence in every palace or great house in this city there is a little window fronting the street provided with an iron knocker and over it hangs an empty flask by way of sign post when novelists turn to travel they often share such local customs like flaubert 's belch that might help a traveler fit in charles dickens in american notes his book about a lecture tour of the united states records how bemused he was by the exotica of washington dc which in 1842 he found to be the tobacco spittingest place on earth he gives its role as the head quarters of tobacco tinctured saliva two fat paragraphs and if you travel long enough in the past eventually you come to countries that no longer exist the ultimate impossible voyage sri lanka is a place on the map but the ceylon it used to be is a place in time monday december 23 1895 sailed from sydney for ceylon mark twain begins in following the equator the book that charts his 13 month journey around the world on the ship oceana he describes the crew wearing white cotton petticoat and pants barefoot red shawl for belt straw cap and after he arrives in ceylon clothes figure even more pertinently among the beautiful flowing scarves and robes he spots ceylonese girls from a christian missionary school who have been clothed in european uniforms i looked at my womenfolk 's clothes and was ashamed to be seen in the street with them he writes then i looked at my own clothes and was ashamed to be seen in the street with myself by the time i got to twain it was becoming clear there could be no pure escape call it ceylon or sri lanka he was talking about cultural imperialism an issue that has hardly been left in the dust but it was henry james who hinted that the discomfort of travel has only changed in the details in his essay london in the dead season he writes of remaining unfashionably in the city in the summer of 1878 settling into his club with a newspaper he reads the complaints of english travelers who are taking a holiday upon the continent the usual complaints of leaking lamps in railway carriages and of the heavy boots worn at night in the corridors of swiss hotels well leaking lamps do n't sound much better than long check in lines at the airport and it was henry james who finally linked journeys to the past with traveling today in a line that makes as much sense now as it did in 1881 leaving italy is always a heartbreak but this time i bled more profusely than ever he writes from his home in london to a friend who has been his hostess in venice if italy looks lovely to you from the grand canal you may fancy how it looks to me from piccadilly there is wistfulness that is deserved and that 's when i realized that while armchair time travel has its comforting role it can also make you imagine the possible and head for the door
