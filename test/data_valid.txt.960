the risk of on the ground collisions between airplanes is growing because of a jump in airport traffic and a computer system designed to prevent planes from blundering onto the wrong runway now 10 years behind schedule will not be good enough the national transportation safety board said today concluding a study of such runway intrusions the safety board recommended that the federal aviation administration stop relying so much on high technology solutions and focus more on changing tower controllers procedures even though that could increase airport delays the number of cases in which a plane or other vehicle intrudes on an active runway rose 27 percent to 150 from 118 during the first five months of this year from the corresponding period in 1999 the safety board asked for improvements in runway safety nine years ago after an eastern airlines 727 landed in atlanta behind a small plane and hit it killing its pilot the faa replied then that its new computer system due the following year would solve the problem but the chairman of the safety board james e hall pointed out today that since that crash there had been five more fatal collisions on the ground killing 62 people and that the new system is still not operational in any airport instead it is now due to be installed at 34 airports in 2002 further the board noted the aviation agency has scaled back its goals for the system the system as envisioned in 1991 would have watched planes on taxiways and runways but the faa simplified it to look only at runways this sharply reduces the warning time it can give if a plane moves off a taxiway onto an active runway safety board officials said in response to the board 's report john mayrhofer who heads the aviation agency 's runway safety program said that developing the system had proved far more difficult than anticipated there are 382 airports around the country with scheduled service although not all have control towers about three dozen of the biggest airports have radar systems that track planes as well as trucks and other vehicles on the ground attached to the ground radar the new computer system would calculate when a plane was on takeoff roll or landing and give visual and aural warnings to the controller if another plane seemed ready to cross its path although the amount of time available would depend on the geometry of the intrusion the safety board said the warnings would not be quick enough to let the controller determine which blip was which radio the appropriate plane and have that plane 's crew react ground collisions are among the biggest risks for air travelers say experts who note that the world 's deadliest aviation accident was the collision of two boeing 747 's on the ground in the canary islands in 1977 that crash which killed 582 people echoed in chicago last year when an air china 747 landed at o'hare turned off onto a taxiway and then turned back onto the runway as a korean air 747 was on its takeoff roll as the startled controller yelled stop into his radio the korean plane lifted off early and crossed 25 to 50 feet over the other there were 387 people on the two planes the rise in runway intrusions in the first five months of 2000 adds to an increase of recent years the number of cases when a plane or other vehicle blundered onto an active runway was 321 in 1999 about the same as the year before but up by 71 percent from 1993 the number of incursions per 100000 takeoffs or landings is also up by 56 percent since 1993 and the faa expects that airport operations will grow by one fourth over the next 10 years which seems likely to drive the rate higher unless something is done the safety board made several recommendations to the aviation agency today among them that controllers speak more slowly especially to foreign pilots it also said that unless specifically cleared pilots should have to stop at each runway they are about to cross a procedure already used in europe currently if a controller clears a plane to taxi a runway the pilot is allowed to cross all runways in between but stopping at each runway might lead to more radio transmissions for each landing or takeoff perhaps more than a controller could handle without delaying flights some experts said there are some workload issues said bill blackmer a safety specialist at the national air traffic controllers association the controllers union the faa is already turning to some lower tech ways of trying to prevent ground collisions it has begun a campaign to educate pilots controllers and others about the risks of runway intrusions and it plans a conference here later this month for 500 people including airport officials to discuss solutions it has also been trying to improve airport signs and runway markings to help pilots find their way
