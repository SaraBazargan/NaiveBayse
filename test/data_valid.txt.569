in russia if you 're an american expatriate skating fan longing for a bit of back home camaraderie you might think you will find it at the st petersburg grand hotel lobby bar given that the international grand prix of figure skating final is in town this week be prepared to drink alone there 's only one american skater competing in this championship and precious few fellow travelers to get an invitation to the grand prix final you have to earn it and it 's a troubling indication of the depth in american skating or lack thereof that out of a possible 24 slots only one will be represented by a skater from the united states who will dominate the event skaters from the country that has ruled the sport for decades russia the grand prix final is the culmination of the grand prix series which consists of six international events the top six point scoring athletes in each of the women 's men 's pairs and ice dancing events are eligible to compete in the grand prix final running friday through march 3 two american skaters did make it into the event the rising star sasha cohen who is coincidentally half russian and the venerable michelle kwan hot off her seventh national title but kwan withdrew citing a desire to use the few remaining weeks in the season to hone her programs for next month 's world championships over the eight year history of the grand prix the united states has been strongly represented only by the women with three gold medals american women tie the russians in women 's singles in the grand prix final in the other divisions the american team is on thin ice particularly in men 's and pairs at this year 's nationals not a single man could land a decent quadruple jump the men 's and pairs events were major splatfests in which the combatants left the ice occasionally bloodied and presumably worse embarrassed there was bad karma all around a top men 's coach don laws said of the laughably inept display things happened that could n't be accounted for my thought was that we did n't need judges at nationals we needed an exorcist michael weiss who won his third national men 's title says he has put his subpar performance behind him like the rest of the american men weiss did not make it into the grand prix final and has instead focused his sights on the world championships the russians are unknown so they are exotic weiss said people tend to put them on a pedestal he insists that he is undaunted by the challenge they present i 've pretty much beat most of these skaters at one point or another in my career i hear people say the russians are unbeatable well in sports no one is invincible but in the overall grand prix medal count the scales tip decidedly in favor of the russians they have won an impressive 37 medals to a relatively paltry 14 for the americans russian men have taken the singles gold six times american men zero gold medals for the americans in ice dancing and pairs zero again in world championship competition american pairs have not won a gold medal in 24 years hardly what you would call a hot streak one of the reasons for the huge imbalance is that the united states simply does not have enough good male skaters to fill the ranks there is a disproportionate ratio of girls to boys in american figure skating what the former soviets find curious is the reluctance of american boys to enter the sport in russia and europe there is no stigma attached to figure skating it is a masculine sport and the mind set is completely different said the coach and former champion ice dancer aleksander zhulin who has set up a training program in new jersey after the breakup of the soviet union many top coaches packed up and left to find work and better living conditions in the west their students followed now they have created substantial training groups in the united states and along with their countrymen back home they continue to produce the finest skaters zhulin 's prize student aleksander abt recently won the russian championship and is one of the top competitors in the grand prix final abt left moscow over a year ago and he has enjoyed his greatest competitive success for russia while living in america watch abt from a dead stop on the ice said morry stillwell former president of the united states figure skating association in two strokes he 's flat out at top speed he has the best acceleration unquestionably of any skater but the reigning olympic and four time world champion aleksei yagudin is the undisputed star of the sport yagudin trains in simsbury conn and almost all of his major victories came after his arrival in 1998 at 18 what coaxed yagudin into the trans atlantic leap was the opportunity to train with the legendary coach tatyana tarasova she fine tuned his skills and artistry making him virtually unbeatable when he is in top form this season he was forced to withdraw from the grand prix series unable to defend his title because of injury how good is yagudin the united states figure skating association the governing national organization paid him 275000 in appearance fees for three events this season why would they shell out that kind of money to a foreign skater because yagudin fills the seats our training system is a combination of hard off ice and on ice discipline work and dedication yagudin said explaining why russia has been on top for so many years we always try to incorporate new elements and increase the level of difficulty personally whether it is during practices competitions or shows i strive for perfection america has no true male figure skating star certainly not one with the draw talent and charisma of yagudin and stillwell is not convinced that the american men 's team will fare any better next season i do n't see a deep field coming up from the junior ranks he said we 're not very strong right now we could be in for a long dry spell zhulin has his own insight into russia 's skating success they do not simply train he said of all skaters even the children back home they compete with each other like bullfighters under the government system it is talent that is rewarded if you have talent you get to continue and move up if not you 're out money does not buy your security in the sport like it can in america because nobody in russia has any talent is the great equalizer and because of it the ice arena becomes a bullring and the young skaters fight to survive kathleen bangs a former airline pilot is writing a book starflyers celebrities take to the skies
