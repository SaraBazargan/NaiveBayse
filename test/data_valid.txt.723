despite players views to the contrary baseball 's club owners acted today on their conviction that linking the outcome of the all star game to home field advantage in the world series would rejuvenate the all star game the owners voted 30 0 to implement the linkage beginning with this season 's game on july 15 at comiskey park in chicago if they can persuade the players to approve the plan the pennant winner whose league wins the all star game will be at home for games 1 2 6 and 7 of the world series in october but the owners do n't know if they can persuade the players to join them in what they see as an attempt according to commissioner bud selig to energize the game we understand this needs the approval of the players association selig said after the owners meeting and hopefully that will come very expeditiously but based on the views that players have expressed publicly and privately approval is not likely to come at all let alone expeditiously we appreciate what they 're trying to do what their objective is gene orza the union 's no 2 official said by telephone from new york we 'll talk to more players than we have already about it it 's clear there are a number of players who have questions about it by the same token there are a lot of players we 'll begin discussions with them pretty soon orza seemed to be trying to sound as positive as possible in a situation that offered little hope for a positive development most likely the only way the players will give their approval is if they believe the change is in the best interests of future television revenue the fox network which televises baseball has pushed for the change in an effort to improve all star game ratings which have declined in recent years selig went forward with the vote even though union officials had apprised him of the negative reaction of the many players whom they had talked to this is an issue we have debated for eight or nine months selig said this is the fans game this is something we 're talking about in marketing our sport the executive council voted on this some time ago the clubs are n't going to meet again until may so this was the time selig the owners and fox believe that by making the outcome of the all star game more meaningful players and fans will take a greater interest in it until now the world series has alternated starting sites and thus the home field advantage on a yearly basis with the national league team getting game 1 one year and the american league the next players generally feel that home field advantage is too important to be decided by a game that does n't count in the standings some owners said today that the problem with the all star game is that it has become an exhibition game meaning the players no longer play hard but the all star game has always been an exhibition game when it was suggested to selig that many players in the all star game would have no incentive to win it because their teams would not be in position to get to the world series selig said that is a bogus argument all star team players and managers are from teams in playoff contention bob daly managing partner of the los angeles dodgers said once something is at stake it brings out a different element of their play rather than everyone hugging each other and giving high fives fox and the fans pay a lot of money for the all star game selig said they deserve to see the same intensity they see all year long he added for many years it was not a meaningless exhibition game selig also plans to have the managers run the all star teams differently instructing them to play the elected starters longer and holding some pitchers back to make sure they do n't run out of pitchers as joe torre and bob brenly did last season forcing selig to end the game in a 7 7 tie in other developments sandy alderson head of baseball operations said the goal next season will be to reduce the average time of games from 2 hours 52 minutes last season to 2 45 and he added that bat boys and bat girls will have to be at least 14 years old a decision stemming from a near accident that dusty baker 's 3 1 2 year old son had in the world series last october selig announced the appointment of a 17 person task force to shape the future development of major league baseball among the members are daly tom werner chairman of the boston red sox al rosen former player and executive leonard coleman former national league president tom glavine and david cone television executives and college professors we 're going to look at everything on the field and off the field selig said selig did not have much to say about pete rose whose ineligible status he is reviewing selig had been scheduled to meet with members of the hall of fame on friday in los angeles but asked that the meeting be postponed i asked them to put it off for a little while he said
