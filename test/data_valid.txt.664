city council speaker peter f vallone charged yesterday that the parks department 's requests for donations from nonprofit groups that use the city 's parks are heavyhanded and possibly illegal he also threatened to subpoena financial records of the department to determine how much had been raised through such donations and how the money had been spent mr vallone said the council would also seek out nonprofit groups that have used city parks for events to determine whether they had been pressured into making donations the charges came yesterday amid a standoff between mr vallone and henry j stern the parks commissioner over what several officials have called a longstanding policy of raising money for park improvements from a variety of groups that use the parks for concerts festivals and fund raisers the dispute erupted on wednesday when the organizers of the new national museum of catholic art and history said that mr stern 's staff had demanded 20000 in exchange for its use of an east harlem park for a fund raiser on tuesday mr stern said to reporters at city hall yesterday that such requests had been commonplace for more than a decade and were necessary to supplement the parks department 's budget he said the policy was legal in an interview mr stern said that money raised from the donations was deposited with the city parks foundation a philanthropy to pay for park maintenance and improvements like the conservancies which are controlled by outside directors the city parks foundation receives most of its support from corporations philanthropies and voluntary contributions but decisions over how the foundation 's funds are spent are affected by how they are raised mr stern said while the foundation 's board of directors exercises the most control he said the parks department dictates how the money it raises through its own donations is spent this is a perfectly honorable way for institutions to raise funds mr stern said the dispute with the museum fund raisers appeared to be resolved yesterday after mr stern 's staff said that someone whom they refused to identify had donated 20000 on behalf of the group mr vallone said yesterday that the parks department 's policy left open the suspicion of corruption he said the city council 's finance committee would review the parks department 's records on how the donations had been spent he said he would use the council 's power of subpoena if the department resists mr stern said he would try to provide the financial accounting sought by mr vallone and would do so without a subpoena but he said that the parks department 's records did not provide a clear breakdown of how much of the city parks foundation 's money had come from outside contributions and from parks department donations like the one for the catholic museum event
