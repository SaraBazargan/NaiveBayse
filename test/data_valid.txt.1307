goes more easily when you invite people to share something sweet that 's the cheery premise of the little house of cookies the latest production by tada a theater group made up largely of children although the show is a revival from 1984 it 's the first musical tada ever produced the recipe is still delicious adapted by janine nina trevens from eleanor clymer 's book the tiny little house the play explores themes of friendship and community with a little magic thrown in the heroine is alice a fifth grader and the neighborhood pariah no one wants to play with her but alice and the other children who range from basketball enthusiasts to an aspiring rock group that calls itself the beagles share an intense curiosity about a tiny house wedged among the high rises on their block this is new york circa 1967 though the house is unoccupied and often left unlocked no one can enter the door mysteriously shrinks when anyone tries it that changes when alice and jane a new girl she befriends decide to venture inside they spruce up the house and invite in mrs o'brien a local eccentric who like alice is misunderstood with some delicious cookies from mrs o'brien 's basket they soon transform the house into a bake shop that attracts all of alice 's former detractors that is until the landlord finds out but you can guess the way to this man 's heart with a jazzy score and lyrics by joel
