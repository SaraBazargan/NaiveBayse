sasha waltz a 39 year old german choreographer based in berlin has said in numerous interviews that it is misleading to compare her to pina bausch not to worry ms waltz is definitely not on ms bausch 's genius level of creativity ingenuity is more her style and there is a brilliant exploration of movement at the start of her korper bodies the latest entry in the next wave festival at the brooklyn academy of music nothing tops the sight here of bodies dropping to the floor with a startling thud but by the end of the performance on wednesday night at the academy 's gilman opera house korper had run out of steam its images were often clever purporting to tell us something about how the human body is regarded treated violated and analyzed but text and visual trappings centered around a huge blackboard wall with an occasionally blocked out window told us little new the movement was the thing and here ms waltz is right in tracing her formative influences to the time she spent in new york and rotterdam among postmodern choreographers rather than to the german dance theater genre with which ms bausch became identified after the 1970 's even in 1995 when ms waltz 's former troupe sasha waltz and guests presented her travelogue 20 to 8 at la mama in new york traces of dance theater were more than balanced by passages of pure movement in the 1980 's ms waltz performed with experimental new york choreographers including pooh kaye yoshiko chuma and lisa kraus the idea in korper that bodies can be regarded as animate objects and that objects can look animated has some roots in this stage of ms waltz 's career certainly her use of highly physical partnering is an adaptation of release technique as used by trisha brown and others nonetheless there is more control than release in ms waltz 's choreography her company is now part of the celebrated experimental theater schaubuhne am lehniner platz in berlin the dancers hailing from several countries do not all perform on the same level of execution the visible mechanics of the movement sometimes destroy the impact of the intended image similarly the jokes about body surface and functions are ambiguously presented we see the bottles of water that attendants use to simulate fluids emanating from various parts of other dancers bodies but the double layer of an illusion and the mechanics behind it does not come off when a man is picked up by the skin of his rear end the means of support to do so are not completely hidden when red yarn is pulled out of a man 's abdomen the moment does not have the same impact as when kathakali dancers from india draw these guts from a foe in kathakali that impact comes from an emotional expression built up detail by detail there is little to move one in korper and that may be deliberate the male and female dancers are often topless and in underpants but their flesh to flesh encounters are never erotic a slow moving jumble of bodies pressed against the pane in the middle of the blackboard is just that in a dance work where the body is object this kind of image is still another clinical exploration of how the body can be manipulated on the other hand when two women plant dollar signs on each other the reference to traffic in body parts is vividly resonant wittier passages have a dancer describing one part of the body while pointing to another as the ensemble points to the correct part the highlight of the performance is the first dead drop trio with its drop dead connotations during a prologue a couple edge along the big blackboard and body parts are defined a leg hands an arm appear from a hole in the wall when the house lights dim three dancers begin an extraordinary sequence of flips and falls around one another 's bodies they hold their torsos and arms stiff as they drop on their backs and their sides upright bodies land with a thud as two flat feet hit the ground there is a duet with a hammerlock embrace and it is not uncommon for a woman 's neck to be pushed by a man 's instep here is the body used with both frightening and glorious physicality the following images are presumably intended to have a cumulative effect especially after the wall falls forward narrowly missing two dancers the sequences include the bas relief of bodies in the window dancers speaking of experiences two dancers forming one body legs backward a man on skis descending the board at right angles a man pointing a fishing rod like a rifle from a loge in the theater a man stuffing his shirt with the insides of a stuffed toy and a woman manipulating cobweb veils on sticks none of this adds up and it is probably not supposed to ms waltz is better at the isolated image like the final one of a man and woman pane between them excited by a virtual romance
