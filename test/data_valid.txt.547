in the last year an imprinting of sorts has been taking place on the unconscious of rock musicians suddenly dozens of bands most unconnected to the others have released new albums around the same time to try to save rock 'n roll from its current doldrums with raw energy and influences from the 60 's and 70 's particularly the british invasion garage rock and early punk rock fans have mostly been hearing about two american bands the strokes and the white stripes as the music 's saviors but there are many others including the faint the vue the moldy peaches the black rebel motorcycle club and from sweden the hives and the politically minded international noise conspiracy it 's like the law of physics every action has a reaction said joe shanahan who has been impressed by the performances of many of these bands at the club he owns cabaret metro in chicago the glitzy overproduced pop sound that 's bombarding our ears is obviously making someone somewhere in these great towns across america say 'if this is what we 're up against let 's turn up our amps a little louder let 's get our open chords to ring a little louder this sentiment is most directly expressed in a song by black rebel motorcycle club a trio specializing in feedback drenched rock reminiscent of spacemen 3 and jesus and mary chain in it the group sings i gave my soul to a simple chord before lamenting what ever happened to our rock 'n roll  whatever happened to my rock 'n roll the hunger for a new rock movement more accurately a new old rock movement stems perhaps from the hegemony of the nu metal scene which is an amalgamation of mostly mediocre post korn bands that dominates rock radio nearly two thirds of billboard magazine 's modern rock songs chart is accounted for by such bands one notable exception however is a single that has been creeping up the chart and is now at 17 that is last nite by the strokes a well heeled new york city group that recalls the proto punk of television the stooges and the velvet underground it has suddenly been added to commercial radio playlists around the country surrounded by hits that sound nothing like it there 's an audience ready for this mr shanahan said the rock fans are looking for the genuine article and this has got that rough edge a ragged soul that gives it authenticity these bands look like you and i the everyman there are a lot of commercial bands even on the nu metal side who are primping like they 're going off to a prom though the strokes and black rebel motorcycle club have recently put out their first albums on major labels rca and virgin most new retro rockers do n't have great pop dreams the faint whose raw sound leans more toward the dark romantics of 80 's new wave have serious offers from four major labels but a spokesman for the independent label the band records for saddle creek in omaha said it seemed unlikely that the faint would sign a major deal unless it was extremely enticing that 's the reason the white stripes a detroit duo that plays a blistering garage rock version of the blues recently signed unexpectedly with v2 records it was offered a generous deal that includes a coveted and rare clause allowing it to retain ownership of their master recordings these are the bands that are really going to be the future of rock said andy gershon the president of v2 you see them in the press they 're selling records and they 're doing a fantastic touring business the only missing link is radio and at some point radio is going to wake up and go 'omigod look what 's going on here it 's the same thing that happened in the early 90 's with grunge and with hair metal before that the scene becomes too great for anyone to ignore that 's what 's going to happen with these bands the need for this music has been so great that something strange yet typical of rock has happened there has been such excitement about the strokes and the white stripes that there has already been a reaction against them particularly with underground and alternative music fans and pundits can have a bad habit of dismissing a band simply because too many other people discovered it before they did then there 's the british press which has always been quick to spot quality american rock movements before the strokes album came out that band was already on the cover of the british music weekly nme garnering so much attention and hype that by the time its album knowingly titled is this it was released there was already a backlash and many said that they were disappointed with the album though they had nothing to compare it with except their own raised expectations this raw rock movement could go several ways in the next year already it has produced some great recording particularly white blood cells by the white stripes the modern age ep by the strokes and danse macabre by the faint but some see this as an over exposed trend saying that with the current paucity of quality rock bands that sound halfway decent are getting far too much attention others however see this as the first wave of bands in what might be the new sound of college radio with some potential to make the inroads into commercial radio that alternative rock did in the early 90 's either way the acknowledgment these acts have received has been an effective counter to a comment that comes more from laziness or nostalgia than from truth that there are no good new rock bands anymore the pop life correction december 1 2001 saturday a picture caption on thursday with the pop life column about bands that are bringing new energy to rock 'n roll referred incorrectly to a highly regarded recording by the white stripes which is in the forefront of the movement it is white blood cells not is this it and it is the group 's third album not its first is this it as the column noted is the first album by the band strokes
