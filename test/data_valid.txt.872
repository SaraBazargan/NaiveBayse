painfully shy how to overcome social anxiety and reclaim your life by barbara g markway and gregory p markway thomas dunne books st martin 's press 2395 shyness as we generally know it implies a timid reserve a quality perhaps best expressed in the term wallflower but what the authors husband and wife and clinical psychologists describe here is a far more serious affliction one that creates intense physical distress and mental anguish that are sometimes severe enough to put some people at greater risk for depression substance abuse and even suicide known formally as social phobia it is an anxiety disorder that afflicts an estimated 17 million americans its sufferers among them barbara markway herself may include the third grader who can not raise her hand in class to answer a question or participate in class discussion so withdrawn is she that she is too embarrassed to get up from her desk to sharpen a pencil put trash in a basket or even to use the restroom another case described by the authors is the young hospital resident anguishing over details related to eye contact the position of his arms and his stance the situations vary the authors write but the fears the fear of criticism the fear of scrutiny and the fear of disapproval are the same quality of life can be severely compromised the authors offer a number of approaches to regaining control and there are enough questionnaires checkoffs instructions practice lists spiritual hints relaxation techniques personal stories and medication and herbal assessments in this formulaic self help book to thrill any oprah fan there are the obligatory discussions of food and mood the hidden power of breathing rest and sleep physical exercise and advice on using medications wisely despite the familiarity of some of the advice remedies that have been applied to every anxiety known to humankind the book serves to heighten awareness of a problem that receives too little attention perhaps because it is so common whether this work like others of this genre will actually help is hard to say as the authors themselves point out if you 're dealing with social anxiety disorder in addition to another anxiety disorder recognize that self help approaches may not be enough making the case for brain training therapy a symphony in the brain the evolution of the new brain wave biofeedback by jim robbins atlantic monthly press 24 when the author of this book first heard of a technique known variously as brain wave biofeedback neurofeedback and neuro therapy he was battling chronic fatigue syndrome and had exhausted traditional therapies though it had a new age whiff about it he nonetheless traveled to a weekend symposium got his scalp hooked up to a computer display via electroencephalogram sensors and began a session of brain training after a half hour he recalls my mind was tired my thoughts muddled but an hour or so after i finished i experienced what is known as the clean windshield effect the world looked sharp and crystalline and i had a quiet energetic feeling that lasted a couple of hours it was the first time i had felt that way in years biofeedback which has been around for some 30 years harnesses the body 's natural rhythms brain waves and autonomic functions to monitors that allow one to see for example amplified electrical frequencies of the brain or usually unconscious occurrences like blood pressure and heart and lung action by watching these events on a computer screen participants are able to influence their physical and mental well being in neurofeedback patients can be trained to operate in brain frequencies they do not generally use an exercise designed to enable one to strengthen the brain mr robbins a journalist whose articles occasionally appear in the new york times focuses on the brain strengthening aspects of the technique making a decent case through interviews with clinicians researchers and patients for its value in a variety of disorders including autism epilepsy attention deficit disorder learning disabilities head injuries post traumatic stress disorder addictions and depression he argues that though the medical profession is generally dismissive of the therapy the effects of neurofeedback are not subtle but extremely robust it may not be either miracle or panacea he writes but it is science albeit science that is still young and relatively unknown the big question about neurofeedback he concludes is not whether it works but why it is as effective as it is for whom precisely and how it can be made more powerful
