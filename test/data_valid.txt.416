to the editor unsettling memories of lyndon b johnson 's mastery of the art of intimidation surfaced on reading remembering the johnson treatment by tom wicker op ed may 9 mr wicker succumbed to the same treatment that unnerved this lowly aide to senator j william fulbright during the vietnam war at the height of that war i was invited to the white house with other congressional apostates at a small table dominated by his large frame the president took my hand in his huge paws silence grew ominous as pressure from this old testament god increased reducing me to that sort of nothingness mr wicker recounts thus diminished i heard a voice that was measured soft and frightening now you just tell bill i ca n't remember the rest of his message to bill i only remember during confrontations with the president most notably the gulf of tonkin deception the weight of the oppressive silence and the staring eyes and yet to this day however diminished by the treatment my admiration for that flawed caring giant remains william b bader washington may 9 2002
