my piano lessons began 50 years ago in september 1951 my teacher was an austrian martinet isadore buchalter he told my family that he had hopes for me that i was somewhat musical but that i could n't learn to read i realized 40 plus years later that i was n't cursed with indolence but that i could n't see the notes i was hopelessly myopic i got my first eyeglasses when i was 8 but by then i had quit the piano around 1963 my lessons continued when i had the great fortune to meet louise gould she sat me down and had me playing triads and triads with the octave both hands up and down the keyboard she used this simple exercise to show me the cycle of fifths and its additions subtraction alterations inversions which are the foundations of music theory i realized that my toddler piano lessons had taught me to play without reading to fake it to play by ear i played four hands one afternoon with randy newman i apologized for rushing i said i was such a musical doofus that i almost felt as if i had to count he stopped and looked at me a bit in incomprehension and said everyone counts he also taught me to hear the passing tone to listen for it as it was driving the music joel silver produced several of my wife 's records and i got a priceless tip from him leave out the third we hear it anyway the passing tone and the excised third opened up a new world to me i began to get timorously bold to eschew the first inversion and the keys of f and c major the stoics cautioned us to keep our philosophical precepts few and simple as we might have to refer to them at a moment 's notice these tips became my philosophical principles and they forced me to slow down and think i remember bensinger 's pool hall in chicago in the 60 's and the hustler instructor who taught if you can see more do n't shoot same idea people say the great genius of nat cole was his ability to accompany himself on the piano that he understood that most delicate and intricate duet and its demand for spaciousness for elegance we hear it anyway this is the genius of bach and the overwhelming demand of dramaturgy this understanding or its lack divides those who can write from those who can really write how much can one remove and still have the composition be intelligible chekhov removed the plot pinter elaborating removed the history the narration beckett the characterization we hear it anyway it is in our nature to elaborate estimate predict to run before the event this is the meaning of consciousness anything else is instinct bach allows us to run before and his resolutions as per aristotle are as inevitable as they must be given the strictures of western compositional form and surprising as his elaborate genius we are thus delighted and instructed as per freud in a nonverbal way as to the varieties of perception possibility completion we are made better our consciousness listening to bach has been rewarded refreshed chastised soothed in bach and sophocles both the burden of consciousness has momentarily been laid down both legitimate modern drama pirandello ionesco and the trash of performance art build on the revelation that omission is a form of creation that we hear the third anyway that the audience will supply the plot but our experience of such can be at best a smug joy we listen to some concert pianist improvise waterfall arpeggios for an hour or view puerile performances and though we may leave the theater smiling we are left poorer for we celebrated not the divine but the ability of the uninspired to ape the divine this is idolatry we rejoice both in the familiar and the surprising music drama circus the creation of all the performing arts proceeds from researched or intuited understanding of the nature of human perception thesis antithesis synthesis i can fly from one trapeze to another but can i do a triple somersault yes no yes much modern art is either a slavish reiteration of the form musical comedy its slavish rejection action painting yes it is true that life would be better if we were all a little kinder and it is true that paint spattered in the air will fall to the ground both are true but who would have suspected that they were notable the commandments are the same leave out the third concentrate on the missing tone yes we know that in the key of g a c chord would like to resolve to g how does it get there the ardor to address this question accounts for the genius of beckett and also of vernon duke prokofiev kurt weill the fascinating question of art what is between a and b writers on writing articles in this series are presenting writers exploration of literary themes previous contributions nytimescom books columns
