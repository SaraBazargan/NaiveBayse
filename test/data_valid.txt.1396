juba robert battle 's first work for the alvin ailey american dance theater is frenetic and electrifying a terse powerful explosion of transformative energy on the surface nothing seemed to be happening as three men and a woman jumped up and down virtually nonstop while regrouping into various patterns when juba had its premiere on wednesday night at city center yet by the end an infernal communal round had found spiritual release through some sort of centrifugal force filled with fabulously high octane stamina by the ailey dancers juba should not be mistaken for a minimalist piece mr battle a 31 year old choreographer and former member of david parsons 's company has hit upon an abstract signature style that is highly dramatic in juba as in other recent pieces for his own troupe battleworks and other groups the focus is on repetitive stamping steps and bodies set aquiver everything seems to be sustained in tone including john mackey 's commissioned and apt jagged score for electronic string quartet and percussion but mr battle and this is his originality matches this apparent evenness of tone with a sense of climax the steps are similar and repeated but there is also mounting energy it is an ingenious paradox found also in old ecstatic dances mr battle has given different signals about juba in various statements although the title has been associated with 19th century black music hall dancers he refers to it as a name for a west african dance and as a metaphor for black survival a second explanation is more relevant to the work onstage mr battle speaks of people 's everlasting need to move to dance to reach a higher place through folk dance the ruling image in juba is in fact a mini balkan chain dance for four dancers in mia mcswain 's stylish neo slavic costumes hope boykin matthew rushing abdur rahim jackson and samuel deshauteurs lose no time in joining hands for this high stepping and stamping dance that absorbs other folk touches georgian fists to the chest nonetheless this is a neo folk dance and mr battle is no mere circles and lines choreographer mr rushing reels off and the music 's chugging rhythms and melody give way to a wail as all shake their shoulders gypsy style mr deshauteurs beats his fists on the others thighs the men clasp their hands behind their backs in simulated bondage and ms boykin takes over with matriarchal fervor her pelvis forward strut and terrific power moving her front and center all look up and reel back and erupt into a rapid fire heel and toe dance salvation via the universal urge to dance ronald k brown 's grace reaches the promised land through a very different and fluid dynamic opening the program it was as usual a dazzling and deep work
