to the editor re the ashcroft message editorial feb 2 so the democratic senators sent a message to president bush not to nominate any extreme right wingers they 'll accept john ashcroft because he 's a former colleague they 'll extend senatorial courtesy because the new president deserves latitude in picking his cabinet that 's certainly one spin on the situation but from another perspective it looks like cowardly appeasement just after an election in which the democrats picked up seats in the house and the senate when mr ashcroft was defeated in his home state when the presidency itself was determined by judicial coronation rather than by the vote of the people in the face of all this the absence of a democratic filibuster is unconscionable would the republicans have extended any latitude or courtesy if a president gore had nominated barney frank or jesse jackson as attorney general charles cutter appomattox va feb 2 2001
