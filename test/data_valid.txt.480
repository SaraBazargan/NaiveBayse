when the irish hunger memorial opened last july in battery park city the sheer antiquity of the materials commanded awe in downtown manhattan the pedestal was made from kilkenny limestone age 300 million years the fieldstone cottage meant to represent the dwellings where if they were not evicted onto the roads the irish peasantry starved during the 19th century potato famine had stood since the 1820 's until it was cut into pieces and reassembled in new york last year even though most of the memorial had shouldered up against centuries of atlantic gales and the long drizzle of western ireland winters it was shut down in late april for emergency repairs that are expected to continue until the end of june officials said yesterday the culprit was not the ancient ruins the modern materials used to reassemble them did not last through the first harsh new york winter said timothy carey the president and chief executive of the battery park city authority the new elements of the memorial which was assembled at a cost of 5 million were essentially melting away in the rain or blowing away in the wind mr carey said rainwater and melting snow spilled over the north and south sides of the memorial unchecked by dozens of plants from the irish countryside visitors trampled over unpaved ground creating paths where none had been planned the fallow potato furrows were spoiled mr carey was particularly incensed by a composite material used on the main pathways that was meant to simulate an old irish lane he called it poly pavement it performed miserably he said it was this claylike substance it got slippery when wet it got wet pretty often over the last six blustery months and the slipping problem was compounded by poor drainage on the site that was something of a surprise since the base of the entire memorial about a quarter acre is tilted off the ground making the approach to the cottage feel like a climb along a hilly country lane and seeming to confer natural drainage qualities that would not be available on a flat site however the drainage system also relied on a selection of young irish plants that apparently were not able to hold the water until it could sluice into the proper channels mr carey said brian g tolle the artist who designed the memorial had a different view of the construction he said the memorial was opened before all the waterproofing work was finished it 's not corrective work he said it 's unfinished work the memorial is a striking presence in lower manhattan set on the hudson river about two blocks west of the world trade center site when it opened it received a glowing review in the new york times from roberta smith an arts critic who suggested it might be the new york city equivalent of the vietnam veterans memorial in washington she wrote that it was an unconventional work of public art that strikes a deep emotional chord sums up its artistic moment for a broad audience and expands the understanding of what a public memorial can be the project had been a personal interest of gov george e pataki whose maternal grandmother emigrated from ireland and who has successfully crusaded for lessons on the irish potato famine of the late 1840 's in the state elementary school curriculum the battery park city authority is controlled by the governor mr carey accompanied mr pataki on a visit to ireland where they discussed the memorial site the president of ireland mary mcaleese spoke at a dinner on july 15 to mark its opening and took note of the memorial 's proximity to the absent shadow of the trade center there can be no better next door neighbor for the new memorial for this is now an area where a bustling noisy city silently but powerfully holds its most sacred memories president mcaleese said for some it is not a surprise that even such a well received public monument would less than a year after its opening become a site for orange construction fencing and emergency repairs as the weekly irish voice reports in an issue published today concerns about drainage and safety had been raised on the day the memorial opened by dennis smith the author and retired firefighter in an e mail message to officials at battery park city mr smith suggested that water from the irrigation system would unsettle the concrete and create a problem on the pitched pathway mr carey said he did not recall mr smith 's note mr carey said that while he expects construction to continue until the end of june visitors may be able to return before then a new pathway will be put down that will be more like concrete and less prone to becoming slippery a number of times mr carey made the point that it was not surprising that a season 's worth of visitors would reveal some structural problems the cost of remedying them mr carey said would be 250000 this was not built as a building but as a piece of living art he said
