the musicians strike that has shut down broadway 's musicals claimed its first victim yesterday as the producers of flower drum song the revival of the classic rodgers and hammerstein musical announced that the production would close early barring a quick resolution to the labor crisis the closing notice was not a complete shock the revival had been struggling even before the strike which began on friday and had already been scheduled to have its last performance next sunday but the show 's premature end may be a harbinger of an increasingly unpleasant phase in broadway 's first major labor stoppage in nearly 30 years as the strike enters a new week some of the more painful and practical aspects of the shutdown will begin to become apparent group ticket agencies and discount ticket outlets like tkts will open today with little to sell only 7 of the 24 productions on broadway are playing though off broadway productions are not affected by the strike and are playing normal schedules with only one musical open cabaret which operates on a different contract the six plays on broadway were all reporting increases in sales as audiences thwarted by the strike sought out other entertainment the strike also means no rehearsal for highly anticipated productions like gypsy and nine both of which are on tight timetables because of the busy schedules of their british directors david leveaux and sam mendes too many missed days in the rehearsal hall could force both shows to reschedule their openings then of course there is the matter of payday thursday when there could be no paychecks for hundreds of actors stagehands and others who work backstage if there is no deal layoffs of ushers and other theater workers are also possible no negotiations were held over the weekend but there was some effort to try to produce an agreement between producers and the musicians union whose picket lines are being honored by the industry 's actors and stagehands the executive director of actors equity alan eisenberg was working yesterday to mediate some sort of compromise between the two parties mr eisenberg did not return calls for comment on whether progress had been made on the creative side meanwhile rehearsals for several new shows were canceled with just three weeks before the first scheduled performance of gypsy starring bernadette peters mr mendes and his creative team lost a full day of rehearsal on saturday and were facing more lost rehearsals today still nobody seemed to be panicking you just adapt said arthur laurents who wrote the book for gypsy you have to the composer maury yeston who wrote the music and lyrics for nine struck a similar note it 's not about being worried he said it 's just about having the time to do it the timetable for nine which also lost a rehearsal on saturday and had delayed its previews even before the strike is on an even tighter schedule than gypsy its first preview is now planned for march 21 delays in previews and the shows official openings could also conceivably push back the tony awards deadline the date by which shows must open to be eligible this year that day is may 7 that in turn would shorten the buildup to the awards themselves a period that broadway officials like to use to market the industry as a whole because everyone 's out together everything will be delayed mr yeston said eventually the whole season gets delayed otherwise there will be no one to nominate that may be the least of their worries anger over the strike appeared to be growing yesterday on both sides of the divide it 's utterly irrational and destructive to the city mr laurents said no one wins many on broadway were also increasingly worried that no matter how long the strike lasts the damage to the industry 's image has already been done the longer the strike lasts the more work it will take to get audiences back one producer said the actors may feel a little pinch this week when they do n't get a check but the producers could be hurt by this for a while those comments were echoed by mayor michael r bloomberg at the beginning it 's not so bad because people still come hoping the strike is settled the mayor said if it starts to go on they 'll say 'i 'm not going to plan my trip and that hurts transportation it hurts people in all of the stores it 's a very bad thing
