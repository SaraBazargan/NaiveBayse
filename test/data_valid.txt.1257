in the early 70 's a chemical company on a hilltop above the banks of the delaware in hunterdon county left barrels of waste the site was later placed on the environmental protection agency 's superfund list as one of the most contaminated areas in the country that is the modern history of the land known as the derewal site in kingwood township after the chemical company the cleanup revealed the land 's ancient history before the work could begin an archaeological survey of the property revealed artifacts of indians and prehistoric man a company that specializes in archaeological digs on contaminated property hunter research of trenton did an excavation and found 3000 artifacts dating from 6500 bc through the 1700 's when the turtle clan of the lenapi indians occupied the area the artifacts are now on display at the kingwood township municipal hall sal de sapio township historian talked about the find q what was found at the site a they found 3000 individual pieces but that could be six pieces from the same bowl there may be other things in the area that have not been found people have known for years that this was a good place to find arrowheads some of the items were carbon dated although that is an expensive process so not everything was dated but some of the pieces go back more than 8000 years to 6500 bc when prehistoric man lived in the area most of the artifacts were from the woodland period which was 1000 bc to 1600 ad we have spear tips tools to make arrowheads and arrow shafts ceramic and animal skin cooking utensils and other weapons and tools q why is this find important a the lenapi indians had no written language so the only way we have of knowing how they lived before the europeans arrived is by recreating their lives from things they left behind we now have a comprehensive look at the people who occupied this area q what did the artifacts show a some of the tools and weapons that were found here were made from rocks that came from central pennsylvania and upstate new york which meant these people traveled quite far when you consider they were walking they also appeared to have traded with other people the archaeologists found cooking areas so we know they lived in the area although the site was not occupied continuously the way things were found in layers it seems they moved around staying here at different periods in time q why did the township want the exhibit a usually when these things are found they are turned over to the state museum but they probably would have just been stored away somewhere we got permission for the township to keep the artifacts so we could put them on display because this is part of our history we agreed to make the artifacts available for study to anyone who wants to look at them q what else is known about the indians of the area a in 1703 the europeans signed a treaty with the indians for the purchase of 150000 acres of land which was most of southwestern hunterdon county the purchase price was goods worth 700 english pounds so the europeans thought they got a good deal but the indians probably thought they got a good deal too because they got guns steel tools metal cooking utensils needles scissors and many other things that made their lives easier they got 21 cooking pots so we know there were probably 21 families there were 30 drawing knives so there were probably 30 adult males karen demasters
