the preference of mariano rivera and roger clemens is to rest during the all star game break rather than pitch but they have been so good this year that they will probably not have a choice as manager joe torre selects all stars among his own players rivera has 23 saves and clemens is 10 1 and appears to be a front runner to start the game he 's a lock said derek jeter the yankees shortstop i do n't make the decision for mr t and i do n't want to jinx the guy but i 'd say he 's pretty much a shoo in rivera is second in the league in saves and would seem to be an easy pick as perhaps the sport 's most dominating closer but rivera like clemens would be just as pleased if he were left off the team if they do n't pick me i 'd be happy said rivera who if he is not picked would stay in new york during the three days off or return to his home in panama i could go home to be with my family jeter could be going to seattle for the all star game as well despite struggling for much of the first half of the season and catcher jorge posada and reliever mike stanton have also merited consideration jeter who turns 27 on tuesday has been a part of the american league all star team the past three years he is hitting 283 with 21 extra base hits 44 runs and 36 runs batted in alex rodriguez of texas leads jeter in the voting and would be named the starting shortstop if it ends that way but torre as the american league manager selects the reserves and there seem to be few other shortstop candidates in the league nomar garciaparra of boston a perennial all star candidate has been hurt and miguel tejada of oakland is having an off year jeter likes going to the all star game you have a good time you have the whole experience and the players are excited about doing that he said it 's fun posada an all star for the first time last year leads the yankees with 13 home runs and 57 rbi his average hovering around 300 most of this season stanton 34 has never been picked for an all star team and he said before the yankees game today that he was trying not to think about it if i start worrying about that he said then i 'll stop worrying about my real job and that is getting guys out the devil rays proceeded to beat the yankees and stanton was charged with the loss nevertheless stanton has the statistics to support his candidacy with a 5 2 record and a 187 earned run average and torre having used stanton in about half the yankees games is fully aware how important stanton has been to the team this year he certainly has all star numbers and his manager is the manager torre said but stanton is a set up man and very few set up men are picked as all stars i would n't say that i 'm at a disadvantage he said history would n't be on my side but who knows clemens 38 repeated today that he would prefer to rest during the all star game break and to give a chance for some pitcher who has not gone to the game to go in his place at my age rest is always good said clemens who intends to talk to torre and the yankees pitching coach mel stottlemyre at a more appropriate time but it appears clemens 's performance this season and the timing of his last two starts before the all star game on july 10 make him a favorite to start for the american league and perhaps face mike piazza of the mets clemens will probably make his last start before the break in baltimore on july 4 or 5 and will be fully rested torre could also start aaron sele of seattle who is 8 1 or pedro martinez of boston generally considered the best pitcher in baseball in spite of his five cy young awards clemens has started the all star game only once in 1986 torre also has the option of picking clemens for his team and holding him in reserve as he did in 1997 to be used only in the event the game goes into extra innings
