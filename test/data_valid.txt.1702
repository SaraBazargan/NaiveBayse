kerry kittles was the last player in the gym today quietly working on his jump shot his fellow nets starters had retreated to the showers his closest friend on the team had been traded over the summer while kittles was honeymooning in greece he is the sole survivor of a bygone nets era a willow limbed guard whose right knee has been surgically repaired four times but for kittles it is no longer enough for him to be a symbol of perseverance everybody expects more from kerry i think he 's expecting more from himself coach byron scott said we 're putting a little pressure on him to play better expectations for us and for him are to be better than they were last season like the nets last season kittles was a surprise not only did he return from a one year layoff after radical knee surgery but kittles also played in all 82 regular season games for the first time since his rookie season 1996 97 add the playoffs and the preseason and he totaled 110 games he did not keep count past 82 or dance for joy at 110 that 's not my way he said like the nets too kittles is focused on more than just improving his numbers 134 points a game and 466 percent shooting from the field last season as the nets went 52 30 then advanced to the nba finals i want to be able to dribble the ball better create my shot whenever i have to i want to be able to shoot the ball more consistently from the field i want to be able to shut my man down better than i did last year he said already kittles 's conditioning and work ethic have impressed scott in the first two days of training camp the injury he had to us it 's not even a question anymore scott said he can deal with the schedule the traveling and everything else and being ready to play kittles is wearing a protective band around the knee and said it felt pretty good though he was not willing to give it a 100 percent seal the oddest feeling of the preseason for kittles is playing without keith van horn obviously it 's tough for me he said you play with someone for five years you develop a relationship but you understand it 's a business only five days before the nets traded van horn to philadelphia van horn was at kittles 's wedding you know how it goes you 're just open to the fact in the summertime anyone can get traded except jason kittles said kittles happily returned to a team led by jason kidd and sporting the newcomer dikembe mutombo a stronger kenyon martin and a promoted richard jefferson he 'll probably get lost in the shuffle with dikembe and r j and kenyon and i think that will help take the pressure off of him kidd said of kittles he was huge for us last year kittles lived and lurked in the wings at times providing instant offense off the fast break and at other times disappearing into shooting slumps but when he was 1 for 10 in game 3 of the first round playoff series against the indiana pacers kittles hit the winning 3 pointer a defining moment for him and the franchise and after going 0 for 17 in the boston series kittles led the nets in scoring the next three games kerry is almost like the forgotten guy scott said he 's a guy that can get it lit up in one quarter just as well as anybody hopefully everybody does pay attention to those other guys and leaves kerry alone both he and kittles are looking for consistency now that injury is no longer an issue if you 're hurt you do n't have fun kittles said i feel refreshed i 'm just enjoying the game rebounds byron scott knows he will have to wait for chris childs 's achilles tendon to heal but in the meantime he is concerned about childs 's fitness obviously he 's overweight scott said adding that childs 's weight could have put extra strain on the achilles when he started to work out again lucious harris did not practice in the evening session because of turf toe
