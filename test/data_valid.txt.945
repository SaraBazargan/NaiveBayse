two weeks ago the new york state legislature voted to change all school district budget and trustee elections from may 20 to june 3 as a result the 39 school district budget votes in westchester county have been postponed to the later date according to janet s walker executive director of the westchester putnam school boards association while an inconvenience for most districts the date change has proved to be a costly and potentially worrisome predicament in new rochelle where voters are deciding not only on a school budget but also on the fiscal future of the city 's library if residents do not approve a proposed 296 million library budget to be financed by a new citywide tax the new rochelle public library may close supporters of the new library tax had printed banners fliers bookmarks buttons and bumper stickers all with the old election date may 20 prominently displayed all of that material is now not only misleading but also wrong so library employees and volunteers have been painstakingly changing the date by hand the library 's four large election banners have been taped over with handmade lettering to read june 3 some 2000 bookmarks with the wrong dates have been hand corrected and 2000 new ones printed five hundred lawn signs about the vote date are being stickered over with newly printed and correctly dated stickers as are 10000 fliers 2000 buttons and 1000 bumper stickers said lynn green a founder of the new rochelle public library foundation which paid for much of the informational material we have to keep our supporters enthused so apathy does n't set in said thomas leghorn one of two library trustees up for re election on june 3 he pointed out that the library 's board paid for the printing and mailing of 26000 notices one for every household in new rochelle with a list of polling places and the election date now incorrect it cost all of the 8000 we had in our budget mr leghorn said and we do n't have the money to redo it with the correct date in case word of the date change does n't get to every voter new rochelle 's library board hopes to place large explicit signs at all 13 polling places in the city on may 20 to advise mistaken potential voters to return to vote on june 3
