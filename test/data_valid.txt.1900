each night at 8 eastern time about 322000 people settle in to watch the news with brian williams on msnbc a small audience even by the slight ratings standards of cable these ratings were noted inside the television industry on tuesday when nbc said that mr williams would succeed tom brokaw in 2004 as the anchor of nbc nightly news nbc is staking the future of its flagship newscast on an anchor whose program has not drawn an average audience anywhere near those of his direct cable competitors bill o'reilly on the fox news channel up to two million and the point and live from programs shown on cnn more than 700000 the cable ratings have raised the question of how well mr williams will do in the far more competitive battle of network evening news inside the business critics some of them competitors say mr williams 's skills at articulately delivering the news can be undermined by an impersonal style that translates to some viewers as pompous and off putting his speaking comes off as overwrought and flowery said andrew tyndall publisher of the tyndall report a newsletter that monitors network news he has yet to develop a vernacular style whether that is why his cable program has lagged its competitors is an open question as is whether his style will harm the top rated nightly news when he does succeed mr brokaw nbc executives said that mr williams 's gifts far outweigh his flaws and that his cable ratings should not be taken as a sign of things to come they said mr williams 's ratings problems have nothing to do with his skills as a broadcaster which they consider formidable and everything to do with the evolving tastes of the cable news audience and the way the news with brian williams is scheduled for one mr williams 's program is repeated throughout the night on msnbc and cnbc it is shown five times from 8 pm to 3 am the heavy repetition executives said undercuts the program 's potential for building a sizable audience at 8 pm the average audiences of all of the program 's showings on msnbc and cnbc add up to a more respectable 11 million people though that is still far fewer people than tune in for the o'reilly factor at 8 pm mr o'reilly 's success nbc executives said provides another possible explanation for why mr williams 's program has not done so well in cable the original idea behind the news with brian williams was that the young on the go viewers msnbc was built to reach were at work during the evening newscasts and would flock to a straightforward prime time news program the large audiences for mr o'reilly who brings his own analysis to the issues of the day convinced the executives that the cable news audience was generally well informed by 8 pm and was looking for a lively deconstruction of the news at that hour mr williams 's traditional anchor style then may be ill suited for 8 pm on msnbc and may seem too straight to many in the cable news audience this is why the executives said msnbc is shifting its prime time format over to talk programs like hardball with chris matthews and a new program with phil donahue and bumping mr williams 's program solely to cnbc at 10 pm the hope is that the news with brian williams will draw in that spot at least close to the same audience it does during all of its nightly showings mr williams meanwhile will be able to keep trying to improve upon his technique tom wolzien senior media analyst at sanford c bernstein and a former nbc news executive said mr williams 's cable performance should not be considered a portent for nbc nightly news with brian williams though most expect it to take a dip in the ratings when mr brokaw steps down no matter what mr williams mr wolzien said seems to fit the mold of the traditional evening news just fine i think there is an expected product in a nightly newscast that i think we 've seen him deliver he said however he said nbc news should be patient with mr williams if you 're the management you have to make a judgment based on what you have today and based on what you see as that person 's ability to develop he said you 're making a bet that they have the raw material to grow and evolve
