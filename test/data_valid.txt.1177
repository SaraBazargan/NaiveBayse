if someone had been pulled from the crowd at the tortoise show at irving plaza transported to american bandstand circa 1960 and asked by dick clark to evaluate the music of this chicago band she might have said it 's got a great beat and you do n't have to dance to it tortoise the instigator of an underground style shortsightedly labeled post rock and now accepted as the friendlier end of the avant garde makes instrumental music based on precise rhythms that register more in the head than in the hips this is n't meant to underestimate the band 's attempt to engage the body on standards thrill jockey its latest and most lightsome album but in aiming for something other than the gut tortoise devises a new context in which to appreciate pop 's pleasures it is pop at this point because tortoise blithely mixes sources and stresses maximum impact although philip glass 's mimimalism was the first obvious influence at last wednesday 's concert the music 's tight structures soon gave enough to let much more slip in standards has been called a jazz fusion album and tortoise 's previous efforts have often been linked to progressive rock especially the german style known as kraut rock but jeff parker 's guitar sometimes recalled the ambitious classic rock of jeff beck while the music 's vibraphone and keyboard combinations evoked the art film scores of nino rota two adroit drummers johnny herndon and john mcentire set the mood for most songs although on some slower numbers the center formed around doug mccombs 's resonant bass at times the stringed instruments resembled the suave nashville sound of the guitarist floyd cramer the live musicians were augmented by electronic beats and samples some apparently trigged by the keyboardist dan bitney most band members switched places occasionally moving from drums to vibraphones to keyboards and lending some visual excitement that a singer might have otherwise provided by doing without a vocalist or soloists in general tortoise removes its focus from individual melodic lines highlighting the subtleties of arrangement and interplay for all its virtuosity the band rarely improvised its variations emerging more through shifting tones the sound was least intriguing when it coalesced the most aggressively in passages that skewed toward admittedly loud lounge jazz risking hackneyed moments may be part of its strategy as it places itself within music history at first listen its new standards could seem surprisingly old hat welcoming pop comparisons that true avant gardists would shun but by complicating these agreeable tunes at their rhythmic root tortoise courted accessibility without sacrificing the head games closest to its heart
