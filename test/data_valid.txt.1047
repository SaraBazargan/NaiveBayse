two years ago in jordan a 17 year old girl became pregnant after being raped by a family friend instead of reporting the rapist the girl 's father and brother shot her eight times and left her for dead like many other women in jordan who are threatened by their families she was sent to jail for her own protection after receiving medical care thousands of times each year a woman is murdered somewhere in the world by her father or brothers for acts that are seen as besmirching the family 's honor including committing adultery defying a parental order to marry being seen in public with a man or becoming the victim of rape a crime that many people still believe could not happen without the victim 's consent a united nations special investigator earlier this year named 12 countries where she had received reports of honor killings in the middle east south asia europe latin america and africa but such killings are most common in islamic nations earlier this month the un passed its first resolution condemning honor killings unfortunately the resolution which had been introduced by the netherlands was watered down and even that version did not achieve a consensus instead 20 nations abstained including russia china jordan and pakistan a strong and unanimous resolution though absent enforcement mechanisms could have been helpful to local activists they could use it to show that the world condemns such killings and demand that their governments punish honor murderers and change laws that condone these crimes but for now offending governments can paint the resolution as an imposition by the west honor killings are most common in poor rural areas it is impossible to know the extent of these crimes because most take place in repressive countries where reporting is poor but pakistan 's independent human rights commission estimated that there were 1000 such killings last year a university study in yemen found 400 in 1997 many men who commit honor killings cite the koran but most scholars say there is no justification in islam for these crimes they are a manifestation of the social pressures of traditional societies which hold that women are the property of the family whose honor rests on their obedience and virginity many governments have laws that reduce or even eliminate sentences for murderers who kill in defense of family honor in syria penalties are reduced for those who murder a woman caught in a suspicious state with another person jordan 's government has sought to change laws that provide short sentences for these crimes but the tougher penalties have been defeated twice in the lower house of parliament where deputies argue that they would promote adultery and harm public morality activists in jordan have staged large public demonstrations for stiffer penalties for honor killings changes supported by queen noor and queen rania but jordan was the country most active in opposition to a strong un resolution the un lost an opportunity to take a firm stand against one of the world 's most offensive and medieval practices
