there is the videotape that shows indiana coach bob knight with a hand on the throat of neil reed a former basketball player during a hoosier practice there is the promise from john walda one of the university trustees investigating the incident that there are no sacred cows at indiana university and that includes the basketball program there have been polls within the state showing that most people think knight should remain indiana 's basketball coach just as there have been editorials and columns from across the nation that argue he should be fired what will happen to one of the most successful and galvanizing coaches in college basketball when the university concludes its investigation will not be known until the trustees release their report on or before june 20 both supporters and critics of knight agree however that the basketball coach with three national championships 11 big ten titles and an equally gaudy collection of explosive and headline grabbing behavior is in the deepest trouble of his 29 year career at indiana i 'm not sure we 're looking at a firing of coach knight but we are n't looking at him getting no punishment either said mike pegram who recently helped organize a rally for supporters of knight and who owns and operates a web site that attracts 100000 hits a day from hoosier basketball supporters it is a tough situation murray sperber an english and american studies professor at indiana agrees he is in more trouble than he 's ever been in for a couple of reasons said sperber the author of several books on college sports the faculty is more upset with him than they have ever been the videotape shows he grabbed him by neck it 's not a smoking gun but as close as you get many faculty members already are unhappy with how the university has chosen to investigate the abuse charges that reed leveled against knight they say that no matter what the outcome the university will not be served by what they argue is a narrow inquiry that treats the basketball coach with more deference than faculty members it 's not a credible investigation said david b pisoni the chancellors professor of psychology and cognitive science it 's not independent it 's not objective it 's not legitimate it 's not going to provide a credible assessment of what the reality is it 's bad for the coach it 's bad for the university the faculty 's distrust of the investigation according to pisoni and sperber has as much to do with the trustees conducting it as with knight 's past controversial behavior the list of incidents involving knight is long he was charged with assaulting a policeman in puerto rico while a coach at the 1979 pan american games he flung a chair across the assembly hall floor in 1985 he made inappropriate remarks about rape in a 1988 interview with connie chung and he served a one game suspension in 1993 for kicking his son patrick then a hoosier player and now an assistant coach during a timeout as divisive as those incidents have been however they do not compare to the uproar among faculty that was caused by how the trustees last spring conducted a five year review of indiana president myles brand the trustees chief among them walda departed from the usual procedure of a broad based six to nine month review of the university president 's performance by committees of students alumni staff members and predominately faculty the trustees instead hired an outside consultant to conduct a six week review which was criticized by faculty for being hurried incomplete and dismissive of their views faculty members say a similar desultory effort is under way with regard to knight 's actions and point to the fact that the investigation is being limited to reed 's allegations reed started 72 games for the hoosiers before transferring to southern mississippi in 1997 the year he says knight choked him in a television report containing those charges reed and other former players cited detailed instances of abuse by knight including knight 's brandishing soiled toilet paper as a motivational tool there have been other allegations in the wake of the reed report as well including a claim by the former hoosier ricky calloway that knight punched steve alford and butch carter a former hoosier player who is now the toronto raptors coach charges in his recently published book that knight directed a racial slur at his teammate isiah thomas alford and thomas have denied the incidents occurred christopher simpson vice president for public affairs and special counsel to the president at indiana said the university was taking the investigation extraordinarily serious but confirmed it was confined to reed 's allegation every day since the review was announced there have been sensationalist allegations some two decades old he said they are hotly in dispute and we have no intention of looking into whether they occurred or not but many faculty members are angered that more recent and substantiated allegations are being ignored as well including an incident between knight and indiana athletic director clarence doninger after a game against ohio state on feb 19 that was serious enough for doninger to report to a university vice president faculty members also wonder how objective walda and the other trustee in charge of the investigation frederick eichhorn can be when reed leveled his charges last month on the eve of the national collegiate athletic association basketball tournament the video of the throat grabbing incident had not yet emerged at that time walda a lawyer in fort wayne appeared skeptical of reed 's account i 'm speaking as a board member walda told the indianapolis star as a lawyer i would put no stock in it neither walda nor eichhorn is available for comment while the investigation proceeds according to simpson knight was also unavailable for comment another faculty complaint is that knight though a full professor in the department of health physical education and recreation is not being held to the same stringent standards as faculty members would be sperber said he has received about 500 responses in the form of e mail messages letters or telephone calls from students faculty and alumni since the reed tape was televised he said the responses have been slightly more negative than positive perhaps showing that knight 's support has begun to erode i know if any faculty member grabbed a student by the neck he or she would be in maximum trouble sperber said they would be immediately suspended when more students came forward with allegations they would not be ignored they would lose their tenure and be fired simpson says that knight however is being investigated for his actions as a basketball coach and not as a faculty member he acknowledges that indiana is setting a precedent by appointing trustees to investigate the allegations and this worries many faculty members any institution has a hard time investigating itself especially on a hot button issue like this sperber said it 's almost an impossible task to start with and the trustees do n't have a good track record maybe they will prove me wrong but i 'm skeptical
