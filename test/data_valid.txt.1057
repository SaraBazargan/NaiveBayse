my parents have long told me their stories of growing up during the great depression i heard how my dad delivered groceries for a dollar a week and how his family ate meat once a week with the leftovers stretched thinner and thinner into the next few meals for my father james 76 especially the great depression has had a lasting effect he 's eating much better now but he refuses to put his money into any investment where he is n't guaranteed to get his principal back he 's not stuffing money into mattresses but his insistence on safety has meant he has sat out the bull market several of them actually my lectures on the dangers of inflation and the historical return of the stock market have not had as much effect on him as those sparse chicken dinners he puts his money almost exclusively in certificates of deposit and savings bonds and that 's that the man will just not listen to me dad i say do n't put all your money into cd 's diversify try some mutual funds too risky he says i would n't be able to sleep at night the sleep indicator is as important to my father 's generation as the gdp is to mine we get frustrated seeing our parents life savings invested at 6 percent but they expect to sleep very soundly when it comes to their money although our parents are very fond of us often those feelings do n't run deep enough to take investment advice from their reckless children giovanni s testa 43 of livingston nj said he has tried for years to get his father marino 75 also of livingston to invest more wisely but to no avail with stocks my father thinks he 'll lose all of it he said i try to explain risk to him but he did n't understand it forgetaboutit it was like talking to a wall talking to my father richard j nemec 54 of hinckley ohio never could get through to his father but he understood why he tended to be quite nearsighted and ultraconservative mr nemec said let 's face it when a man has gone through the depression and world war ii and then lived in a nice suburb he gets very comfortable with his station in life my father was a blue collar worker and money came hard he did n't want to take a chance on losing it mr nemec 's father died in 1992 and his mother lillian 79 was more open to change he had her meet with his planner paul a hrisko it was a big change for her and she asked an awful lot of questions said mr hrisko a certified financial planner who owns paul hrisko associates in cleveland heights ohio is it safe is it guaranteed what are my chances of losing my money it did n't take one meeting i had to come back several times she was a bit nervous the more i discussed it with her the more she was willing to take the next step to a more aggressive portfolio mr hrisko said children must explain the investments and their risks fully and clearly children should also help their parents clarify their goals to determine how much risk is acceptable is the money for them their children or their grandchildren the key mr hrisko said is the parent must trust the child the senior mr testa moved slowly into mutual funds after his son persuaded him to see an investment adviser and he saw how diversification could keep his risk low but increase his return gail rosen 41 of martinsville ny talked to her father for years about leaving savings bonds behind he resisted at first but he trusted her enough to move some money into mutual funds now he 's hooked my dad has a computer and watches his funds online said ms rosen an accountant now he tells me how i 'm doing on my investments he 's so addicted that my mother hates it that he 's on the computer all the time like some wives lose their husbands to golf she 's lost him to the computer her father irving horowitz 72 of monroe township nj said he changed after his daughter showed him how much money he was losing to inflation and taxes she 's an accountant so i listened he said eventually moving money into funds and individual stocks since i retired i have made a hobby of it my father 's hobby is his garden and keeping his principal safe i know his greatest concern is not for his children or his grandchildren but for my mother mary he wants to leave her secure and comfortable if anything happens to him if his principal is safe he knows she will be too he could have a better strategy but that 's not a bad one it 's a heartfelt plan that this son is going to stop arguing with
