the baseball fates played a cruel joke on the oakland athletics last year after losing to the yankees in the maximum five games in the first round of the playoffs the previous two seasons the athletics escaped their nemesis in the opening round last year playing minnesota instead they thought the fates were with them but for the athletics the outcome was no different from the previous two octobers they lost to the twins also in five games and went home after the first round seven months later the athletics came to yankee stadium they left with two victories in three games in the weekend series it was no consolation prize but it was in scott hatteberg 's words a great confidence builder for us taking two of three here is huge he said how huge was it this was the 10th series of the season for the yankees and no team had won two of three from them at home or anywhere else the yankees in fact were the last team in major league baseball to lose a series that 's how good and how consistent they have been they wo n't match the detroit tigers 35 5 start of 1984 but 23 8 is impressive enough it 's better than anyone else in the majors this season but that 's what was so impressive about the athletics achievement during the weekend they split the first two games then watched yesterday as barry zito outpitched roger clemens in a 2 0 victory again in the words of hatteberg oakland 's first baseman this last game was a battle of cy young versus cy old the 24 year old zito last year 's american league cy young award winner against the 40 year old clemens winner of six cy young awards a teammate of clemens in boston for 10 weeks early in his major league career hatteberg offered the observation saturday then fretted that clemens might take it the wrong way i do n't feel i said anything wrong hatteberg said yesterday i just did n't want anyone to interpret it wrong especially him it was a compliment if anything i did n't mean anything derogatory by it all i meant was barry 's young and he 's older i was trying to be cute and it did n't work presumably unknown to hatteberg the comment did not originate with him mike flanagan the former baltimore orioles pitcher made the same remark 20 years ago about himself and his older teammate jim palmer ken singleton their teammate and a yankees television analyst recalled yesterday but hatteberg went to great lengths to praise clemens calling him an absolute warrior a hero of mine one of the greatest players of all time a pitcher who owns me a cy young award winner who collects them like baseball cards and this was after hatteberg hit a first inning home run against clemens it 's a huge highlight in my career hatteberg said i was just lucky that i got a pitch to hit it was a fastball he kind of left it over the plate which he does n't do often i was just able to get it up in the air zito made some mistakes but got away with them in shutting out the yankees on four hits in eight innings there were his two defensive misplays in the fourth inning for example the yankees had todd zeile at second base and jason giambi at first with no one out when bernie williams hit a grounder back to the mound that had double play written on the ball in words larger than rawlings but zito bobbled the ball twice and barely got one out at first with the runners at second and third hideki matsui hit another grounder to zito this time he fielded it cleanly but he instantly threw the ball home where zeile was not headed no zito explained afterward he did n't think the bases were loaded i was thinking he was breaking on contact zito said usually you look at him and give it up to the guy at home in this case i forgot looking at him and went home but he was five feet off the base thank goodness we got an out the athletics recorded an out because catcher mark johnson made a remarkably heads up play and good throw to second where miguel tejada tagged giambi trying to get back zito 's fielders rescued him in the seventh inning too with two on and no one out eric byrnes caught bubba trammell 's fly ball against the left field fence it scared me a little bit but i 'm ok zito said to third baseman eric chavez who then made a nice stop of john flaherty 's hard grounder and turned it into an inning ending double play it goes against the yankee mystique does n't it byrnes said alluding to the way the inning turned in oakland 's favor usually it seems like that ball goes out and the next ball goes through tide 's turning huh byrnes pitcher tim hudson said i did n't say that byrnes replied they have some magic in this place but the athletics who have no more regular season trips to new york will be happy to return in october despite their previous postseason experiences zito had only one reservation i never sleep well in new york he said we know how intense these games are even when you 're not pitching and playing the city coming out to yankee stadium is huge we get fired up for these games i did n't sleep well last night i was restless i 'm pretty exhausted right now my body 's real worn out from not getting 12 hours but zito will be here in five months if this is where the playoffs take them to be anywhere in october is ideal he said we missed the yanks last year in the first round and it did n't work out for us i always like coming to new york though zito might even figure out how to sleep here maybe a sleeping pill he said yesterday he threw sleeping pills at the yankees
