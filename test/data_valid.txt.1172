the sun came up an hour early this morning if you remembered to set your clocks back last night that is that sudden flush of morning light is autumn 's little dividend and just at a time of year when it 's been seeming harder and harder to get up naturally what we 'll notice most this evening this afternoon is the early onset of darkness the certain herald of winter if you can just stay focused on that extra morning light a bright sky by 6 it almost eases the trauma of sunset by 5 the jump backward in fall and forward in spring exposes for a day or two the convention of time itself today we resume what might be called natural time canceling the adjustment we make for summer and yet winter 's time is really no more natural than daylight saving time timekeeping is an agreement among humans and yet the thought that this is natural time somehow will not go away it makes one wonder what it would be like to pass through summer without observing daylight saving time on the summer solstice the sun would stride broadly over the horizon just after 4 in the morning and go down husbanding the day about 7 30 few of us are really ready for that it 's no wonder we feel relieved when daylight saving time resumes in april it may be that we 're just a procrastinating species unable to rouse ourselves to a summer morning that begins at 4 either way we 're sliding into the time of year when there is barely enough day to go around a time when we learn to savor darkness all over again
