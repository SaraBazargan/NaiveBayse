when jets coach herman edwards walked into his team 's locker room sunday night he found players who were not acting as if they had just won an important game it was like no one was really excited that we won the game because of that score edwards said referring to the 42 36 victory over the bills at buffalo i said 'enjoy it guys because the guys in the other locker room are not enjoying it we 'll correct the mistakes even when you win and you slam somebody you still look at bad plays it was a nice touch that the defense received a game ball it created five turnovers four leading to scores the defense has forced 13 turnovers and the team leads the league in turnover differential at plus 11 the offense seemed at least on sunday to be evolving into something closer to the west coast ideal it is aiming for with 32 runs and 25 passes including 5 catches by laveranues coles 2 by wayne chrebet and 3 by tight end anthony becht the jets needed all the big plays they made because the defense is still struggling with the routine ones even in the first moments after the victory edwards noted that the run defense remained unsound it is clearly his top concern the bills offense which entered the game ranked near the bottom of the league produced 473 yards and continued to expose the jets run defense which gave up 162 yards as a work needing progress the secondary was also burned for two deep touchdown passes eric moulds beat cornerback marcus coleman in the right flat for a 46 yard touchdown and safety chris hayes missed an open field tackle that gave peerless price a 70 yard touchdown i think the team is really going to have to look at this game and decide did we improve on things or did the ball just bounce our way linebacker mo lewis said we ca n't look at this as if we 've arrived by the jets count there were seven missed tackles a vast improvement from 18 last week the linebackers who had an atypically poor game against san francisco last week were back to normal sunday combining for 38 tackles including 16 by james farrior whom edwards called a force lewis freed by the defensive coordinator ted cottrell to blitz was an enormous mischief maker sacking buffalo quarterback rob johnson and causing a fumble that was returned for a touchdown lewis later returned a fumble for a touchdown but there were still gaping holes in the middle of the defensive line which the bills rookie travis henry ran through like the winner of a one minute shopping spree on a second quarter drive that led to a field goal henry ran up the middle 4 times for 35 yards henry who had averaged 25 yards a carry entering the game improved his average to 34 yards after gaining 113 yards on 19 carries jets defensive end shaun ellis who had five sacks in the first seven games last season has none so far this season as a result despite the big plays that won the game against buffalo the jets defense continued to plummet statistically dropping from 25th to 30th in the league the defense continues to be last in the league against the run yielding 164 yards a game that ranking is not such great news when lamar smith of the dolphins who rushed for 144 yards against new england sunday is coming to town on sunday there were three runs 18 17 19 yards edwards said those were big runs and it was into the teeth of the defense we did n't play it correctly if we play it right it 's not a big run if we play it right it 's maybe a 3 yard gain in the next two weeks the jets play host to the dolphins and the rams miami is fifth in the league in rushing yards a game st louis has marshall faulk one of the league 's best offensive players the jets will need to create a lot of turnovers to offset those offenses in meetings the night before games the jets coaches lay out goals one is to produce turnovers another stop the run just like their record the jets are 500 extra points receiver laveranues coles strained knee is questionable for sunday safety nick ferguson foot is also questionable as is safety damien robinson left ankle leaving the jets with two healthy safeties returner chad morton ankle remains questionable the good news santana moss ran for the first time monday moss ran straight with no cutting coach herman edwards said he would remind moss not to rush his return linebacker mo lewis will most likely have to wait a few days to learn if he will be fined for the elbow to rob johnson 's head that knocked johnson out of the game johnson thought the hit was dirty the jets do not lewis knocked out drew bledsoe the week before the problem he 's got is he 's got two quarterbacks edwards said i just got sent a tape on quarterback hits from the league they 're trying to protect quarterbacks rightly so the problem is some of these guys are athletic they run out of the pocket and they do n't run to the sideline he 's a ball carrier now
