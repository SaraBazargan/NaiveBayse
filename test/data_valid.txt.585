the giants practices have had more medical implements than footballs over the last month players adorned with protective boots and crutches and heavy knee wraps but coach jim fassel is optimistic that by next week almost all of the injured parties on his roster should be ready to participate in practice including tight end jeremy shockey and cornerback will peterson because the giants do n't play again until oct 28 in a monday night matchup in philadelphia they will have four full days to prepare for the eagles giving the recovering players a window of opportunity to get back into game shape peterson and the others are expected to play against the eagles and their star quarterback donovan mcnabb but it remains to be seen how quickly they can recover their conditioning after being limited in their movements for weeks nothing replaces the true work on the field but you can get close fassel said as integral to the team 's success as any player peterson dislocated the second toe on his left foot against the st louis rams sept 15 and over the next three weeks his practice time downshifted dramatically he went from full participation to working in individual drills to complete rest peterson did not make it to halftime of the giants game against dallas oct 6 and he was inactive for last sunday 's loss to the falcons peterson 's condition has prevented him from running in practice and ultimately he may require surgery but over the last couple of weeks peterson has arrived at giants stadium early in the morning to work out on the stairmaster keeping his weight off the front of his left foot and has also used an elliptical machine by doing these particular exercises peterson can elevate his heart rate and maintain at least some of his conditioning without jarring his injured foot peterson goes through a second round of workouts inside the stadium while teammates begin practice outside peterson joins them about 30 minutes or so into practice standing on the sidelines in blue sweat pants and watching them often with a playlist in his hand the best exercise for a cornerback like peterson is running sprinting forward backpedaling turning and cutting peterson has not been able to do those things but he said today i 'll definitely be ready some of the giants other injured players such as linebacker and special teams player nick greisen who is recovering from a broken foot involve players who have part time roles some of the injured players have been able to work out vigorously in spite of their ailments kenny holmes the giants right defensive end has a torn muscle near his right elbow and he has gone through a series of sprints every day as he watched practices holmes 's injury affects his strength he said and his ability to ward off blockers but he should be in game condition michael strahan who missed much of last sunday 's game because of back spasms has not practiced this week but should be ready to resume full activity next week shockey is nursing turf toe on his left foot and a sore left ankle and today he moved much more freely than he has in weeks as he watched practice like peterson shockey has been limited in his cardiovascular conditioning and like peterson shockey 's position typically requires him to run at full speed for about 50 to 70 plays per game fassel said peterson and shockey will be monitored for signs of fatigue during the game against the eagles i think they 'll be fine but we 'll watch them fassel said more than anything you become cognizant of how many plays you are on the field you 've just got to watch it extra points johnnie lynn the giants defensive coordinator missed practice the last two days after having minor throat surgery lynn was at giants stadium after practice thursday and will oversee practices again next week giants coach jim fassel intended to speak with lynn about how to improve the defense 's ability to generate turnovers the giants actually have had a number of chances to recover fumbles and intercept the ball quite literally the football has been in and out of the hands of the defenders brandon short the giants strongside linebacker strained his right hamstring in practice thursday but fassel indicated that the injury was not considered serious dusty zeigler will start again at right guard against the eagles fassel said but there is a chance fassel may juggle the offensive line again sometime
