the air force has finally begun investigating at least 54 reports of sexual assault or rape at the air force academy in colorado over the last decade the air force secretary james roche sounded suitably appalled as he announced this astonishing number of complaints at a congressional hearing this week he worried aloud that there could be more women who had failed to report other incidents and that a rapist could be in the cockpit of an air force jet with a couple of thousand pounds of bombs under his wings the secretary must now move beyond mere concern he must make certain that the air force academy and other training institutions for the american military grasp the obvious rape is not a form of hazing or a rite of passage for women seeking a career in the military rape is a crime the rapist a criminal mr roche 's reaction gives some hope that the high command has finally recognized the academy 's abysmal failure to respond to legitimate complaints by young women cadets victims have said they were blamed for their own lesser infractions of academy rules as part of an approach that deflected their complaints and female cadets described being warned by older colleagues about a culture of rape that victims must accept in silence or risk being hounded from the academy since women make up about 16 percent of the student body the academy brass should have recognized what was going on even before the horror stories began appearing earlier this year in the colorado media the secretary has promised to take a harder look at the academy and the problem in doing so his office could profitably seek guidance from a 1999 report from the national academy of public administration the report recommends that an accusation of a sex crime deserves to be treated as a criminal matter to be dealt with by trained investigators it says further that higher ranking officers in an implicated institution should not be allowed to run the investigation america has long recognized that women belong in the military and female soldiers have made great progress toward being integrated into all branches of the service secretary roche and his colleagues at the pentagon must now make sure that women who are soldiers and especially female cadets do not have to tolerate sexual harassment of any kind to succeed in military life
