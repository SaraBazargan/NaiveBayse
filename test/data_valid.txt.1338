nearly two years after the city selected developers to build central harlem 's first full size supermarket at 145th street and bradhurst avenue the site remains empty two years is hardly a long time when zoning or not in my backyard issues are involved but in this case no such thing stood in the way instead a project that community leaders say is badly needed has been stalled in part by a political campaign reminiscent of the bitter 1995 fight over the pathmark in east harlem when owners of medium sized supermarkets in the neighborhood tried to keep out a large competitor the developers say the project has also suffered because the only two supermarket chains that were interested in the site first pathmark and then big v supermarkets the owners of shoprite stores withdrew from consideration and then sought bankruptcy protection pathmark now reorganized as a public company has recently breathed life into the project by once again considering building a 42000 square foot store on the bradhurst site but the company says the development team led by the related companies which is building a retail and entertainment complex at columbus circle must lower the rent from 30 a square foot to about 20 a square foot which is what they are paying in east harlem to do that the developers say they will either have to get a 5 million low interest government loan or raise the price of the 126 condominiums planned to go for 175000 up to 295000 that are part of the 42 million project in their bid for a public subsidy however the developers have encountered a major roadblock deputy mayor rudy washington whose support is crucial for the project to get financing from the upper manhattan empowerment zone a 300 million program intended to foster local economic development mr washington has resisted freeing up money for the project and instead he has thrown his support behind matthew and mauricio fernandez brothers who own seven smaller grocery stores in harlem and who have said they want to move up to the next level i would like where it 's possible to see people in that community being able to take advantage of the empowerment zone said mr washington the chairman of a board made up of federal state and city officials whose approval is necessary for empowerment zone grants and loans the fernandezes also have the support of latino politicians outside the neighborhood including state senator olga a mendez who represents east harlem and part of the bronx and assemblyman adriano espaillat of inwood working on behalf of the fernandezes is richard lipsky the lobbyist who organized the campaign that nearly derailed the east harlem pathmark mr lipsky complains that the bradhurst developers have been unwilling to negotiate with his clients mr lipsky argues that the fernandez brothers deserve to get the site because their father mateo fernandez a dominican immigrant took a chance on harlem and began opening stores there after the big chains fled to the suburbs the brothers took over after his death in 1996 but gregory o watson the chief operating officer of harlem congregations for community development a nonprofit organization that is part of the development team said that the fernandezes first offered to pay only 12 a square foot for the supermarket space they have failed to respond to a request to revise their plans mr watson said suggesting that they are not serious about opening a new store but merely want to protect their 12000 square foot pioneer store on 145th street and adam clayton powell jr boulevard mr lipsky denied that his clients were trying to block the bradhurst store but said that they would prefer to own the space rather than lease it community board 10 which represents the bradhurst area has not taken an official position on the supermarket but the chairman stanley gleaton said that the fernandez brothers stores got mixed reviews from residents he said that after some residents visited shoprite 's mount vernon store the chain became the community 's first choice for bradhurst ideally i would like to see a viable chain there he said a big v vice president stephen l hittman said his company decided to withdraw from the project several months before it filed for bankruptcy protection in november we liked the location but it was a somewhat unusual configuration he said similarly a senior vice president of pathmark harvey gutman said his company 's bankruptcy had nothing to do with its original decision to back out of bradhurst we passed because of logistical and cost issues he said we and related are working hard to improve both of those mr washington 's unwillingness to free up empowerment zone money for the supermarket has put him at odds with city housing officials since 1994 the city has built 2129 units of housing in the bradhurst area carol abrams a spokeswoman for the city 's department of housing preservation and development said the supermarket was key to her agency 's plan to provide a full service community where residents can live shop and work we 'd very much like the empowerment zone to participate but we 're committed to the bradhurst project she said we 're not going to abandon it we 're committed to finding funding elsewhere bruce a beal a senior vice president of related said his company was also determined to build a supermarket it will be the spark that will help everything around it he said and show that development in this neighborhood is feasible and hopefully encourage other developers to follow
