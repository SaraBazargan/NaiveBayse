to the editor as a newly pregnant woman researching birth options i 'm petrified of turning myself and my baby over to the obstetrics system available in the united states opting to go it alone especially unnerving are the interventions like caesarean section induction episiotomy and other routine procedures that increase the odds of more interventions and deprive the mother of her central role though i will deliver my first child with a certified nurse midwife i support and encourage any woman who seeks to take responsibility for her body and birth no one denies that birth can sometimes be unpredictable and complicated and such situations greatly benefit from medical intervention but we 've been manipulated to accept the ridiculous premise that women are incapable of giving birth without medical intervention victoria p krimm chicago
