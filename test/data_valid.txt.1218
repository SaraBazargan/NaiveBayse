while they will be watching closely on monday night people in new hampshire like to claim that the results in iowa will not affect their primary eight days later but the results are bound to and the most intriguing possibility is that a bad loss by former senator bill bradley in iowa 's democratic race could shift some independents to senator john mccain boosting his chances in the republican contest here right now the polls here suggest mr mccain running even with gov george w bush of texas and mr bradley even with vice president al gore parochial pride is at work in denying iowa 's influence a retired supermarket bookkeeper here said the only thing i know about iowa is that they grow tall corn and big pigs there of course nobody doubts that if iowa also produces big victories for mr bush and mr gore their backers will be energized by hopes that another victory in a row would mortally wound their rivals but no one counts on that energy as sufficient this is a contrarian state and no one since jimmy carter in 1980 has won a contested new hampshire primary after winning a contested iowa caucus governor bush 's father george hw bush won in iowa that year and insisted that momentum which he called the big mo would win for him here ronald reagan beat him this is how the bradley to mccain bounce could work thirty seven percent of the state 's registered voters have not declared for either the democratic or republican party on feb 1 they are free to request a ballot in either party 's primary since both mr bradley and mr mccain have appealed strongly to independent voters with campaign finance proposals and general anti establishment stance a loss by mr bradley in iowa could persuade some who had been inclined toward him to come down for mr mccain instead some voters here admit that mrs anna l albanese of hooksett said this morning that she liked mr mccain and mr bradley because they sound more sincere and they both have experience she said that she was counting on the people of iowa to help me decide and that a weak finish there by mr bradley would turn her toward mr mccain the arizona senator the only candidate in this state today is not counting on that happening widely he believes new hampshire 's undeclared voters still have strong partisan or philosophical views a liberal leaning person would have difficulty voting for me he told reporters in salem mark longabaugh mr bradley 's campaign director here agreed saying the undeclared voters usually stuck with one party he argued that the time bradley had spent establishing himself here had insulated him from such a shift new hampshire will stand on its own mr longabaugh said but j joseph grandmaison a veteran democratic leader here working for mr gore was skeptical about new hampshire 's proud isolationism we 're not on another planet he said a number of undeclared voters want their ballot to have meaning he said and a mccain vote might accomplish that overall the state has 265000 registered republicans 194000 registered democrats and 274000 undeclared voters undeclared voters must say they support the principles of the party whose ballot they ask for but they can reclaim their nonparty status before leaving the polling place in 1996 two thirds switched back to undeclared immediately richard f winters chairman of the political science department at dartmouth argued that people in new hampshire were unusually strategic voters choosing not just with their hearts but their heads despite ideological differences he said both mr bradley and mr mccain came across as the unpartied candidate a shift among undeclared voters might amount to small numbers mr winters said but in new hampshire there are no big numbers
