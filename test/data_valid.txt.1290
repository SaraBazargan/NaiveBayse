to the editor when i was a medical student and not yet licensed to practice medicine in contrast with residents and interns who can we introduced ourselves to patients as students on the team of dr so and so a matter of degrees if surgery was planned the attending surgeon told the patient that we would be part of the team similar procedures were followed after graduation when we were interns and residents i do not recall any instance in which the patient objected to my participation whether as a student or after graduation this system worked for the only valid reason our learning was conditioned upon our participation patients understood the attending physician who used rather than taught the students quickly lost their cooperation and interest the system worked for me for 42 years if medical students and residents are treated as both participants in patient care and as people there to learn and not infrequently to teach their elders the complex process of medical care is made easier for the patient as well as the doctor and the trainees dr robert m richter new york the writer is a retired surgeon
