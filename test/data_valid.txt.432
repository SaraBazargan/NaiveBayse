interests of the region that 's a euphemism for overthrow of government or toppling saddam why then did he not say we intend to throw him and his motley crew of mass murderers out of baghdad replacing them with a government that will allow the iraqi people free elections because that sort of talk is undiplomatic or even impolitic overthrow and topple are hot vigorous verbs regime change is a cool polite noun phrase suggesting transition without collateral damage a regime is a government you do n't like it can also be a strict diet of grapefruit and pasta which you do n't like either but that 's a different sense the old regime is always pejorative coming from the french revolutionaries gleeful derogation of the government of the last bourbon kings as l'ancien regime the word 's coloration is negative no politician seeking a fresh start or a clean sweep goes on to call for a new regime if the case for regime change is clear writes michael eisenstadt in the national interest the way

unintended inadvertent it is in the same league of hesitant regret as friendly fire the phrasedick fred shapiro at yale tracked it back in its current sense to a 1961 usage by thomas schelling in operations research magazine measures to locate and design our strategic forces so as to minimize collateral damage reached at the university of maryland where he is now a distinguished professor schelling says i used it because it seemed to be the common terminology he disclaims coinage of that and of counterforce and second strike also often attributed to him such modesty is rare when i coin something i make sure all the nattering nabobs of negativism know it in running the traps with shapiro 's help at the american dialect society i get word from john baker that collateral damage was
