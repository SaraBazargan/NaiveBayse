sex longing and loss those are the words the composer ricky ian gordon chose to describe the underlying themes of his music in an interview with the playwright richard nelson on sunday evening at the peter b lewis theater in the guggenheim museum but the composer 's self definition which came at the midpoint of a concert of his songs featuring the singers audra mcdonald theresa mccarthy darius de haas and lewis cleale tells only part of the story mr gordon 's settings of langston hughes dorothy parker edna st vincent millay and other poets dance freely across the line between a sophisticated post sondheim broadway style and strait laced art song he writes extremely singer friendly music that conveys the happy sad mood swings of an open hearted child as the singers performed more than 20 of mr gordon 's songs the majority arranged by the composer for a 10 member ensemble conducted by ted sperling the music bubbled and cascaded like a mountain brook after a spring rain over and over one had the image of a boy skipping ecstatically through fields and woods on a crisp april morning mr gordon 's love of poetry is evident from the clarity and ease of flow of settings that rarely allow a word to get lost whether giving musical voice to hughes 's urban angst or to parker 's cynicism the composer instinctively looks for the silver lining he turns despair into sadness and softens bitter into wry several of his settings of hughes 's poems are inflected with jazz age flavors that suggest the blues but as played by a jazz band at a champagne reception on an ocean liner his setting of parker 's red dress about a girl 's yearning for a symbolic gown and the letdown of finally possessing it focuses on the starry eyed girl not the grown up cynic with music added marie howe 's portrait of grief what the living do sung by ms mccarthy with a touching naturalness became a lesson on how to live in the moment the program which was repeated last night was astutely cast mr de haas 's bursting enthusiasm elevated heaven a hughes fantasy of the hereafter into pure euphoria while ms mcdonald in excellent voice beautifully balanced the bleakness and hope of two hughes poems put together poor girls ruination and the dream keeper mr cleale found the heroic heart of we will always walk together a romantic hymn celebrating a friendship that transcends death from the show dream true sex longing and loss yes you could feel them but they were undercurrents in a concert whose overriding mood was one of joy
