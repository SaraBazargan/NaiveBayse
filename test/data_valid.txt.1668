to the editor re rescuing the democrats by david brooks column oct 21 the democrats may be suffering from their own success through the new deal was the great middle class and democratic majority built but this required a period as desperate as the 1930 's then postwar prosperity took hold and the democrats embrace of civil rights broke up the solid south now the misery of the depression the wretched working conditions in a preunionized america and the brutality of racial discrimination have nearly faded from memory and the long slow slide of the democratic party is almost a matter of gravity the next great depression may not be around the corner but eventually the bush administration may succeed in dismantling the reforms on which american workers rose and recreate the conditions in which the democratic party will again prevail larry greenfield los angeles oct 21 2003
