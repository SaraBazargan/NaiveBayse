the winter 's tale was one of shakespeare 's last plays and beginning with the title it overflows with the signals of resignation accrued wisdom and compassion that attend age and experience consider its remarkably forgiving attitude toward its protagonist leontes king of sicilia whose anomalous and tragically misguided fit of jealousy causes the deaths of his wife hermione and their young son mamillius leontes earns redemption with 16 years of penitent grief and the play rewards him by bringing hermione back to life and returning to them their daughter perdita also presumed dead leontes had banished her as an infant imagining her the spawn of hermione 's infidelity the final scene is one of intense emotion the exquisite happiness of family reunion and the lingering throb of loss the 16 flown years are a casualty of spendthrift folly and mamillius is gone forever and so for a blip of misjudgment and cruelty in an otherwise exemplary life leontes who is easy to imagine as in his mid 40 's the age of shakespeare when he wrote the winter 's tale is neither condemned to dismal loneliness nor entirely relieved of his sadness and guilt his plight is a gorgeous fable lump in the throat stuff and it resonates with anyone who has ever contemplated mortality in barry edelstein 's stirring new production of the winter 's tale by the classic stage company the world of the play is contemporary post sept 11 2001 and the idea of going on after a loss after an inexplicable tragic occurrence is paramount as leontes and hermione exit at the play 's end mr edelstein resurrects mamillius as a ghost playing the tinkly toy piano he enjoyed while alive as ethereal a reminder of extinguished life as two shafts of blue light extending into the night sky indeed this sicilia might well be new york city the king 's courtiers and their ladies seem to inhabit the roomy spare downtown lofts of tribeca the theater 's performance space has been largely cleared out to the brick back wall and they face one another slickly groomed and confidently nouveau riche in the manner of high end architects or hip entrepreneurs congratulating themselves on their successes an onstage pianist accompanies the action of the play with original music by michael torke it is contemporary stuff a little jazzy a little dissonant occasionally fit for the kind of cocktail party scene that mr edelstein has staged to open the play more often the score is the moody harbinger heavy punctuation usually associated with a movie it 's is odd but it works leontes is played by david strathairn whose bearing is more introspective than regal with his darting expressively uncertain eyes his unathletic grace and nimbly eloquent diction he brings a particular brand of self questioning and ambivalence to the role that works beautifully in depicting a man whose power has been mocked by uncontrollable circumstance he makes leontes whole showing how delusion anguish and tempered gratitude can be cut from the same mortal cloth mr strathairn 's performance is compelling enough that the production misses him when he 's not around and for a long stretch in the play 's second half when the action shifts across the sea he is n't the setting is bohemia the kingdom of polixenes michel gill leontes 's boyhood friend and the man he has accused of frolicking with his wife one of shakespeare 's themes in the winter 's tale is that what goes around comes around life on earth as relentlessly cyclical and bohemia is sicilia 's complement the other half of the world it is a change of seasons summer to sicilia 's winter comedy to sicilia 's tragedy and in mr edelstein 's vision if sicilia is urban bohemia is rural if sicilia is mr edelstein 's new york bohemia is his petticoat junction complete with haystacks hillbillies in overalls and randy farmers daughters this is not just representative of half the real world but the other half of shakespeare 's dramatic world as well the flip side of hamlet next door neighbor to a midsummer night 's dream this is the place where coincidence reigns where disguises come in handy where yokels are in the majority and con men take advantage of them mr edelstein does an imaginative job of staging the goofy antics with help from a resourceful set design by narelle sissons that relies largely on curtains and pulleys but he is not as skillful with his actors with the exception of tom bloom and david costabile as a rustic farmer and his son the comic acting is on the crude side mr bloom also plays antigonus the doomed sicilian courtier who is consigned to transport the infant perdita and who abandoning her on the bohemian shore exits famously pursued by a bear his dual performance is impressive and entertaining as autolycus the chief rogue teagle f bougere memorable name has plenty of bravado but very little elan and the line readings of the young lovers perdita and florizel elizabeth reaser and gene farber clank with inexperience though ms reaser does have the beauty and bearing of an innocently lusty shakespearean heroine in any case it is a relief dramatically to return to sicilia there the actors are poignantly choreographed by mr edelstein they include mr strathairn ms reaser mary lou rosato who plays hermione 's devoted friend the formidable paulina the child actor michael reid who plays mamillius and barbara garrick whose hermione comes more to life when she wakes from the dead than when she was first alive together they turn the closing scene into the joyous and melancholy tableau that looks to
