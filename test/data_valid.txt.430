a counterpoint to the egregious philip morris report suggesting that the early death of smokers can benefit a nation 's economy is an extensive study by the world bank that details the chilling and very expensive toll that cigarettes are taking around the world according to the report called curbing the epidemic the only two causes of death that are huge and growing worldwide are aids and tobacco related illnesses according to the centers for disease control and prevention tobacco is expected to become the biggest killer in most developing countries within the next 20 years causing more deaths than aids malaria tuberculosis automobile crashes homicides and suicides combined if current patterns hold a half billion people who are alive today will eventually be killed by tobacco more than half of those are now children and teenagers by the year 2030 tobacco is projected to be the single biggest cause of death worldwide accounting for about 10 million deaths per year big tobacco ought to send thank you notes to new moms and new dads around the world because their newborns are absolutely essential to big tobacco 's strategy of addicting ever larger waves of young customers to replace the ever increasing loads of smokers lost to early death the world bank estimates that in affluent countries 14000 to 15000 children and young people take up smoking each day in middle income and low income countries somewhere between 68000 and 84000 take their first insidious puffs the idea that they know what they 're in for that they understand the agony that may well await them years down the road and have made a rational choice to risk it is ludicrous and this is significant when you talk about the economics of smoking according to the world bank study which was done before the recent study commissioned by philip morris it appears that smokers lifetime health care costs in affluent countries are somewhat higher than non smokers despite their shorter lives it is not at all clear what the situation is in less affluent countries with less extensive health care networks but that of course should not be the issue the first issue to be addressed is the non economic value one would hope it would be a high value that we ascribe to human beings based solely on the fact that they exist but even if the discussion is limited to economic matters there is a problem with philip morris 's contention that countries can derive benefits from the early demise of smokers it flies in the face of accepted economic theory which argues that the benefits of a free market flow from rational decisions made by consumers who when spending their money and only their money understand the risks and rewards of the choices they make that is largely not the case with smokers despite all the warnings about the murderous effects of tobacco it seems clear that as the world bank study noted people 's knowledge of the health risks of smoking appears to be partial at best that is especially true with young smokers and smokers in poorer countries where information about the hazards of smoking is limited the study said in china for example 61 percent of adult smokers surveyed in 1996 believed that cigarettes did them 'little or no harm people tend to underestimate the addictive effects of nicotine and grossly underestimate the likelihood that they will contract a horrible disease from smoking moreover the health related costs of smoking both physical and financial are never limited to the smokers themselves was the black death a boon to europe in the middle ages is aids a boon to africa today smoking a boon i do n't think so some years ago i interviewed an anti smoking activist named david goerlitz who had once been known as the winston man because he had appeared in winston ads for the r j reynolds tobacco company he once asked a group of r j reynolds executives if any of them smoked they all said no mr goerlitz said one of the executives shook his head and said are you kidding we reserve that right for the poor the young the black and the stupid not much has changed that philosophy is now being played out on a global scale
