wrath and pain desire and self loathing ferocity and meditation all find a complicated balance in tool which played a two night stand at madison square garden this week avoiding self glorification the band played in near darkness under video screens on monday maynard james keenan tool 's lead singer stood on a platform behind adam jones on guitar and justin chancellor on bass with his face in shadows while danny carey on drums toiled meticulously by his side the video images presented the human body as a nightmare of protoplasm ghostly ravaged or recombined with multiple appendages two dancers scuttled across the stage on all fours climbed ropes or dangled upside down embracing and writhing in a spectacle of burdensome flesh from its beginnings in the early 1990 's tool has been one of the bleakest and most idiosyncratic bands in rock determined to probe the most desperate emotions its songs hammer and seethe melding the lowdown guitars of grunge the odd meters of progressive rock and the whiplash stops and starts of thrash mr keenan 's sustained almost androgynous voice hovers within the music desolate but impervious to the tumult around him perhaps against his will mr keenan has shown 21st century hard rock bands how to update the power ballad and hang tough under a slow moving melody mr keenan 's lyrics seek human connection even in its most debased forms i 'm alive when you 're touching me alive when you 're shoving me down he sang but connections lead to betrayal hypocrisy and a cycle of destruction and self destruction where tool 's 1996 album aenima envisioned apocalypse with bitter satisfaction its current one lateralus zoo entertainment bmg searches for a way out the set opened as the album does with grudge in which the singer urges someone or himself to let go of old wounds and it concluded with the album 's title song in which he seeks to leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical yet while he 's stuck there the band flails magnificently tool 's songs encompassed sullen calm rapid fire onslaughts spacious chords and nimble fingered counterpoint standing room sometimes became a mosh pit but midway through its two hour set tool chose stasis with a patiently tolling guitar vamp like a mantra its fastest music also had a ritual quality pounding and repeating like drummers in a trance ceremony songs that rev up and end abruptly on tool 's albums only accelerated further riffing harder and harder as if through furious motion they could somehow break through tool 's perpetual tension to reach a long denied release
