what 's your connection with santo domingo my recent experience with cellphone cloning began with that question posed in a crisp midwestern accent by a sprint pcs representative in kansas city mo i fished around in my head for any link i might have to the capital of the dominican republic i do n't have one i replied it turned out that someone with relatively simple scanning equipment had plucked the electronic serial number of my cellphone from the airwaves and in the space of three days racked up 13681 in charges billed to my phone number almost all of the calls were to santo domingo sprint pcs used software that flags spikes in calling volume to determine that my cellphone had been cloned i learned a lot about cloning in the weeks that ensued as i tried to clear up the problem the first was that cellphone cloning contrary to what many people assume is far from dead i had been under the assumption that cloning had largely disappeared with the expansion of digital wireless networks in the 1990 's unlike older analog systems that do not fully use the radio signals transmitted between handsets and the wider network digital networks convert voice conversations into series of ones and zeros this compression which allows as many as 10 digital calls to occupy the space of a single analog call makes it more difficult to scan the airwaves in the effort to extract a cellphone 's serial number the most important cloning step this is the main reason the golden age of cellphone cloning the late 1980 's is behind us little did i know however that the achilles heel of today 's digital wireless networks is their dependence on older analog systems carriers often shift users to analog parts of their network when their base stations are overloaded with calls or transfer users to other companies analog networks a process that kicks in roaming fees it is when this switch occurs that almost all cloning now takes place said mark guidry whose houston company the guidry group advises companies on ways to prevent cloning and other types of fraud it takes about 30 seconds to clone a phone with black boxes the scanning equipment normally used to alter or modify the electronic serial number of a mobile phone the cellular telephone protection act which became law in april 1998 makes it a crime to buy or sell black boxes without authorization still analysts say such equipment can illegally be acquired for as little as 2000 although estimates vary about one half of 1 percent of wireless customers in the united states have their cellphones cloned each year compared with 4 percent in the late 1980 's before digital networks began to expand according to sprint pcs fewer than 10000 of its 144 million customers had their handsets cloned last year you were among the unlucky few dan wilinsky a sprint pcs spokesman told me after sprint pcs discovered the cloning it promptly told me i would not be charged for the fraudulent calls but i had to insist on a credit for the new york taxes on roaming calls which amounted to 3572 there was also confusion over what to do with my mobile phone number after the incident at first sprint pcs told me i would have to choose a new number because my old one and my handset would have to be retired after i prodded for an explanation i was told i really did not have to cancel my number although it is a quick way to fix the problem by ensuring that the number can not be used to make cloned calls again but i did have to get a new handset after my samsung phone 's identification number was compromised sprint pcs provides customers whose phones are cloned with a free replacement concerned by the possibility that it could happen again though i chose a different phone a smaller motorola handset that operates only on digital networks
