in anticipation of the 2001 summit of the americas commencing this friday in quebec city heads of state from the 34 member nations have no doubt done their fair share of homework but not as much it 's safe to say as the thousands of activists who hope to turn the event into the same kind of mass protest staged in seattle in 1999 and in prague in 2000 the summit 's delegates will negotiate the free trade area of the americas ftaa accord which critics have dubbed nafta on steroids no one 's willing to predict just how many activists will converge on the francophone city but through the movement 's now familiar mix of tactics borrowed from punk rock 1930 's spanish anarchism new age feminism nonviolent resistance environmental activism and rave culture organizers managed to get their message heard across the continent and around the world they plan to stage a carnival against capitalism in the city itself and various disruptions along the us canada border more modest actions are planned at the san diego tijuana crossing as well as in some 60 other cities from thunder bay ontario to buenos aires whether they pull it off remains to be seen as does the extent to which the police will be able to anticipate and contain these actions but the behind the scenes work has been an impressive case study in post seattle organizing as with many such actions the first step is a call a call to action from a local group defining the political principles and goals of the event in this case since the factions could not agree on whether property destruction violates the movement 's semiofficial code of nonviolence there were two competing calls one from the anti capitalist convergence known as clac its initials in french and a quebec city group called casa the other by an economic justice organization called operation salami dirty friend the calls went up on e mail lists devoted to topics like anarchism free trade issues and labor organizing subscribers reposted them on gay lesbian feminist green student activist indigenous rights and police and prisons lists among others within a few days the potential audience had grown from a few dozen people to tens of thousands the next step was the forming of affinity groups small cells that will look out for one another one affinity group from vermont protesting the privatization of water rights plans to dress in blue and perform pagan rituals with pitchers of water from all over the americas meanwhile representatives from clac casa and salami started out across canada and america educating these groups in tactics from forming human blockades to practicing inclusive consensus based decision making and of course dealing with the media the independent media center which functions as the movement 's semiofficial news service will be operating a web site uploading real time street reports from quebec city in late march about 200 representatives of the affinity groups attended a planning session in quebec city they agreed to divide protests into three ways of being strictly legal peaceful but possibly illegal and the euphemistic diversity of tactics a category that may include property destruction or clashes with the police the final details will be worked out at a convergence after everyone has arrived convergences tend to bog down as delegates are empowered to vote on only those decisions their affinity groups have already made which means many trips back and forth to discuss new proposals local organizers received more than 15000 requests for sleeping arrangements some of which will be filled on floors and couches of sympathetic quebecers whatever happens at the protests themselves the people involved say that participating is a statement in itself this did n't start in seattle says jaggi singh a clac member and it sure is n't going to stop in quebec city
