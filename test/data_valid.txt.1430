in the explosion of creativity that transformed russian art in the early 20th century only a handful of painters chagall kandinsky malevich tatlin and el lissitzky among them gained world renown before the soviet union clamped down on modern art and imposed the creed of socialist realism yet when jean louis prat the director of the fondation maeght began to prepare a show on the era 's two major abstract movements suprematism and constructivism he was taken aback during visits to moscow and st petersburg last year he discovered many unknown or forgotten artists whose work was kept from public view in the basements of government museums from the 1930 's until the demise of the soviet union in 1991 so he rethought his exhibition as a result with 150 works by 48 artists representing a half dozen often competing movements russia and its avant gardes now offers a rare overview of the intense period between 1908 and 1928 when russian and then soviet artists revolutionized modern art the russian curators who came for the opening were impressed because they had never seen all these works together mr prat said the show on display at the foundation 's hilltop museum here through nov 5 is indeed startling the provencal light works its magic showing colors at their richest even with kasimir malevich 's suprematist masterpiece black square on white but still more striking is the extraordinary energy and daring of russian avant gardes that seemed to appear from nowhere and barely two decades later disappeared just as swiftly here individual movements can be seen as part of a far broader drive to create an entirely new visual language one that led artists constantly to experiment the show exposes the nonconformism of a society that looked conformist mr prat said artists were inventing an art of total freedom conceived before the 1917 revolution by people who did n't know they were carrying out a revolution they had freedom before the revolution one sign was the large number of artists who were women in st petersburg moscow and vitebsk prominent among them were natalia goncharova olga rozanova liubov popova alexandra exter varvara stepanova and nadezhda udaltsova who are in this show and were also featured in amazons of the avant garde at the guggenheim museum berlin in 1999 and later in new york several were married to other artists adding to the notion of one large family at work still the initial inspiration came from abroad in the first years of the century russian artists went to paris to discover not only the post impressionism of cezanne gauguin and van gogh and the fauvism of matisse derain and de vlaminck but also the cubist watershed of picasso and braque and thanks to the great russian collectors ivan morozov and sergei shchukin works by many of them could also be seen in moscow italian futurism with its emphasis on speed and power also influenced some russian artists they in turn adapted it to create what became known as cubo futurism a movement still linked to figuration that also sought to embrace the dynamism of a new machine driven industrial society coincidentally russian artists were tapping their own roots in art known as neo primitivism which used the symbols and colors of russian rural life mikhail larionov and goncharova who like many of their colleagues had practiced both cubo futurism and neo primitivism led an ephemeral movement called rayonism an attempt to deconstruct light we perceive a sum of rays proceeding from a source of light larionov wrote in 1913 these are reflected from the object and enter our field of vision consequently if we wish to paint literally what we see then we must paint the sum of rays reflected from the object with works illustrating these overlapping movements the first galleries at the fondation maeght gradually prepare visitors for the great breakthrough to abstraction in suprematism and constructivism suprematism is inseparable from malevich who in 1915 presented the results of his research into nonobjective representation some 40 works of pure abstraction termed supreme in the sense of total with no reference to anything realistic of black square on white which is displayed here alongside black cross and black circle malevich wrote that the black square represented feeling and the white background the void beyond this feeling this show offers a score of works by malevich and his followers distinguished by floating squares rectangles circles half moons triangles and lines suprematism is the rediscovery of pure art malevich wrote yet when artists tried to apply it to architecture it proved too rigid instead having exhausted its possibilities suprematism was superseded by constructivism this movement originally called the productivist school had a more lasting impact not only adapting itself to the needs of the soviet revolution but also making its influence felt on germany 's bauhaus movement and the dutch de stijl artists as well as on english sculptors like barbara hepworth and henry moore like suprematism constructivism was abstract but it sought to construct art through what it called real materials collages reliefs or sculptures made of wood metal paper paint and glass in real space that is three dimensionally by the mid 1920 's however with chagall and kandinsky among a growing number of artists choosing exile realistic elements began to reappear in russian art in 1925 kliment redko a former suprematist painted insurrection a geometric landscape with lenin at the center two years later alexander deineka 's textile workers while avant garde in its execution nonetheless carried a political message perhaps most significantly by the end of the decade with lenin dead and stalin in power malevich himself had returned to a form of figuration although applying some of the techniques of suprematism to portraits of peasants including head of peasant with black beard in which the face is a featureless white oval but the short life of the russian avant garde was ending in 1932 smothering the notion of artistic freedom stalin banned informal groups or movements of artists and required everyone to join the communist run union of artists the role of artists was no longer to explore ideas but to reproduce socialist realism many artists conformed and survived malevich died in poverty in st petersburg renamed leningrad in 1935 by then he had become a nonperson correction august 5 2003 tuesday a picture caption in arts ideas on saturday about an exhibit of early russian avant garde art in st paul de
