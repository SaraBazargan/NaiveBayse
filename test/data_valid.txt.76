as they opened their four day festival of benevolence in philadelphia republicans of all stripes seemed convinced that gov george w bush 's election was a sure thing in november yet the best possible reminder of the perils of optimism lay only a couple miles west of the first union center at an abandoned convention hall on the other side of the schuylkill river it was there in philadelphia 's massive old municipal auditorium that gov thomas e dewey of new york captured the 1948 republican presidential nomination with similarly high expectations indeed meyer berger reported in the times that the delegates were attending the richest the noisiest the most exuberant quadrennial republican meeting since losing the white house to franklin d roosevelt in 1932 by contrast a month later in the same auditorium president harry truman was given the democratic nomination at a convention that mr berger likened to a wake the stifling heat did more than wilt emotions when some doves of peace hidden inside a flowered liberty bell were released to signal truman 's arrival several turned out to have died while others menaced the delegates as chairman sam rayburn shouted over the radio get those expletive pigeons out of here it was considered just another bad omen for the party for 52 years of course every underdog presidential candidate has compared himself to truman who defied expectations and won in november but since 1948 was the last time philadelphia played host to a national convention indeed three national conventions including that of the progressive party of henry wallace echoes from that year seem particularly acute this year according to a new book the last campaign how harry truman won the 1948 election philadelphia was chosen as the convention site because it sat in the center of a coaxial transmission belt enabling television to be transmitted to 500000 sets from richmond to boston in all writes the author zachary karabell 10 million viewers watched the conventions in the new medium democrats learned from mistakes by the republicans and shortened their proceedings for viewers launching a trend culminating in both parties tailoring their entire conventions for an audience that still may reach 100 million this year the substance also reflects how much and how little has changed in 52 years dewey 's capture of the republican nomination came at the height of the hegemony of the party 's so called liberal eastern establishment by the 1960 's control of the party shifted south along with the bush family george bush moved to texas out of the shadow of his father senator prescott bush of connecticut but he was always seen as a son of that establishment now governor bush like his father proclaims himself a man of the sunbelt but acts like an internationalist in the dewey eisenhower tradition despite the pigeon problem truman went on to give a great acceptance speech in philadelphia that launched his historic come from behind victory what is striking about it is how little the issues have changed truman outlined them as social security education health the minimum wage and avoiding tax cuts for the rich in order to pay down the national debt the truman style will be hard to replicate however like vice president al gore in this year 's campaign truman bragged endlessly on how prosperous farmers and workers had become under the democrats but somehow it is hard to imagine mr gore issuing truman 's salty warning to both that they are the most ungrateful people in the world if they pass the democratic party by this year at the end of their sweltering convention drenched and wilted republicans left town convinced they had a winner but feeling somehow uninspired dewey said the nation magazine was the nominee nobody loves this year judging from the reaction of delegates in philadelphia that is one thing that is strikingly different but of course governor bush is beloved most of all because he looks like a sure winner from the delegates perspective the presumptive nominee 's strategy of staging a streamlined convention with plenty of uplifting talk and pictures of a more diverse republican party looks like a winner too but in the padlocked auditorium across the river there may be a few ghosts who remember the lesson of 1948 dewey regarded the convention as the culmination of his effort rather than as a mere beginning leaving himself vulnerable to a pugnacious democrat who refused to believe the polls
