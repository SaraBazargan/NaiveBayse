few depictions of lovemaking on a new york stage have been more sensual than the brief impassioned encounter between two fully clothed concert singers underneath a dimly lighted grand piano that is the climactic scene of the director deborah warner 's intriguing production of janacek 's diary of one who vanished at the john jay college theater janacek 's 40 minute song cycle from 1916 cries out for the kind of spare and simple operatic staging that ms warner has given it while not effective in every detail this is a compelling dramatic presentation of the composer 's searching and vaguely autobiographical work as well as a bracing challenge to the protocol of the song recital itself the czech text 22 poems by ozef kalda has been rendered by the nobel prize winning poet seamus heaney into pungent english verse that captures the rustic elegance of janacek 's music the protagonist is a rustic and virginal moravian plowboy named janek who is at first distressed by his overpowering attraction to a young gypsy until he loses himself in his passion and deserts his highland village for a nomadic existence and the promise of sensual fulfillment with her the production which opened thursday night in its north american premiere movingly utilizes the talents of two courageous british singers the tenor ian bostridge as the fair haired janek and the mezzo soprano ruby philogene as the sultry gypsy in one of ms warner 's striking touches mr bostridge is already lying under the piano as the audience enters the theater it 's as if the young man groggy and exhausted is at once recovering from and preparing to recount his tumultuous romance while mr bostridge in tuxedo pants an open collared dress shirt and suspenders shifts restlessly on the stage floor the pianist julius drake in stocking feet and slouching over the keyboard distractedly plays disconnected strands of the score in anticipation of the wrenching story to come as the first section of the work begins we see projected video images of the young man against the bare backdrop by the set designers jean kalman and tom pye then mr bostridge as janek blindfolded and flailing about the stage begins to sing of his unsettling attraction to the young gypsy the songs which are continuously linked combine a rough hewn lyricism with janacek 's distinctively spiky and untethered harmonic language mr bostridge who at 36 still looks like the lanky bookish postdoctoral history fellow he was not long ago brings a boyish intensity to his portrayal the focused purity and poignant warmth of his sound are ideal for this music that said he was a latecomer to professional singing and his technique is not entirely reliable and surprisingly for a singer who brings uncommon intelligence and literacy to his artistry his diction was not always clear you want to hear every word of mr heaney 's verse like top it up my oxen team  and plough it straight and take the strain which janek sings in the crackling beginning of the sixth song still mr bostridge holds back nothing in this emotionally vulnerable performance especially as the rich voiced and alluring ms philogene enters the scene and offers to let him see the parts of her skin that the the sunlight 's never seen shoeless wearing jeans and a black t shirt ms philogene portrayed an earthy young woman who is as comfortable in her lithe body as janek is pent up in his the impact of the lovemaking scene comes as much from mr drake 's frenzied playing of janacek 's turbulent music in effect an impassioned song for piano as it does from the writhing of the singers mr drake 's playing throughout was subtle and organic impetuous and inexorable moreover he played this complex and harmonically elusive score from memory marion beckenstein margery daley and phyllis fay marmer were the offstage chorus in two crucial dramatic moments in this short work even with the prolonged ovation the entire event was over in 50 minutes but it 's hard to imagine that anyone left the theater feeling shortchanged the final performance is tonight
