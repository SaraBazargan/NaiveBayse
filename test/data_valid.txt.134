stelios haji ioannou is the first to admit that he likes the finer things in life my ideal hangout would be a gentleman 's club he said laughing during a 70 breakfast for two here at the one aldwych hotel where he stays when he is not home in his monaco penthouse i 'm not the typical person like my customers i come from a wealthy family indeed mr haji ioannou pronounced ha ji oh ahn oo is very rich but he also happens to be the founder of the easygroup a feisty london company that has spawned a bevy of brands here representing all things on the cheap there is easyjet his first creation which in europe mimics southwest airlines the rollicking low cost carrier in the united states then there is easyeverything a chain of huge internet cafes most in britain but spreading across europe that each boast upward of 500 computer terminals offering cheap internet access he has just announced that he will take the concept stateside to times square this fall and then there is his latest idea easyrentacar taking the low cost concept to car rental in europe a web site called easycom intended to be a discount portal for his own and other companies is also in the works the son of a greek shipping tycoon mr haji ioannou 33 and single i never have time i 'm always working did not exactly have it difficult so how does such a loaded man relate to his budget conscious customers it 's difficult when you have so much money he lamented in fact he comes across less as a pampered heir than as an ambitious but irreverent man on the move mr haji ioannou has steadily evolved into a greek version of sir richard branson the virgin group founder championing consumer rights as an underdog fighting the establishment both have the same favorite corporate pinata british airways when british airways started its own low cost carrier go airlines two years ago mr haji ioannou went to court seeking without success to ground it he contended that british airways was unfairly using market dominance to pressure airlines like his like sir richard who painted no way ba aa on the tail fins of his planes to protest british airways proposed alliance with american airlines mr haji ioannou has found offbeat ways to needle his rival on the home page of easyjet 's web site he challenges customers to guess how much money ba 's low cost clone has lost this year and win a pair of free flights also like sir richard mr haji ioannou has become a celebrity of sorts here appearing regularly on television and staging elaborate publicity stunts on the day go started flying for example mr haji ioannou and his colleagues booked tickets on the inaugural flight wearing easyjet shirts in the company 's customary bright orange and handed out free plane tickets for his airline to other passengers while mr haji ioannou may not need to count pennies or even have his businesses turn a profit he says easyjet is profitable he is planning an initial public offering in london this july in his latest published financial statements for the year ended september 1998 easyjet flew 17 million passengers and earned 35 million the airline has recently added 15 planes to its fleet for a total of 33 mr haji ioannou confirmed that his other businesses have yet to show that they can become profitable saying that for now he was spending heavily to expand them but his management style is clearly not about the dowdy details like making money you do n't need to be hands on he said the reason he expanded his empire he added is that in the airline business i was delegating myself out of a job i was more interested in starting companies and the concept than being hands on he said mr haji ioannou was n't always on the maverick entrepreneur path i was meant to be a successor to my father he said explaining that he became interested in business as a child as soon as i stopped believing i could be a footballer or soccer player in british terms after graduating from the london school of economics in 1987 he returned to athens to work for his father 's company troodos shipping unfortunately his father 's business was as he put it a one man show and he was not that man so he persuaded his father to let him start his own shipping company in 1992 this was considered major rebellion he said that company stelmar tankers of athens which is still in business soon became successful and he began looking for other investment opportunities during a visit to the united states in 1994 he took a flight on southwest airlines and became hooked i used to always travel business class he said but i contracted the aviation bug it was totally irrational his father lent him the 75 million he needed to start easyjet in 1995 his older brother polys and his younger sister clelia also have stakes mr haji ioannou almost single handedly created the budget airline niche within britain by resorting to out of the way airports like luton outside london and offering fewer amenities than even southwest now he has set his sights on the internet where he got a taste of its potency by selling easyjet tickets originally he wanted to create a pure dot com but concluded i could n't get myself around a completely virtual business so he resorted to building a gigantic new breed of internet cafe with easyeverything set to cross the atlantic this fall mr haji ioannou and new york will get their first real tastes of each other but then he has been traveling there for decades business class though no longer on british airways
