seeking to clarify his stance on tax cuts speaker j dennis hastert said today he supported president elect george w bush 's across the board tax cut but would prefer to start by passing smaller cuts piecemeal on the house floor mr hastert insisted in a statement today that he is in lock step with mr bush on tax policy but that the political reality of a narrowly divided house led him to prefer winning approval for smaller tax cuts one at a time starting with two bills that have drawn bipartisan support one cutting taxes for some married couples and the other repealing the federal tax on estates that approach is also supported by representative tom delay the majority whip from texas and a hard line conservative i support across the board tax relief because i believe it is one of the fairest ways to cut taxes mr hastert said i also believe that across the board tax relief may help the economy avoid a recession because we had such success in passing bipartisan measures to end the marriage penalty and the death tax in this session of congress i believe that these two bills could quickly be enacted in the law at the beginning of next year mr hastert added that is why i advocate that we start with these two bills in the 107th congress president elect bush reiterated today his desire to see his 13 trillion tax package clear congress and become law and expressed optimism that that would occur i have n't had a chance to talk to the speaker yet mr bush said at a news conference today but what i found to be positive is the speaker was recognizing that we need some tax relief and i have made it clear to the speaker once before that you know i campaigned on a package that i thought was fair and fiscally sound and responsible and i strongly believe that mr hastert 's press secretary john p feehery said there was some miscommunication on thursday at mr hastert 's news conference on thursday mr hastert was asked whether he would seek passage of an across the board tax cut like the one mr bush has advocated or stick to smaller pieces of the overall proposal he said he favored dealing with the tax package in smaller pieces a remark that was taken as an effort to distance himself from mr bush 's plan ari fleischer mr bush 's press secretary said he called mr hastert 's staff this morning to ask about news reports on mr hastert 's remarks representative roy blunt the missouri republican who spearheads mr bush 's house liaison team said mr hastert 's approach to tax cuts is best we can pass anything in his tax package as long as we pass it as a stand alone item mr blunt said as you begin to package those together it becomes more difficult
