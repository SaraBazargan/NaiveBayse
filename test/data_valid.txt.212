five years ago when oprah winfrey had not yet come knocking the novelist jonathan franzen wrote an essay for harper 's magazine called perchance to dream the most illuminating passage is one in which he imagines how he would respond to a hometown st louis audience after the publication of his first novel the twenty seventh city mr franzen does what just about every writer does when his book is about to come out he pictures himself as the hero of an urbane conversation that manages to soothe irate readers charm the intelligentsia and win the praise of nearly everyone himself included then mr franzen invites us to imagine his surprise when reality lets him down and even he has trouble liking himself some fragments of that fantasy must have been kicking around mr franzen 's skull last week when he expressed reservations about his new novel the corrections being chosen by oprah winfrey for her book club a selection that usually guarantees several hundred thousand hardcover sales mr franzen prefers success only on his terms perchance to dream was a painful slalom through the self created obstacles in one writer 's life all of which added up to mr franzen 's regret at having no impact on society at large one of the best ways to have an impact of course is to sell your big novel the one that 's supposed to restore faith in the novel itself to the broadest possible public which is exactly what ms winfrey has generously offered the reasons for mr franzen 's demurral are two being selected for ms winfrey 's book club might detract from his self anointed membership in what he calls the high art literary tradition a phrase he 'll be ironically linked with forever he also quibbled that some copies of his book would appear with the oprah 's book club seal on the dust jacket potentially causing a crisis among people who buy books mainly to advertise their intellectual independence mr franzen 's remarks suggest that what really irked him was the fact that this was his moment his book his dust jacket and hilariously that ms winfrey was somehow getting a free ride on his gravy train lurking behind mr franzen 's rejection of ms winfrey is an elemental distrust of readers except for the ones he designates in fact what marks mr franzen as a commentator on his own career as opposed to the excellent novelist he can sometimes be is a desire to play all the parts in the cycle of literary production and consumption himself in those imaginary conversations described in perchance to dream he was the radio host the irate phone in caller the critic each of them soothed by the eloquence of the young author in a sense mr franzen is still living in the same solipsistic dream world ms winfrey 's mistake was to ask to cut in in that five year old essay mr franzen quotes a personal letter from don delillo a response that lets us guess what kind of letter mr delillo was answering his words are full of good sense the novel he tells mr franzen is whatever novelists are doing at a given time in other words kid shut up and write public exquisite self damning self torture may be part of the creative process for mr franzen but that should n't deter him from appearing on oprah during a recent interview in esquire mr franzen told the critic sven birkerts for better or worse i 'm an emotions guy with an ellipsis like that mr franzen would be a natural on daytime talk
