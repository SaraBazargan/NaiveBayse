the cold and rainy weekends of early summer gave me a short reprieve from appearing in public in a bathing suit but now it 's hot and i 've made a much dreaded visit to a department store without glancing at the racks of two piece suits their skimpiness is another topic i headed straight for the one piece dark colored suits which i 've always been told are far more camouflaging i then made my way to the dressing room where i came face to face with the one item of home decor that i have assiduously avoided in my decorating and redecorating forays the full length mirror i suddenly had a flashback to a few years ago when my daughter lucie who was then 9 and i checked into the delano hotel on miami beach for a short weekend even at that age she was a fan of philippe starck 's designs as was i having visited two other modern hotels with the starck touch the paramount in new york and the mondrian in los angeles we knew we would feel right at home at the delano as soon as we walked into our small room with its partial ocean view we marveled at the all white accouterments the bed with its snowy duvet and pillows the upholstered chair the shiny vinyl covered floor the oh so trendy at that time anyway pedestal sink the towels hung so cleverly on a leaning ladder rack later that evening a cloud as they say appeared on my horizon getting undressed i could not help but get a full frontal view of myself in the mirror more than full length it covered one of the walls facing the bed floor to ceiling and was horrified at how every flaw every pound every crease seemed magnified in the all white environment that memory has proven to be the most inspirational in my weight loss department but it has not prompted me to mend my ways at home or at my country house on the weekend as far as mirrors are concerned until now i have been seriously thinking about getting a truly full length mirror for my prewar manhattan apartment where the only large mirrors are the kind that hang on bathroom doors and do not show the whole picture the door does not open far enough and anyway the lighting is only slightly more forgiving than a body covering muumuu would be i 'd also like to get one for the country house where the bathroom mirrors are above the sink and the only other mirror designed by jeff koons is shaped like a flower walking into that bathroom one gets a pretty good albeit disjointed reflection of oneself i have decided that seeing myself more clearly might help my body image although i 'm not ready to mirror any wall completely to achieve this goal hearing my predicament my friend jane simply handed me the design within reach catalog the freestanding vela mirror by pablo pardo at 55 inches fits the bill she said so does the appropriately described generously proportioned nantucket mirror from pottery barn it is available in two sizes 36 by 66 inches or 30 by 42 inches and can be hung or leaned vertically or horizontally but that would defeat my purpose for sure i 'm still hesitating i think of the 1930 work by rene magritte titled the eternal evidence which i saw in the recent surrealism desire unbound exhibition at the metropolitan museum of art the female body is depicted in five canvases each one focusing on a single part of the body that might be a more soothing option for me so now i 'm poised to order a series of small mirrors and hang them strategically along one wall at different heights conveniently pottery barn has such a selection in oval square and rectangular shapes including unframed beveled mirrors and ones with molded silver frames that will allow me not only to create a decorative effect but also to have an excuse to work on only one of my body parts at a time sources 'who 's the fairest oh never mind the freestanding angled vela mirror designed by pablo pardo in stainless steel and glass is available in a floor version 12 inches wide by 55 inches high for 220 and a table version 7 inches wide by 18 inches high for 100 from design within reach wwwdwrcom 800 944 2233 grouping mirrors of different shapes and sizes on one wall can provide an interesting effect and surreal reflections pottery barn has a selection of small mirrors that can be grouped decoratively included are unframed beveled mirrors that can be hung with ribbon or chains they range in price from 69 to 99 apiece the nantucket mirror with a distressed wood frame is available in three sizes the large mirror is 36 inches wide by 66 inches high and costs 399 the medium sized mirror is 30 inches wide and 42 inches high and costs 299 there 's also a small mirror 22 inches wide by 26 inches long that is 199 all are from pottery barn www potterybarncom 800 922 5507
