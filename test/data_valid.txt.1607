there were a lot of things rondell white missed this winter he missed bowling with his brother floyd he missed his mother essie 's home cooked meals he missed the house he shares with floyd on creekside drive in gray ga and the comfort of knowing his parents are on the 14 acres he bought for them next door we missed him floyd white sr rondell 's father said we knew it was for a good cause though rondell white 's career has been defined by what he has missed white the yankees new left fielder has been on the disabled list eight times in the past six seasons he can not guarantee he will be healthy this season but he is sure he could not be more prepared white spent the winter in sacramento training with al biancani the strength and conditioning coach for the sacramento kings white who was a free agent left the chicago cubs to take the yankees two year 10 million offer but he wanted to change more than just his team he wanted to bury his reputation as a good player who is always hurt he wants to be an elite player and to achieve that he needs to be healthy i got tired of breaking down white said you 've only got so much time to play this game and i just want to be one of the best players i think if i stay on the field i can be ok those who know white say he can be more than ok his father believes he can hit 30 homers and drive in 90 runs his brother thinks he can hit 35 homers and drive in 100 runs then there is f p santangelo the veteran utility player who is a nonroster invitee here at the yankees camp santangelo considers white his former roommate with the montreal expos to be his best friend in baseball he also considers him a star in waiting santangelo lives near sacramento and saw white frequently this winter one day they went to a casino in lake tahoe nev played blackjack and stayed out late in a cafe at 2 am santangelo challenged white people know you are a good player santangelo told white now you have to be great do n't be satisfied with a 2 for 4 go 3 for 4 santangelo said he told white step up you can be a guy who hits 40 home runs and drives in 130 runs you can hit 300 in your sleep hit 320 hit 330 push yourself santangelo had always wanted to say this to white but he picked that moment he said because white had shown he was serious about his career by leaving home to train in california i used to be a little shy for success said white a 295 career hitter i 've always wanted to do well but i did n't want all the attention that came with it i 'm not saying i would slack up but now i want to be great he said that to me and it really hit home i 've always been laid back and low key he was like 'come on man you can be great that 's something to strive for i 'm not shy anymore like i used to be i 'm not outspoken either but i want to be remembered when i leave the game white who turns 30 on saturday was once hesitant to play organized baseball when he was a child the little league had just been established in his town thinking that the players tight uniform pants looked silly white stayed away until he was 11 playing his own games with his brother and two friends they would play beside the family 's mobile home scrunching a piece of tin foil into a ball and using cans and trees for bases but white and his brother finally relented and joined the little league and they soon became local legends white missed his freshman season at jones high school because he broke his leg playing basketball that was the start of some bad luck he said but he helped lead jones to the state championship as a junior he was the expos first round pick in 1990 and reached the majors three years later since 1996 white has been on the disabled list every season except one in 1997 when he hit 270 with 28 homers and 82 runs batted in in the years since white has broken a finger while trying to make a catch had hamstring and groin problems and dislocated a shoulder by sliding headfirst his knees were also weakened by playing on montreal 's harsh artificial surface and he once bruised his kidney and spleen making a catch the yankees considered the circumstances and do not think that white who is 6 feet 1 and 225 pounds will be chronically injured when you look behind the scenes at how he 's gotten hurt it 's not like he 's a china doll general manager brian cashman said that at least made us more comfortable still white wanted to do as much as he could to reduce the chance of injury biancani his trainer put him on a wide ranging six day a week program that improved the strength in his knees and lower body as well as his flexibility and explosiveness the only rest during the workouts white said was when he walked from one machine to another biancani gave white high marks he did an outstanding outstanding job biancani said if i had to give him a grade he 'd get an a plus you 've got to realize i 'm really a hard nosed guy but that 's what it takes to be an elite athlete you 've got to discipline yourself the results have been obvious to white 's family he just loves what it 's done for him his brother floyd said i 've seen times when he was limping and he did n't want to walk up the stairs but right now he 's probably in the best condition i 've seen in a long time santangelo said the workouts seem to have convinced white that he is ready to make the most of his talents all that is left is to become a star and white is no longer too shy for success when i retire i can say i played with clemens and giambi white said hopefully one of these days guys can say they played with rondell too inside pitch the former yankee don mattingly a guest instructor injured his back during a drill on thursday and was admitted to a tampa hospital for tests you 'd like to get to this place in life and think spring training would be fun manager joe torre said it stopped being fun for him this morning infielder enrique wilson reported to camp thursday wilson is 28 years old and because the yankees thought he was 26 when he signed his one year 720000 contract general manager brian cashman said the team had certain rights regarding the contract but wilson 's agent paul kinzer said the yankees had expressed no desire to change or void the deal the yankees officially signed the left hander allen watson to a minor league contract
