the devils started the stanley cup playoffs in an almost ideal manner by scoring two goals on their first four shots when they built a three goal lead later in the first period it looked as if they would treat their fans to a lopsided victory but the intensity the devils employed in the early stages evaporated and they barely held on for a 4 3 victory over the florida panthers tonight at continental arena we got a little too protective of our lead as the game went on coach larry robinson said our biggest problem was too much circling in our zone and we had a problem when we started running around even though the devils did not look convincing the victory put them on the right track toward reversing their recent history of early playoff exits but only 15024 fans 4016 short of a sellout saw the devils take a 1 0 lead in the four of seven game series talk to me after we win four games said bobby holik mindful of the devils early eliminations in the playoffs the last three years this is just one game said holik who had two assists and played a strong all around game the devils succeeded in limiting pavel bure the league 's leading goal scorer with 58 to just an assist bure had only one shot on goal in the almost 19 minutes of action to neutralize bure the devils relied mostly on scott stevens their captain who also scored the game 's first goal it 's always nice to score stevens said of his goal but he noted that the most important thing for the devils was essentially keeping bure in check we had a bit of a problem for a while but i believe we 'll be better for the next game stevens said we 've got a couple of days to work on things game 2 is at continental arena on sunday petr sykora sergei brylin and scott gomez scored the other goals for the devils against panther goalie mike vernon who could have prevented two of the scores vernon faced 33 shots and had no memorable saves martin brodeur had an average game by his standards in goal for the devils brodeur allowed goals by rob niedermayer peter worrell and mike sillinger brodeur who faced 23 shots should have prevented worrell 's goal which eluded him over the glove from far away on the left side you do n't like to get scored on from there brodeur said you just go on and make the next save i thought we had a great start in this game stevens who scored two goals in last spring 's first round elimination by the pittsburgh penguins opened the scoring just 98 seconds into the game taking the puck from a face off won by holik stevens found the upper right corner from the left circle with a blistering shot that gave vernon no chance the enthusiastic crowd barely had time to settle down before sykora gave the fans more reason to roar sykora scored his goal with a backhander as he came around the goal from right to left at 4 minutes 2 seconds into the game things got better for the devils at the 15 28 mark in the first when brylin beat vernon over the left shoulder from the left circle after the panthers had several chances to clear their zone the devils lost their focus the rest of the period and paid the price as goals by niedermayer and worrell closed the gap to a goal before the first intermission niedermayer scored the first from close range on the left at 16 55 and worrell beat brodeur over the glove from the left circle moments after he came out of the penalty box with only 165 seconds left in the period an unassisted goal by gomez from the left circle that vernon should have handled extended the devils lead at 7 21 of the second period it proved to be the winner because sillinger closed the gap to one goal at the 13 50 mark in the second for the last goal in the game slap shots jason arnott the center of the devils first line missed the entire third period with a sprained right wrist arnott left the game with 1 minute 40 seconds left in the second period and went to the hospital for x rays that proved negative i jammed it arnott said i 'll just have to ice it like crazy i will play sunday sergei nemchinov centered for patrik elias and petr sykora for most of the time in the third period the devils scott niedermayer served the last game of his 10 game suspension for hitting peter worrell on the helmet with his stick
