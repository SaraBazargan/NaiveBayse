president bush got it wrong last week when he blamed senate democrats for the impasse over his judicial nominees and he started down a risky path when he urged the senate to abandon its longstanding rule permitting filibusters of judicial nominations the reason his nominees have met with resistance is not democratic intransigence or a flawed rule it is that many are far right ideologues whose views offend most americans there is only one way to end the deadlock compromise speaking in the rose garden on friday president bush warned of a crisis over the senate 's failure to confirm his nominations quickly enough judicial vacancies he said are causing delays for citizens seeking justice in truth judicial vacancies are at the lowest level in years and the senate has been confirming president bush 's nominees more rapidly than it did president bill clinton 's the only crisis at hand is that the white house is having trouble getting its most politically extreme nominees confirmed what kind of nominees are senate democrats balking at one an arkansas anti abortion activist has written that women should be subordinate to men another argued as a justice department lawyer that bob jones university should keep its tax exempt status even though it discriminated against blacks senators who demand that federal judges have a record of standing up for equality for women and minorities are not obstructing they are doing their jobs president bush backed a proposal by bill frist the senate majority leader to change the senate rules effectively ending filibusters for judicial nominees filibusters which prevent senate action through endless debate have a long tradition including use against judicial nominations republicans helped lead a filibuster in 1968 that stopped abe fortas from becoming chief justice of the united states and just three years ago republicans tried to use a filibuster to block richard paez a clinton nominee who took four years to be confirmed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit senator frist who now questions the constitutionality of the filibuster was one of only 14 senators to vote in favor of a filibuster at the time mr frist now says he was only seeking more debate the filibuster is not a tool to be used lightly but the constitution requires the senate 's advice and consent on judicial nominees as a check on the power of the president and this also must not be taken lightly president bush should allow the senate to conduct its oversight of his judicial choices as it sees fit as for senator frist 's proposal itself it would damage our constitutional system if senate republicans tried to rewrite longstanding rules for advice and consent for immediate partisan gain president bush misstated the record when he declared in the rose garden that a small group of democrats is blocking his judicial nominees in a vote on a controversial nominee earlier this month republicans mustered only 52 votes in the 100 member senate to end a filibuster the reason bush nominees are having trouble is that a large number of senators who represent many millions of americans find their views offensive senate democrats have asked to work with the white house to identify qualified candidates who are acceptable to all sides but so far the white house has insisted on its right to name judges who are far outside the mainstream if president bush wants to end the impasse he should take the democrats up on their offer
