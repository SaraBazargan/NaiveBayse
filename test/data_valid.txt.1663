you can not spit in the eye of the nation 's highest court without suffering consequences the florida supreme court ignored the us supreme court 's order nullifying its deadline breaking action and in effect told the nation 's final judicial tribunal to mind its own business florida 's four judge majority not content with taking over the lawmaking function of its state 's legislature and brushing aside the dire warning of creating an unnecessary crisis from its own chief justice arrogated to itself the power to pursue its political course despite direction to the contrary a few days before from the top of the nation 's court system not in living memory have americans seen such judicial chutzpah our political process was almost subverted by a runaway court perhaps the us supreme court invited florida 's disrespect in its eagerness to preserve its own unanimity and to show undue deference to a state court 's interference in a federal election the high court in washington had temporized in its first opinion rather than cleanly reversing the tallahassee jurists the rehnquist court acquiesced in its liberal members suggestion to learn the legal reasoning behind the florida decision to ignore the us constitution 's delegation of electoral power to state legislatures the tallahassee majority read that deference as weakness rather than answer the high court 's questions it took constitutional law into its own hands and extended the agony of the gore campaign by ordering a count of votes whose legality is in dispute bush partisans mistakenly made much of the narrow split in the florida court as if a 4 to 3 decision was somehow less than decisive but in our judicial system the narrowest majority carries the full power of the entire court that runaway court 's order to start counting was promptly and rightly obeyed until a majority of the highest court recognizing its deference had been misplaced and its authority was being challenged stayed the counting fingers in our presidential elections the constitutional majority rules that means the majority of electors of all the states when the votes of the people in a state amount to a virtual tie the nation 's choice of a president can not suitably be made by one state 's executive branch in this case for bush or that state 's judicial branch for gore rather the state 's vote must be decided in the manner the us constitution specifically directs by its legislature for bush or if the contest goes all the way by the newly elected house of representatives voting by states 29 of which have republican majorities that would elect bush but do we need to go all the way to that bitter end no with the house vote certain for bush it serves nobody 's purpose to prolong the interregnum we have an institution in place that a majority of the people trusts to decide what is the most constitutionally defensible solution that is the us supreme court so what if the justices are internally divided on this election issue they were far from unanimous on roe v wade and yet even those who disagree with that majority 's decision recognize it as the law of the land unanimity is a consummation devoutly to be wished but the high court 's majority rules and its decision can not be overridden except by a future high court or by amending the constitution now we are at a point where the highest court can no longer delay its decision in hopes that an inferior court will act responsibly by its coming decision on the late count the supreme court will be deciding a to validate for our time article ii 's unambiguous assignment of electoral power to elected state legislatures with its enabling statutes passed long ago by congress b to restore order to the judicial system by curbing the runaway state court and c to lend some of its own legitimacy to the political victor in an election where there can be neither a statistical winner or loser all during the campaign of 2000 al gore kept saying that this election was about the supreme court turns out he was right it is fitting that we now call on the nine justices to bite the ballot and call on the contestants to abide by the majority 's judgment
