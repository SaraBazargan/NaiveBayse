the last time the jets experimented with using an unorthodox player in a goal line situation it turned out so badly that their offensive coordinator paul hackett contended that he removed all film clips of it from the team 's training facility here it was in herman edwards 's first regular season game as head coach in 2001 a 45 24 loss to the indianapolis colts the reserve offensive tackle david loverne went the wrong way causing vinny testaverde to fumble the ball which the colts returned 95 yards for a touchdown ending the jets comeback hopes two years later that fiasco has not deterred the jets from trying again perhaps not since william refrigerator perry lined up in the bears backfield has a player so appropriately named been asked to assume a position that is not his own but james reed the jets 283 pound backup defensive tackle began practicing today as a fullback in goal line situations with a month until a game that counts the jets have plenty of time to experiment and reed known as tank is willing as a kid reed dreamed of being a running back but then he grew too big i love it he said if they let me get the ball i 'll love it more not so fast we started out with 'you have to know which way to go hackett said in the age of the salary cap few teams invest big money in fullbacks the position is overshadowed by big ticket running backs receivers and even linemen and no team can afford to keep a goal line specialist on the 53 man roster so when fullback richie anderson who went to the pro bowl in 2000 after having 88 receptions became a free agent after last season the jets let him go to dallas jerald sowell anderson 's backup is listed as the starter but the jets have found that they may use a combination of three or four people to fill all the roles once played by anderson the jets are also trying lamont jordan as a fullback in the backfield with curtis martin but jordan 's role will be entirely different he will be used as a receiver but not as a blocker reed 's role as his nickname suggests will be to blast a hole through the line of scrimmage reed was a linebacker and offensive tackle in high school and occasionally lined up in the backfield on goal line situations but his history suggests that taking handoffs is not in his future either i got the ball one time reed said of his high school days i tried to cut and i fell i was a barry sanders fan and i was a lot faster back then edwards had the idea to use reed and hackett admitted that the jets are concerned about the fullback position on the goal line unit they are trying to determine if reed can make the switch from reacting when the offense snaps the ball to being ready to go when the offense goes today reed worked after practice with the backup brooks bollinger to learn the quarterbacks cadence but there is no guarantee reed will ever get into a game as a fullback sowell has been superb hackett said but jerald sowell split time with richie so now we have to look for a way we can get jerald sowell the relief that richie got richie 's effectiveness had a lot to do with the fact jerald sowell was there for reed this is also a chance to expand a career that has so far been stuck on the depth chart in his third season he is the backup to james ferguson at nose tackle last season he had 28 tackles reed said he was feeling down in the first week of training camp because he thought he had started slowly and was not using the proper techniques now he feels better in part because his weight is the lowest it has been in four years and he feels faster and so with a smile reed ponders the offensive possibilities i look better than fridge he said i 'm compact extra points the fireworks leading up to the jets season opener at washington on sept 4 have begun coach herman edwards who rarely responds to criticism especially from players responded thursday to a recent series of verbal jabs from the former receiver laveranues coles coles has expressed bitterness over how the jets treated him during contract negotiations before he left for the redskins as a restricted free agent among other things coles told sports illustrated that edwards said coles would be with the jets as long as edwards was the coach i know what i said and i think he knows what i said edwards said he has a right to feel how he feels i like laveranues as a player i think he 's a young man who is growing up and maturing and i think there is still a lot more maturing he 's going to have to go through it 's a part of the process of him growing up i 'll leave it at that most of the jets starters will play the entire first quarter sunday against the cincinnati bengals at giants stadium defensive end bryan thomas sprained ankle will not play the jets signed the rookie free agent patrick smith an offensive lineman and long snapper from the university of central arkansas
