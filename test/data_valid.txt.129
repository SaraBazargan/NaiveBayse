these have been trying times for buyers of convertible securities says theodore t southworth who runs the 204 million northern income equity fund ideally convertibles bonds or preferred shares that can be converted to common shares at a predetermined exchange rate will account for all of the fund 's holdings he said but he has reduced that proportion to only 76 percent because few convertibles have been issued recently and there are fewer good buys available he said at the moment stocks account for 10 percent of the fund 's holdings and cash represents 14 percent he said that he believed that the supply of convertibles would remain tight because financial markets are still unsettled companies have n't yet reached the point where they 're looking for money for general corporate purposes he said the fund lost 05 percent a year on average for the three years through thursday compared with a 52 percent loss for all convertible bond funds according to morningstar the standard poor 's 500 stock index fell at an annual rate of 135 percent in that period the fund declined 33 percent in the 12 months through thursday compared with losses of 65 percent for its group and 229 percent for the s p 500 morningstar said mr southworth 54 is a senior vice president of northern trust which owns northern trust investments the fund 's adviser generally he said convertible securities which pay interest give investors exposure to stock market profits but with less risk his goal is to identify convertible issues with high potential for gains he picks the fund 's 80 or so convertibles mostly from among about 600 domestic convertibles whose underlying common stock has good earnings growth potential and sells for reasonable valuations while he reviews a company 's fundamentals including cash flow and earnings growth rate he also pays attention to technical analysis the study of a stock 's price movements over the last year or two when the price charts deviate from analysts expectations he said that he puts his faith in the charts which reflect the actual behavior of the great majority of investors in april mr southworth bought a convertible preferred security due in may 2005 issued by alltel a regional phone company based in little rock ark he paid 4981 for the issue which yielded 775 percent it closed on friday at 4790 because the issue is a mandatory convertible which must convert to common shares on a specific date regardless of its stock price at the time its price fluctuates more like a high yielding equity than a bond mr southworth said it is unrated by standard poor 's but rated a2 by moody 's investors service a midlevel investment grade rating he expects annual earnings growth of 8 percent in the next three years he bought a 575 percent senior convertible note due in april 2007 and issued by airborne inc in seattle he paid 9434 for the note in october 2002 it closed on friday at 10725 the issue is rated bbb  by standard poor 's its lowest investment grade rating the stock was bumping along at 10 because the market seemed to make the judgment that the economy would never recover mr southworth said we thought that we 'd avoid a double dip recession and if the economy grows the transportation sector will have to participate he also owns a bb  rated subordinated convertible note due june 2006 issued by the interpublic group of companies the new york based holding group of advertising agencies last summer interpublic 's stock price got clobbered when its earnings did n't meet expectations and everyone worried about whether they can believe anything that management told us he said he bought the issue before the securities and exchange commission notified interpublic in january that it was upgrading an informal inquiry into the company 's accounting practices to a formal investigation i do n't know whether the investigation will amount to anything he said but i 'm still reasonably happy with the purchase he paid 6550 on friday the convertible note closed at 77
