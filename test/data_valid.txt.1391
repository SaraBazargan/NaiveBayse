when reginald brinson of roosevelt first learned that a charter school would be opening in his school district he immediately sent in an application for his daughter regine the school district was in disarray mr brinson said adding that he was attracted by promises that the roosevelt children 's academy charter school would have smaller class sizes and more structured instruction over the past four years she has excelled and today in third grade she reads on a fifth grade level sheree sophas has been driving her daughter attallah now in fourth grade to the roosevelt charter school from their home in far rockaway a 40 minute commute in our local district there were not enough supplies and 30 kids in a class ms sophas said for us to be willing to commute this has to be an excellent school the roosevelt charter school is one of three that have opened over the past few years on long island the other two are in the riverhead and east hampton school districts and are among 55 charter schools now open in new york state state law was amended to allow them in 1998 charter schools are public tuition free schools that operate independently within existing school districts competing with regular public schools for students and tax dollars they are free from most state educational mandates that control teaching methodologies but must take the same student achievement tests taken by the regular public schools charter schools typically offer an extended school day and a highly structured academic program the roosevelt school with 300 students in kindergarten through fifth grade has received glowing accolades from parents teachers and students the school operated by victory schools which runs 12 charter schools in three states boasts a 95 percent retention rate for students near perfect retention for teachers classes of no more than 25 and a waiting list of 119 children but when the scores of new york state fourth grade tests were released in october the results left some questions about its academic performance among fourth graders at the roosevelt charter school 60 percent of the students met the state standards on the verbal exam compared to 69 percent of fourth graders in the rest of the roosevelt district in math 68 percent of the students at the charter school met state standards 11 percentage points behind the other roosevelt schools this disparity was also evident for the island 's two other charter schools in riverhead the difference was 14 points on the verbal test and 20 points in math while 80 percent of fourth graders in the east hampton elementary school met state standards in the verbal test none of the students in the tiny test sample four students did at the charter school in math 90 percent met the mark in the elementary school but only 60 percent three of the five students did so at the charter school charter school administrators defended their performance many of our kids have come to the charter school because they were not performing well in their own local districts said steven cohen executive director of the riverhead charter school which opened in 2001 and is managed by edison schools which operates charter schools in more than 20 states the true test will be when our students who started with us in kindergarten reach fourth grade and then we see how well they do mr cohen said his school was already closing the gap from 2002 to 2003 the percentage of our students who met the standards in english language arts went from 36 to 55 he said while students in the riverhead public school district gained 9 percentage points and statewide gains were 3 percent in math our gain was 29 percent compared to 10 percent in the riverhead public schools the pattern is being repeated statewide this month the state board of regents reported that while most children in charter schools fall below state standards their test scores are improving and that the gains accelerated during the 2002 2003 school year with the largest improvement in fourth grade math many public school administrators have opposed charter schools arguing that they would siphon money and talent from struggling public schools though they declined to point fingers over the latest results some educators remain skeptical that charter schools are staffed to maintain one of my concerns about charter schools is that by law they can hire non certified teachers said raymond gualtieri superintendent of the east hampton school district state law says that as many as 30 percent of teachers in charter schools may be uncertified when schools are managed by a business and administrators are non educators they do n't have the innate knowledge from being a classroom teacher for 10 years dr gualtieri said when you do n't come up through the ranks you lack the understanding of the nuances of education it 's like hiring someone who 's not a doctor to run a hospital how can he try to organize a surgery schedule without a background in medicine vivian isom a spokeswoman for the roosevelt school district discounted the disparity in test scores between the charter school and the school district our scores were higher than the charter school but they have n't been open as long as we have she said they have some challenges to meet but we all have mountains to climb research has shown it takes five years for a school to reach its full strength said roxanne ashley principal of the roosevelt charter school we 're just starting our fourth year she said and we 're on an upward spiral that i know will continue
