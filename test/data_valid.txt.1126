with the inauguration of george w bush as president democrats can no longer deny that al gore lost the election despite winning the popular vote but they can disagree and did today over why he did not perform better at a democratic forum here party theorists split sharply over the effectiveness of mr gore 's strategy centrists said he came across as too liberal too approving of big government and relied too heavily on an outdated message of class warfare those to the left particularly unions said mr gore was hurt by the conservative climate made less hospitable by bill clinton 's sex scandals and that his populist theme was his strongest argument for election the debate reflects the deep rift in the party over its economic message evident for the last two years as mr gore began his campaign with appeals to moderate suburban families and concluded it with appeals to the people not the powerful the party rift reflects the clash between two of mr gore 's pollsters mark penn of the centrists and stanley greenberg a populist mr greenberg did not attend today 's session sponsored by the centrist democratic leadership council but in an attempt to reach across the ideological divide the group gave a seat to steve rosenthal political director of the afl cio an organization it usually keeps at arm 's length on the centrist side al from chief of the democratic leadership council said that given the strong economy mr gore should have won easily but mr from said mr gore failed to reach the wired workers of the new economy mr penn branded mr gore 's campaign one of lost opportunity saying mr gore reverted to an old style populism that alienated independent suburban white men he did well among upper income women mr penn said largely because he supported abortion rights but he said mr gore abandoned the fight for smaller government losing new economy men who favored smaller government fiscal discipline and personal responsibility in a strong rebuttal mr rosenthal rejected the notion that mr gore performed poorly he pointed out that mr gore received 539000 more votes than mr bush mr rosenthal argued that mr gore 's chief problem was the climate created by mr clinton 's impeachment he said polls showed that voters who cared most about issues tended to vote for mr gore and those who cared about character voted for mr bush he dismissed mr penn 's argument that mr gore 's populism had hurt him does anybody believe this was an election about left right and center politics mr rosenthal asked instead mr rosenthal said mr gore surged when he tried to separate himself from mr clinton and declared himself my own man mr greenberg in a report for the institute for america 's future argued that mr gore could not capitalize on the nation 's prosperity in part because he would have had to credit mr clinton for it and that would have stirred up anti clinton zeal the right 's cultural war to bring down clinton and the impeachment took its toll leaving voters doubtful on trust and values mr greenberg wrote these complex feelings about clinton made it difficult to advance themes that put clinton at the center of the narrative to the contrary mr penn wrote in his own analysis mr clinton was one of the most popular presidents gore failed to capture even those that did like the president he wrote the democrats agreed that mr bush had succeeded in blurring party distinctions and had defied the conventional wisdom that proposing to privatize part of social security would be fatal george bush touched the third rail said william a galston a long time adviser to the council we turned the juice on and he survived the democrats also agreed that the party needed to expand its appeal to men and moderates but mr rosenthal said that specifically the next democratic presidential candidates should be able to relate easily to ordinary people the key question we should ask the prospective democratic candidates for president in 2004 is 'can you hang mr rosenthal said let 's see how you hang on a corner in south philadelphia bush can hang you know clinton can hang al gore i 've seen him he can hang but he did n't show it in this election
