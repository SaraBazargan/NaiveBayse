after 33 years in office state senator roy m goodman has agreed to step down and take a position in the bloomberg administration clearing the way for what should be a hotly contested race to secure his seat and represent the upper east side senator goodman the 71 year old heir to a pharmaceutical fortune is widely seen as the leader of the moderate wing of the republican party he is one of the last liberals in the tradition of former gov nelson a rockefeller in the state senate an erudite man who refers to himself as a fiscal conservative with a social conscience he has been a champion for the arts legalized abortion gun control and lower taxes the senator said last night that he had accepted an offer from the mayor elect michael r bloomberg to become the president of the united nations development corporation a state and city agency that finances building and renovation projects for the united nations as president mr goodman would also be a liaison between city hall and secretary general kofi annan i have loved my time in the senate but after a third of a century it was time to shift my focus from domestic matters to foreign policy concerns he said i think this gives me a chance to do some helpful work senator goodman 's nomination still must be approved by the corporation 's 15 member board it is unlikely that the board will vote him down however since the members all serve at the pleasure of the new mayor and gov george e pataki also a republican nothing 's been officially decided but certainly the mayor elect and the city would be well served by roy goodman who has had such a long and distinguished career said edward skyler a spokesman for mr bloomberg senator goodman barely won re election in 2000 against a democratic challenger liz krueger he eked out a 200 vote advantage only after paper ballots were counted when he arrived in albany a year ago for the new session he joked about the election calling himself landslide goodman ms krueger 44 former director of the community food resource center said today that she would run again for the seat if a special election were held which mr pataki is expected to schedule in january or february on the republican side party leaders said the likely candidate would be assemblyman john ravitz who has long expressed an interest in succeeding mr goodman mr ravitz did not return telephone calls last night republican strategists speaking on the condition of anonymity predicted that the state party and the senate majority leader joseph l bruno would throw considerable resources behind mr ravitz should he run mayor rudolph w giuliani whose popularity has been high since the terrorist attacks can be counted on to campaign for mr ravitz they said given the closeness of the last race the democrats will also fight hard and spend heavily for ms krueger in an effort to take a seat away from the senate 's republican majority the state party chairman herman d farrell jr said i think she will win easily if she 's running against anyone but roy he said the senate meanwhile is losing one of its most colorful characters senator goodman was known in the capital as an expert storyteller and orator whose store of jokes seemed endless on the issues however mr goodman often clashed with his more conservative colleagues on social questions in his first term he played a pivotal role in the historic debate that ended with a razor thin vote to legalize abortion last year he led the charge in the senate to pass a hate crimes bill that finally recognized homosexuals as targets of discrimination in between he sponsored more than 1200 pieces of legislation he was instrumental in creating the school construction authority and passing several laws protecting poor tenants from eviction he played a major role establishing state programs to fight aids and sponsored several important gun control laws senator goodman a son of manhattan 's upper class who graduated from harvard has also been an ardent tireless supporter of the arts ensuring that millions of dollars in grants flowed each year from albany into new york city 's museums theaters and concert halls the senator said the main focus of his new job would be to make sure that the united nations remained in new york city the united nations needs about 1 billion to refurbish its headquarters building he said and another 300 million to create new office space some of that could be raised through the development corporation he said but the city would have to coax financing out of washington we need to bolster the un and that 's something i take seriously senator goodman said it makes it a stimulating way to have another chapter in a career that has been oriented toward domestic stuff
