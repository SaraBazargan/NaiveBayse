margarita saldarriaga arboletes colombia june 22 2003 saldarriaga center arboletes is a very simple town very poor its attraction is the volcano i 've never heard of it erupting it is a tourist spot they say bathing in the volcano 's mud cures arthritis pain and asthma and that it 's good for the skin along the banks the mud is drier so to get all muddy you have to go to the center some people dive in as if it were a pool you feel like you should sink but you just stay up it 's a strange feeling it is difficult to get out because the mud is heavy you have to slide like a snake you go wash in the sea and then you feel like new i wanted to show arboletes to my friend steve who is visiting from america i 'm from medellin about eight hours away by bus there was an army presence for the entire trip steve was shocked but i 'm used to it i never stopped taking trips in colombia because of fear i 've been in places that are considered 100 percent guerrilla zones i would tell his family or anyone from the states not to worry just come if it 's your turn to die it 'll happen wherever you are interview by silvana paternostro
