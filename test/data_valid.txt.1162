more than 50 million americans have signed up for the federal do not call registry to protect themselves from phone solicitations rather than let these people eat dinner in peace the telemarketing industry rushed into court it persuaded two federal judges this week to strike down the registry these decisions are as legally flawed as they are unpopular they should be reversed on appeal and the do not call registry should go forward americans resent telemarketers commandeering phones and phone lines that they do not pay for to spread messages that are not wanted and they are enraged by the latest technology predictive dialers which allows telemarketers to call several homes at once and connect to the first that answers hanging up on everyone else the telemarketing industry talks about respecting people 's privacy but it argued in court that telemarketers have a constitutional right to call the 50 million americans who do not want to hear from them a federal district court in denver agreed with the industry that the do not call registry violates the first amendment because it discriminates on the basis of content treating commercial calls differently from charitable or political ones the consumers who sign up are automatically protected from commercial solicitations but blocking solicitations like charitable calls must be done on a charity by charity basis the telemarketers first amendment claims are serious ones but the denver court gave them too much weight and the federal trade commission 's defenses too little these free speech issues arise in a particular setting not public spaces but the homes of people who have expressly requested to be left alone the constitution recognizes americans special interest in maintaining privacy within their homes and the communication here is purely commercial speech which is less protected than speech that is more at the core of first amendment values it is true that the do not call registry makes distinctions based on speech content something the government often can not do but it does so to focus on the heart of the telemarketing problem and it provides avenues albeit different ones for blocking both commercial and charitable speech the other decision this week by a federal judge in oklahoma is weaker still it found that the ftc had overstepped its authority when it established the registry even if the decision is not reversed on appeal it will most likely be irrelevant the senate has voted 95 to 0 and the house 412 to 8 to give the ftc the authority it needs the implications of the telemarketers challenge go far beyond telemarketing the legal battle lines are also being drawn now over no fax registries and restrictions on unwanted e mail and as technology advances there is no telling what other ways marketers will devise to speak to people against their will it is important that the law develop in ways that allow people to protect their privacy against these mounting invasions upholding do not call registries is the right place to start in these cases 50 million americans 95 senators and 412 members of the house are not wrong two judges are
