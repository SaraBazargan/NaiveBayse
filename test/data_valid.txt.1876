lori berenson was convicted on wednesday and sentenced to 20 years in prison minus time served by a three judge civilian court in lima for her involvement with peru 's tupac amaru revolutionary movement in the mid 1990 's although the evidence suggests she may indeed have aided the violent marxist guerrilla group the sentence is unduly harsh in light of her marginal role in the conspiracy and the case 's tainted and tortuous history ms berenson a native new yorker has already been imprisoned under harsh conditions for more than five years and her case was manipulated by the corrupt fujimori regime president elect alejandro toledo and the supreme court should acknowledge this history and end her prison ordeal ms berenson 's civilian trial was fairer to be sure than the 1996 sham proceeding in a military antiterrorist court that convicted her of treason and sentenced her to life in prison in that trial ms berenson 's lawyers were not even allowed to examine the prosecution 's evidence or cross examine witnesses but the civilian trial undertaken after her military conviction was overturned still relied on evidence gathered in the first tainted process at her civilian trial ms berenson faced lesser charges of collaborating with the guerrillas though no longer accused of being a leader of the tupac amaru group she was accused of knowingly renting a house to serve as a headquarters for a thwarted assault on the peruvian congress and of posing as a journalist to obtain information on the layout and workings of the legislative chamber she says she is innocent but even if she were not wednesday 's harsh sentence validating a tainted prosecution offends basic notions of justice the supreme court which will hear ms berenson 's appeal should consider reducing her sentence to time served alternatively mr toledo who is to assume the presidency next month could exercise his clemency power to attain justice both should apply the same principle of due process and proportionate penalties to all similarly situated peruvian prisoners this is not about special treatment for an american but a fresh start for peruvian justice
