at a gas station the other day i saw an advertisement attached at eye level near the fuel hose i have also seen ads on shopping carts and heard commercials on the phone when a business puts me on hold and i begin each day at my computer beneath an avalanche of e mail sales pitches for laser printer cartridges low interest mortgages and cut rate viagra as i 'm deleting all this junk i sometimes think of william forster lloyd the english economist who in the 1830 's described the problem of the commons why are the cattle on a common so puny and stunted lloyd asked why is the common itself so bare worn and cropped so differently from the adjoining enclosures his answer was that it was in the interest of everyone using the common pasture to exploit it maximally each herdsman could benefit by adding another cow but when all the herdsmen acted this way as they inevitably would the benefit of the commons was lost to everyone modern day business fails to recognize the level of abuse to which it is subjecting the commons of consumer consciousness for example the average child sees more than 20000 commercials a year according to the american academy of pediatrics total advertising spending in this country is about 100 billion a year or something approaching 400 for every man woman and child may i suggest that diminishing returns are starting to set in here besides the commercial media culture supported by this spending is itself probably undermining the spending power of consumers leon botstein president of bard college and the author of jefferson 's children education and the promise of american culture doubleday 1997 wrote in the journal daedalus about the effect of television on education he asserted that the simplification and standardization of language restricts people 's range of expression and even thought in other words the commercially inspired fare that now prevails certainly is n't making people smarter in its absence productivity and thus purchasing power would probably increase in the face of these trends signs of advertiser desperation abound television executives worry about new technologies that allow people to skip commercials and the internet is littered with increasingly frantic pop ups and other sales pitches as the costs go down the number of pitches multiplies something that lloyd might have predicted every morning from all over the globe the e mail comes pouring in never before have cut rate ink jet cartridges been so readily available to me to say nothing of golden investment opportunities luxury travel and products to enhance the libido i get a good volume of legitimate e mail yet some days the spam unsolicited commercial speech if you 're squeamish outweighs it by 10 to 1 perhaps the most serious sign of desperation is the reincarnation of advertising 's hidden persuaders this time as a pack of executives and consultants who specialize in jungian analysis semiotics and other such recondite arts these concepts are applied to such questions as how to more effectively sell breakfast cereal and soft drinks naturally enough marketers have burst the bounds of traditional advertising in favor of product placements in movies and the like bulgari even paid the writer fay weldon to write a novel featuring the company even if the boundaries of acceptable advertising expand the commons of consumer consciousness will not the more consumers are battered by this ceaseless marketing assault the less value each advertising dollar will have one proven approach to better stewardship of the commons is to place a cap on use and to allow users to buy and sell their allocations this is hard to do of course so something like more traditional regulation might make sense in new york state the no calls registry for those wanting to avoid telemarketers is a good model and at the minimum business should mobilize all the lobbyists at its command for a federal ban on junk e mail like the one that suppressed junk faxes years ago but the larger issue may have to resolve itself increasingly the most desirable consumers will opt out by ignoring commercial radio and television and hiding behind technologies that exempt them from the onslaught until advertisers are left with something like lloyd 's barren commons all over again applied to consumer consciousness scrawny companies feeding off overgrazed pasture it 's not a pretty picture for anyone on the contrary daniel akst 's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first sunday of each month e mail culmoney nytimescom
