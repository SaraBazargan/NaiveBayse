to the editor parents oppose return date for a school at ground zero news article jan 4 implies that a majority of parents do not want public school 89 to return to its building on warren street in february my experience is different i believe that a majority want our school to return immediately we and many other families have moved back to battery park city we have rolled up our sleeves and begun rebuilding our community every morning rather than walk our kids to school we take them to a bus stop and ship them across town if you stand at the bus stop you will hear the real voices of the community of parents who showed determination by coming back of families who live near ground zero and walk with the brave firefighters police and construction workers every day if you listen to these voices the message is clear we are back bring our school back michael w fortenbaugh new york jan 4 2002
