connie ploetz considers herself a tolerant wife she does not mind that her custom built log cabin in collins ny about an hour south of buffalo is home to a coyote a crow a pheasant several whitetail deer an elk and two woodchucks all trophies of animals that had been bagged by her husband kevin a hunter and outdoors enthusiast it was the turkeys that made mrs ploetz feel a little crowded after mr ploetz had his third one mounted she gently suggested that when he shot his next bird he might instead keep a smaller souvenir thus mr ploetz 's idea for a turkey beard display device for which he received united states patent 6451393 in september the turkey beard it turns out is to the wild turkey what antlers are to a whitetail deer the physical manifestation of power and virility the spread of the turkey 's tailfan as well as the size of the spurs on the backs of its legs are also barometers of bravado but as he was looking to economize on space mr ploetz decided to focus his inventive energies solely on the beard the black beard not to be confused with the dewlap that rubbery red cascade down the turkey 's throat hangs from the turkey 's chest it 's very coarse like a broom almost mr ploetz said it looks like hair growth but actually it 's mutated feathers especially virile toms have multiple beards and an occasional female will sport a beard though some hunters mr ploetz said consider it bad luck to bag a hen with a beard the longer the beard the more impressive the bird a young male turkey known as a jake will have a beard of 3 to 4 inches while the beard of a trophy tom is 9 to 11 inches and can be as long as 18 inches the uninitiated might assume that beard collecting is as simple as snipping off a lock of hair for a keepsake not so posted on the message board of wwwtaxidermynet for example are several woeful beard laments one taxidermist confessed that the real beard having disintegrated he fashioned a sort of turkey toupee out of horsehair the main difficulty seems to be keeping all the hair together some hunters glue the end with epoxy and stick them into the same shotgun shell they used in bringing down the bird mr ploetz liked the idea of attaching the beard to the spent shell but found the gluing messy and difficult so he designed a plastic device that resembles a threaded bolt with a ring at one end you cut the beard off taking a little bit of flesh with the beard mr ploetz said then you dip the fleshy part of the beard in the preservative and screw the bolt end through the shell and into the fleshy part when the flesh dries it is tough and hard and securely stuck to the plastic and the shell the beard can then be hung from the ring on a plaque or however the hunter chooses to display it the preservative is necessary mr ploetz said otherwise bugs will eat it up mr ploetz sells his devices 5 for a four pack preservative included at gun shows and his wife sells some on ebay though a florida taxidermist recently ordered some hunters are not yet buying them up but mr ploetz thinks that the market is potentially huge the national wild turkey federation estimates that there are about 54 million wild turkeys and about 26 million turkey hunters in north america moreover since turkeys with their keen eyesight and instincts are hard won prey hunters are especially motivated to keep souvenirs whitetail deer are skittish and sly and cunning but i have a lot more luck with them than turkeys said mr ploetz who has passed many an early dawn trying to woo a tom with yelps and clucks and purrs only to have the bird walk away in the end it 's frustrating that a bird with a brain the size of a quarter can outsmart me he said mrs ploetz will be cooking a fresh turkey for thanksgiving this year a 10 pound bird that mr ploetz shot with some tag team turkey calling assistance from friends otherwise toms proved elusive this fall hunting season on thursday though what did i bump into this morning less than 200 yards from my house mr ploetz said a flock of turkeys alas hunting season ended four days earlier
