dr peter b corr the new research chief at pfizer says he lives by the 80 20 rule at least 80 percent of every job must be challenging and enjoyable dr corr says that way he can live with the other 20 percent even if it leaves him flat his new job running pfizer 's network of laboratories spanning three continents and leading its 12000 scientists meets that rule the opportunities have never been greater he said beaming like a school kid scientist who had just received his first chemistry set sitting in pfizer 's manhattan headquarters in an office littered with moving boxes to be delivered to his predecessor dr john f niblack dr corr reflected last week on the task ahead of him most drug companies including pfizer are suffering from a lack of new discoveries the last blockbuster drug to come out of pfizer 's labs which now spend 53 billion a year on research more than any other pharmaceutical company was viagra approved in 1998 dr corr a cardiologist and former professor of medicine at washington university in st louis must make pfizer 's labs more productive if pfizer 's proposed purchase of pharmacia is approved by shareholders and federal regulators as is expected he will also have to stitch together two research operations and disprove critics who say bigger is not better in drug research it is quite clear that greater scale in research and development does not mean greater productivity said ashish singh vice president at bain company a consulting firm but dr corr said he believed you need the power of scale to exploit the science dr corr 54 has been through this before he is the only top executive of warner lambert to remain after pfizer 's takeover in 2000 at warner lambert he was also in charge of research and development peter corr proved himself to be a consummate problem solver during that combination said viren mehta a partner at mehta partners a health care investment firm in manhattan he was recognized for forming a successful partnership with john niblack dr niblack was at pfizer for 35 years before retiring this month dr corr officially took over in july his problem solving skills mr mehta said will be needed in the pharmacia merger during an interview the only questions that seemed to deflate dr corr 's bubble of enthusiasm were one about rezulin a diabetes drug that warner lambert withdrew from the market after dozens of deaths and one about whether pfizer could attract the top pharmaceutical scientists a measure of the quality of a drug company 's labs on rezulin dr corr would say only that the experience had been difficult and that he could not say more because of litigation as for attracting great scientists he said after a bit of hesitation they 're knocking down the doors that may be but others say pfizer is not leading the way in hiring science 's brightest john archer an executive recruiter at russell reynolds associates who found dr corr for the job at warner lambert said scientists had recently been drawn to abbott laboratories where research is led by dr jeff leiden and eli lilly where dr steven m paulis in charge of research what makes dr corr great for this job mr archer said is his ability to manage people and envision how research and development must be done in the future he can be threatening to some people because they see him as a change agent mr archer said dr corr said he had already visited pfizer 's major laboratories which stretch from groton conn to sandwich england and nagoya japan to meet their scientists it is important that they see you and realize that you 're just like them he said i 'm not bigger than life to attract creative scientists and make its labs more prolific pfizer has reorganized its labs into teams that give each more autonomy while still following a global strategy in addition dr corr is trying to reduce the number of projects that fail late in development when costs escalate and pfizer is forging earlier and stronger links between researchers and marketing executives the company is known as one of the first in the industry to see the value in having marketers participate in the early stages of drug development dr corr said that warner lambert had involved marketers in drug research to a small extent but that pfizer 's link between marketing and research is the best i 've ever seen one role of a marketer is to say what drugs would sell well if scientists could discover them for example dr corr said marketers may note that insomnia afflicts millions and that there is a great need for a nonhabit forming sleeping pill we do n't want to spend years on something he said that will have no impact on patient care born in utica ny in 1948 dr corr grew up with a love for science i was always exploring he said his father was chief executive of a food and merchandise brokerage company and would often take his son along with him on business trips dr corr graduated from union university in albany in 1971 and got his doctorate at georgetown university schools of medicine and dentistry in 1975 he then taught and did research at the washington university school of medicine in st louis students at the university 's school of medicine chose him as teacher of the year in 1981 he became a paid consultant to many drug companies including pfizer and warner lambert in 1994 he left academia to become a top research executive at searle a drug company in st louis that was then part of monsanto warner lambert hired him away in 1998 in a pfizer pharmacia merger many drugs that dr corr worked on at searle including celebrex and bextra two pain relievers would circle back to him pharmacia merged with monsanto in 1999 dr corr lives in mystic conn near pfizer 's research headquarters in groton he said he strives for a balance between work and life outside the office mainly time with his wife jill two daughters lauren 18 and jacqueline 14 and his sailboat windswill on long island sound where he loves to watch the sunsets you ca n't work all the time he said
