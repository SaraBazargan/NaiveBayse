there are plenty of lines in shakespeare 's works about the power of music you could say that the brooklyn philharmonic 's concert on friday night was putting that power to the test actually it was the power of shakespeare the program 's title that was on display at the brooklyn academy of music and that was being tested since although all three pieces were inspired by shakespeare the program failed to include the notes that would have explained this link you could say it was a test of thematic programming if a program exists without program notes can anyone hear the relation between the pieces well yes and no all three works on the program were broadly conceived spreading their wings to take in the full range of a symphony orchestra 's tones and timbres and all three like shakespeare ended on a moralizing note introducing a touch of reality caliban 's awakening a cappella from the choral and instrumental dreamscape of george benjamin 's sometime voices the final adagio movement dying away of hans werner henze 's eighth symphony or the fugue that concludes the last act of verdi 's falstaff all the world 's a joke but finding such links may be akin to equating three different paintings because they all have gold frames certainly the pieces were written in very different idioms sometime voices illustrated in episodic bursts caliban 's act iii monologue from a thousand twangling instruments here a mandolin and a banjo to the dream 's explosion with the instruments silenced as nmon ford the baritone sang i cried to dream again mr henze 's eighth symphony is a kind of intermezzo between the traditionally constructed seventh and the epic ambition of the ninth a tone poem based on scenes from a midsummer night 's dream the eighth dances with an artless richness of resource that you could possibly compare to the deft brilliant chortlings of verdi 's old age in falstaff but mr henze 's shakespeare has more in common with mendelssohn 's than with verdi 's under robert spano the brooklyn philharmonic added an additional cosmetic resemblance by playing with a slight heavy handedness the greatest single source of power onstage was thomas allen in his debut as falstaff that is n't necessarily a role you 'd associate with this eminent mozartean but any lack of vocal opulence was more than compensated for with vocal and dramatic command enriched by experience that made the contradictory comical and sometimes poignant character come fully to life mr ford acquitted himself honorably with a nice light baritone jennifer aylmer 's voice is a little heavy for nanetta she powered out her aria with little of the delicate tissue effect of this music
