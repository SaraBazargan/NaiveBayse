it 's not ebbets field it 's just a little ballpark in coney island for a mets farm team named the cyclones but it 's baseball in brooklyn and that 's enough to stir the soul of anyone who lived there before walter o'malley absconded with the dodgers i not only grew up there but i was also the last baseball writer to cover the brooklyn dodgers for the brooklyn eagle the newspaper that created its readers wait 'til next year philosophy with a 1941 headline but six months before the dodgers finally won the world series for brooklyn in 1955 after seven strikeouts the eagle suddenly was among the dearly departed what is the only major city in the country the joke went without a daily newspaper a railroad station and a left fielder oddly enough after so many left fielders were found wanting if not looking at a third strike a left fielder named sandy amoros made the catch near the foul line at yankee stadium that started the double play that assured johnny podres 's 2 0 masterpiece in the seventh game of the 1955 world series that victory answered all the prayers in what was known as the borough of churches two years later those prayers turned to curses when o'malley preferred wealth in chavez ravine to love in flatbush without the baseball team that was its identity brooklyn has n't been the same since and the cyclones named for the coney island boardwalk 's terrifying roller coaster wo n't bring back a time when there were more radios than television sets more open windows than air conditioning units with red barber 's voice coming through the summer swelter from all those open windows in two family homes or six story apartment houses i could walk for blocks in bay ridge and never miss a pitch i first went to ebbets field in 1938 when babe ruth was the dodgers first base coach by the time the dodgers won the 1941 pennant i was hooked not so much on the dodgers as on baseball itself do n't spread this around but i liked the cardinals more than the dodgers i liked the way the cardinals ran the bases in those uniforms with the red piping on the sleeves and i liked the way stan musial hit i was n't alone musial 's line drives all but knocked the ebbets field scoreboard into bedford avenue when he moved toward the batter 's box one day somebody yelled here 's that man stan the man had been christened if you were a kid in brooklyn during the 1942 pennant race which the cardinals won heaven was sitting in the upper center field bleachers for 55 cents with a bag of bologna sandwiches and enough nickels to buy cokes during a sunday doubleheader with the cardinals whitlow wyatt and kirby higbe against mort cooper and howard pollet up in those bleachers you had the same view that television 's center field camera does now you were up there behind hilda chester who stood in the front row clanging her cowbell by the seventh inning of the second game when most of the ushers had left you sneaked down through the stands and sat behind third base you got to ebbets field on the subway getting off at the prospect park station on the bmt and you went home on the subway the visiting team 's players even took the subway from their midtown manhattan hotels i got cardinal shortstop marty marion 's autograph with a small circle dotting the i on the subway outside the dodger clubhouse with a pencil and a program i once had position on pete reiser my favorite dodger but he stiffed me and all the other kids he burst out of the door shook hands with an older man and they hurried off together baseball was really america 's national pastime then boxing college basketball college football and horse racing were popular but pro football was an afterthought what is now the national basketball association was n't formed until 1946 and the national hockey league was a six team lodge baseball was the game especially when jackie robinson arrived in brooklyn in 1947 he 's still the best baseball player i 've ever seen because he could win a game so many different ways with a single or a home run with a great catch or stealing a base stealing home if necessary nobody steals home anymore he also played wherever the dodgers needed him without a murmur first base second base third base even left field about six weeks after i was hired by the eagle in 1951 as a clerk in the sports department for 40 a week i was in the composing room checking the lead type of page 1 with the headline dodgers win moments later somebody shouted bobby thomson hit a homer the giants won the printer yanked out the dodgers win headline and flung it into a bin two years later the eagle 's beat writer harold c burr broke his hip in a fall i had covered giants and yankees home games but now i was suddenly covering the dodgers the best beat in the business when the eagle folded i moved to the new york journal american on sept 24 1957 i took my olivetti portable typewriter to what everybody knew would be the dodgers last game in ebbets field danny mcdevitt a little left hander blanked the pirates 2 0 before 6702 mourners as the organist gladys goodding played auld lang syne two hours later bill roeder of the world telegram sun and i were the last to finish writing when we got to the night watchman 's door alongside the marble rotunda i stepped aside to let bill walk out then i walked out the last writer to leave ebbets field after the last dodger game
