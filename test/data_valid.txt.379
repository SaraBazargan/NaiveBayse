sunday in st louis against the most productive passing offense in nfl history the giants will play two rookie cornerbacks most striking the giants will have enough trust in will allen and will peterson to take their best cornerback jason sehorn away from his natural position and brazenly move him up and down the line of scrimmage trying to smother every rams option clearly these are not your father 's giants in a matter of weeks the giants defense ranked fifth in the league last season has been remade before our eyes whether the giants have enough experience or talent to gallop side by side with the st louis track team in helmets and shoulder pads is another matter but give the giants credit for boldly trying to change their spots on the run with teams passing more and receiving corps growing more versatile the giants drafted two cornerbacks in april then pushed them into starting roles on opening night last month dave thomas remember him he was supposed to battle allen for the left cornerback job for at least one season thomas held off allen for two quarters of one game peterson meanwhile has been promoted to the nickel cornerback the extra defensive back substituted in passing situations which puts peterson on the field for nearly 70 percent of the defensive plays the defensive coordinator john fox has confidently assigned allen and peterson to the corners of the field as each takes a receiver at the far end of the opposing formation sehorn shifts inside to cover the slot receiver who is often a smaller speedy receiver the 6 foot 2 inch 215 pound sehorn may be best against bigger receivers like randy moss and keyshawn johnson but sehorn is flexible enough to run with the shifty types too plus lining up so near the line of scrimmage sehorn is a threat to blitz it never hurts to have a fast clever and big defender eyeball to eyeball with the quarterback this alignment is not a permanent solution for the giants since they probably would prefer to have the 5 10 190 pound allen learn the inside role next season but for now it allows allen and peterson to worry about coverage assignments and techniques only on the outside where the sideline is your chief ally because things get far messier in the middle of the field shaun williams the free safety who may be on his way to a pro bowl season was required to play the slot receiver as the nickel cornerback in his first two seasons in the league it was n't fun williams said nobody likes to play that spot to tell you the truth sehorn whose self assurance runs so deep he could and did marry a television star angie harmon and still not feel as if his star was dimmed is not bothered by his new responsibilities he knows the slot receiver has emerged as a pivotal third down threat in the confusion of backpedaling defenders besides it is always a good idea to ask sehorn to do a tough job to accentuate sehorn 's skills and size which are virtually unparalleled at his position he must be challenged ask him to cover moss or michael westbrook as he did last sunday and sehorn raises his level of play give him a little known receiver to shadow baltimore 's brandon stokley comes to mind and his concentration may wander fox first hatched his new scheme for sehorn against kansas city as a way of stopping the chiefs pro bowl tight end tony gonzalez when it worked fox decided to let it ride last sunday sehorn more or less shut down westbrook in the regular defense and then shifted to the sneakier slot receiver kevin lockett during washington 's three receiver formations sehorn intercepted two passes tailing lockett who did not catch a pass sehorn an eight year veteran credited allen with his first interception sehorn felt free to roam on the play because allen as he stood at the line of scrimmage before the snap had confidently told sehorn that he did not need any help with his man who happened to be westbrook keep in mind that allen was playing only his fourth nfl game now the redskins receivers are not the rams receivers kurt warner of st louis is the top rated quarterback in the league allen and peterson will see complex and confusing pass patterns and formations the league 's most valuable player last season marshall faulk also lines up as a receiver allen and peterson in their nfl debuts did not exactly stop denver 's passing attack last month the rams passed for a record 5232 yards last season or more yards than the giants passed for in coach jim fassel 's first two seasons combined so the giants are significant underdogs and should be the giants have not waited to test their young players and maybe with an early start allen and peterson will have the seasoning to keep up with the league 's elite in january when the games mean the most they used to say that rookie cornerbacks were like rookie quarterbacks every good team should have one on the sideline the key is keeping them there that was a common practice for years but these are not your father 's giants
