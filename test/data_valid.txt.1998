under pressure from congress to explain lapses in oversight of gene therapy federal health officials acknowledged today that they could not be certain whether experiments had hastened or possibly caused the deaths of patients other than the 18 year old man who died at the university of pennsylvania last fall most gene therapy trials are done in people with life threatening or terminal illnesses dr jay p siegel a food and drug administration official told a senate subcommittee patients in those trials die it is usually not possible to make a definitive determination about what role gene therapy played in the deaths dr siegel made his remarks at a packed three and a half hour hearing before the subcommittee on public health that covered a variety of topics including whether scientists had been truthful in informing patients about the risks of gene therapy why why the fda and the national institutes of health had not shared information with each other the two agencies monitor the research at the conclusion senator bill frist the tennessee republican who is chairman of the subcommittee declared that the system for protecting patients was broken it 's a multisystem failure mr frist said adding we may have just touched the tip of the iceberg on among those testifying today was paul gelsinger the father of jesse gelsinger 18 whose death on sept 17 has been the only one as far as government officials know directly attributable to gene therapy in an impassioned at times tearful speech mr gelsinger who had defended the penn researchers as ethical men said he now feels he had been naive to have trusted them he called for an independent patients advocate to be present at discussions when risks are explained to patients considering taking part in medical experiments known as informed consent sessions he also attacked the influence of money from biotech companies in the race to making gene therapy work mr gelsinger described the death of his son as an avoidable tragedy from which i will never recover on jan 21 the fda shut down all gene therapy experiments at penn citing numerous deficiencies in the way the clinical trial was run including serious lapses in informed consent the penn scientists did not testify today but the university 's president dr judith rodin sent a letter saying penn takes the agency 's charges extremely seriously and will respond as soon as possible in gene therapy experiments scientists are trying to use dna to correct a wide variety of inherited disorders as well as cancer and heart diseases despite the technology 's promise the the 10 year old field has had relatively few successes and now mr gelsinger 's death may well slow the pace of research today representatives of the cystic fibrosis foundation said that in december they took the precautionary step of suspending two experiments in gene therapy that used adenovirus a deactivated cold virus that was used in the study that killed mr gelsinger one of those experiments was being conducted at pennsylvania one cystic fibrosis patient eric kast of norman okla told senators he worried that if the science slowed down too much a cure would come too late for him at 33 mr kast said he has lived one year longer than the average life expectancy for someone with his disease my battle with cf is a race he said do n't let me lose that race when the finish line might be just around the corner much of today 's discussion focused on why scientists have routinely ignored federal guidelines to report experiment side effects in patients to the national institutes of health in examining all 93 experiments that used adenovirus officials from the institutes recently discovered that of 691 side effects only 39 had been reported immediately to the institutes as federal rules require dr leroy walters a bioethics professor at georgetown university who testified today offered one explanation in 1996 the recombinant dna advisory committee the institutes panel that oversees gene therapy lost its authority to approve all research protocols the result he said is that scientists no longer take the committee seriously
