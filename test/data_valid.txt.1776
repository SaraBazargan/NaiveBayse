the sweeping changes announced by the fbi director robert s mueller iii last week constitute one of the most far reaching organizational transformations in the long history of the bureau which began in 1908 unfortunately creating new units hiring new people and announcing a new focus on fighting terrorism are destined to fail unless mr mueller can also transform the insular culture of the agency in that sense mr mueller 's treatment of coleen rowley the agent who called attention to the fbi 's failures in the zacarias moussaoui investigation is encouraging he thanked her for her courage in coming forward and assured her that her job is not in jeopardy as the result of her criticism but one act of candor and contrition by the director does not remake a culture the bureau will succeed in its new mission only if it can learn to value analysis as much as traditional criminal investigation there 's little doubt that the reorganization is necessary the shift in priorities from crime fighting the pursuit of bank robbers kidnappers mobsters and other high profile criminals to counterterrorism reflects the change in our national priorities some critics say the reorganization is a thinly veiled attempt to divert attention from all the recent negative publicity about the fbi but they 're wrong a shift in policies was inevitable after sept 11 those attacks proved the bureau and our other intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been ill equipped and too poorly organized to address the threats we face others question whether the policy changes are wise should the fbi be allowed to take on expanded duties involving the gathering of domestic intelligence there are legitimate concerns about the lifting of justice department restrictions on domestic spying given the abuses committed against religious and political groups during the j edgar hoover era but for better or worse the fbi is the agency that has to take the lead in domestic security not necessarily because it has shown striking success in the past but because no institutional alternative presents itself regardless of one 's view of the wisdom of mr mueller 's changes or the motivation behind them the main obstacles to carrying them out are features of institutional life within the fbi intelligence collection and analysis have long been undervalued in a culture that has celebrated the myth of the fbi agent crimefighter analysts assigned to cases have been the lowest people on the totem pole counterintelligence agents have been second class citizens compared to those in criminal investigation units virtually all of the powerful bosses of the fbi field offices around the country the special agents in charge come from investigative backgrounds elevating the status of analysis capabilities in an agency that has devalued that work will not be easy nor will the shift of the bureau 's mission be easy for the staff men and women who have chosen careers with the fbi have done so because to put it bluntly they want to lock up criminals agents have expected successful investigations to lead to prosecutions not to prevention of terrorist acts although the fbi will be hiring hundreds of new analysts turning the fbi around in the next few years will depend upon its current staff giving lip service to the bureau 's new mission will not be the problem the problem will be changing on the most practical level what the fbi does and what agents do on a daily basis the key question is whether and to what extent the fbi will become more open to ideas and criticism from within the agency and from the outside world the free and unfettered exchange of ideas and the willingness to challenge and question the way business is done are fundamental to a culture in which analysis is prized none of these qualities have been encouraged in the bureau 's history the fbi has not been an institution that accepts dissent its initial response to ms rowley 's bold letter was not to follow up on it but to classify it its standard approach to criticism was on display when over the course of many years the fbi ignored and denigrated frederic whitehurst the former fbi chemist when he made very serious charges of unscientific and deficient practices at the fbi crime lab many of which turned out to be accurate when i was inspector general of the justice department i was charged with investigating the bureau 's handling of the aldrich ames affair not only did the fbi oppose this review some fbi officials actually told members of the congressional staff that i was uninterested in conducting it and preferred to let the agency perform its own internal review the fbi ultimately cooperated with my office but only after desperate efforts to avoid the investigation the individuals who assisted on the investigation declined to have their names on the report that was viewed as a potential career ender when the report on the ames case was issued it was either dismissed or ignored by senior fbi officials one official said publicly that the report contained nothing new a comment that raised the question of whether the agency 's leaders had even read it mr mueller showed he is willing to change the approach when he quickly referred ms rowley 's complaints to the justice department 's inspector general an act that would have been considered extraordinary under his predecessors his good example is certainly important but altering the bureau 's culture will require a turnabout in the attitude of the entire fbi leadership one that permeates the whole agency creating new organizational boxes shifting manpower and expanding the size of the fbi will not make the public safer until this change is made michael r bromwich was inspector general of the justice department from 1994 to 1999
