sagging demand in north america and europe has led to fierce price cutting of stainless steel a metal prized for its resistance to corrosion its bright appearance and its easily cleaned surfaces the market in north america is about as weak as we 've seen it in 25 years said joseph gibbons chief executive of great plains stainless inc of tulsa okla which trades stainless steels used in breweries slaughterhouses and other industrial plants investment in equipment has fallen in the last three years lowering demand for raw materials according to american metal market a trade publication the price of one widely used type of stainless steel bar has sunk 16 percent in the last year the prices of cold rolled sheet used for appliances have fallen 3 percent to 4 percent yet as producers of stainless steel battle for sales the price of nickel one of its main ingredients is surging the london metal exchange 's three month nickel contract traded around 9575 a metric ton today up 70 percent since early january 2002 and 33 percent so far this year prices of stainless steel scrap an alternative raw material source have also climbed but with stainless steel making up about three quarters of nickel consumption the question is how long prices of the two materials can keep moving in opposite directions echoing many other analysts daniel a roling of merrill lynch in new york said he expected the nickel price to remain strong for at least the next three years the nickel market 's most recent lift has come from a continuing strike at the sudbury ontario operations of inco ltd the western world 's biggest nickel producer the strike which began june 1 amid a dispute over pensions and health care benefits has idled about 9 percent of western production capacity inco 's global operations account for 19 percent of the world 's nickel supplies and 26 percent of supplies for the western world but the surge in nickel prices also reflects fears of a looming and long lasting supply squeeze the shortage stems in part from three projects in western australia that came onstream in the late 1990 's using a new extraction process known as high pressure acid leaching the technology has turned out to be a disappointment with both production and costs missing their targets robert way principal base metals analyst at the sydney office of ame mineral economics an independent research concern said that the prospect of rising production from these projects had discouraged other nickel producers from moving ahead with new mines a deficit has opened up and it 's going to stay that way mr way said in a recent phone interview two big inco projects one at voisey 's bay in labrador and another at goro in the french territory of new caledonia are not scheduled to start production before 2006 inco which is based in toronto suspended construction work at goro last december after the projected cost of the project jumped as much as 40 percent to 21 billion the company said last week that it had identified savings of 225 million but that further cost cuts and financial assistance from the french government were still needed for the mine to go ahead the voisey 's bay project is proceeding on schedule anticipating a supply shortfall nickel producers stock prices have risen sharply in recent months even inco 's which are up 23 percent since the strike began closing at 2514 in new york today but the share prices of stainless steel producers have been languishing as the companies remain caught between spiraling costs and slumping demand besides higher nickel prices they have complained of rising energy costs and adverse currency movements slater steel inc which is based in mississauga ontario and has mills in the united states and canada sought protection from creditors earlier this summer and warned last week of a heavy second quarter loss slater said it would have to write down the value of its stainless steel inventory to reflect manufactured costs in excess of net realizable values the industry rule of thumb said mr gibbons of great plains stainless is that profits shrink by 5 percent for every 1 percent drop in volume demand in europe for stainless steel has also shrunk in recent months markus a moll senior analyst at smr steel and metals market research of reutte austria estimates that european stainless steel mills have cut third quarter production by about 10 percent by extending summer maintenance shutdowns furthermore mr moll said in an e mail message many mills have indicated they will trim nickel purchases for the rest of the year demand for nickel has so far been buoyed by a torrent of new stainless steel mills around the world with new capacity of more than three million metric tons in 2002 and 2003 combined north american stainless a unit of acerinox sa of spain for instance started up a big new hot rolling mill in carrollton ky in may in addition demand has remained strong in asia especially in china which in 2001 became the world 's biggest stainless steel user overtaking the united states and japan china still imports about three quarters of its stainless steel needs scott hand inco 's chairman recently told analysts that the company expected chinese consumption to keep growing 10 percent to 20 percent a year until at least 2006 still mr moll said that both nickel and stainless steel markets could be in for a bumpy ride over the next few months even china will have a year of consolidation he said richard m ubinger chief financial officer of universal stainless and alloy products inc of bridgeville pa said he saw no sign for now of a sustainable improvement in the stainless steel market universal a relatively small producer reported a second quarter loss and revenues that were down 21 percent from the period a year earlier but many analysts including mr moll say prospects should brighten in 2004 they cite low inventories and the expectation that demand from the construction and automotive industries will rise as the american and european economies accelerate should these forecasts prove correct by next summer stainless steel and nickel prices could be moving in the same direction up
