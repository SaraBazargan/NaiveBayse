peter laviolette the islanders new coach has a wife and two kids and he dresses so immaculately for games and sweats so little that he looks as if he could go out for a power lunch afterward that is his suburban dad side his other side is much more visceral ben hur lurks within him every now and then laviolette 36 the former defenseman who spent almost all of his career in the minor leagues talks about how he wants his players to rip out their hearts and wear them on their sleeves for the team he does not mean that literally of course but this is his blunt way of pounding home a point and he pounds it home a lot the islanders with an 11 1 1 1 record entering thursday 's home game against the rangers have succeeded by being aggressive and daring the acquisitions of goaltender chris osgood and centers michael peca and aleksei yashin have been important but so has the installation of laviolette 's system which is rich in minutiae but is by no means passive the results have been startling the islanders are 7 1 on the road they needed 31 road games last season to win 7 one sixth into the season they are 10 0 against teams from the eastern conference and 3 0 against teams from the atlantic division they won 18 games all of last season against eastern conference teams and 7 against atlantic division opponents they have won two games this season in which they trailed going into the third period they won one all of last season they are 4 0 on the second night of back to back games they won only three games on the second night of back to back sets last season there are 60 minutes in a game and we 're trying not to take any of them off said shawn bates the industrious left wing on peca 's line that seems to be their anthem this is not to say that the islanders have been reckless the way our system is you always have backup defenseman adrian aucoin said they are simply sweating the details the islanders for example are the second best team in the national hockey league at killing penalties but they are not satisfied merely to let opponents camp out in the islanders zone while on the power play and whack away at osgood we already have motion in our defensive zone laviolette said it just carries through to scoring chances the islanders have scored four short handed goals this season tied with detroit for the best in the league the islanders had nine short handed goals all of last season during one short handed situation in tuesday 's 3 0 triumph over tampa bay jason blake single handedly kept the puck in the lightning end of the rink for nearly 30 seconds he almost scored a short handed goal later we just do n't give them time to set up said claude lapointe the veteran center the islanders aggressive approach shows up in other more subtle ways gruntwork laviolette has placed a premium on winning battles for loose pucks the islanders are in the top 10 in the league in takeaways and giveaways they also win their share of face offs dave scatchard and lapointe have each won more than 56 percent of their face offs playing mostly on the third and fourth lines a year after scoring 21 goals a career high scatchard has only one goal this year and is not playing as much because of the acquisitions of peca and yashin it 's a little tough to get the numbers up there he said but as long as i can play well defensively the coaches will be satisfied everybody wants to play a ton but sometimes you 've got to take a back seat and play another role fisticuffs the islanders do not have a designated enforcer as some other teams have but that does not mean they can not fight or will not fight tampa bay goaded the islanders into two fights tuesday and steve webb won the first and eric cairns won the second i do n't think we 've been pushed around at all by any teams laviolette said the islanders record in fights will not be as excellent as say muhammad ali 's and the team might acquire someone later who can throw harder punches but laviolette does not want his players to shy away from anyone there is a carry over effect the way webby plays every shift he 's out there he gives us momentum aucoin said the hot hand laviolette has said that he will award playing time to those who have earned it and he wants to have a deep balanced roster but he knows that his top shelf talent can win him the most games he does not profess to be worried about a backlash osgood has missed only one game yashin double shifted during the tampa bay game and peca played more than 25 minutes in contrast islanders defenseman ken sutton one of the devils steadiest players in the stanley cup finals last season has been ineffective and has been a healthy scratch for four straight games laviolette puts his players in position where they can be the most effective mark parrish the islanders scoring leader with 12 goals is great at tipping pucks on a power play so laviolette has him playing in front of the goal even though parrish is neither tall nor beefy on tuesday he tipped a puck on the power play and tampa bay goaltender nikolai khabibulin stopped it but the tip was just hard enough that khabibulin was unable to smother it and bates slammed in the rebound sometimes you get them sometimes you do n't bates said but when you do get them you 've got to make sure you bury it extra padding osgood acquired in the waiver draft in september has been the islanders most valuable player so far this season it is hard to guess how many games he has won for them or to figure where the islanders would be with garth snow or rick dipietro their original goalies there has always been one stretch of every game though when osgood is needed the philadelphia flyers had a two man advantage for 1 minute 41 seconds in the islanders 2 1 victory saturday and osgood stopped several flurries of shots opponents are 0 for 7 against the islanders with a two man advantage this season there appears to be a carry over to the rest of the team osgood in the words of the coach rips his heart out and carries it on his sleeve those in front of him play with more confidence that 's what i love about this team scatchard said it does n't matter if we 're up a goal or down a goal or have a two man disadvantage with three minutes to go in the game this team never quits
