the most significant antitrust case in decades and one of the epic courtroom battles of our time seem to have drawn to an anticlimactic close judge colleen kollar kotelly 's ruling on friday upholding the settlement reached last november by microsoft the federal government and nine states was the proper one nine other states challenging the settlement largely on behalf of microsoft competitors failed to make a convincing case that the judge should radically alter its terms we say this admittedly with some dread the settlement appears to be in the public interest but enforcing the decree 's terms so as to prevent microsoft from again abusing its windows computer operating system monopoly to thwart competition will prove a daunting challenge the five year consent decree is tailored to curb the type of behavior deemed illegal both at trial and by a federal appeals court microsoft will no longer be allowed to use the terms of its windows licensing deals to threaten or punish computer makers and others who might favor competing products as it once did to undermine netscape 's internet browser once easily cowed by microsoft computer manufacturers are now free to bundle windows with applications and other software that compete with microsoft products without fear of retaliation companies like sony ibm and dell are starting to exercise this power but the court and the justice department must zealously police this provision enforcement will also be crucial in requiring that microsoft share its windows programming code with developers of competing applications such as browsers or media players the judge also imposed on microsoft the burden of creating a compliance committee of board members microsoft and its investors are clearly relieved to have avoided the company 's dismemberment or other draconian remedies but given the continuing inquiries into its business practices by the european union and judge kollar kotelly 's great discretion in policing this decree the company would be well advised to abide by the spirit and not just the letter of the settlement
