leap of faith memoirs of an unexpected life by queen noor illustrated 467 pages miramax books 2595 not long after the former lisa halaby married king hussein of jordan in 1978 she was asked by an american interviewer whether the couple planned to have children together she replied if god wills to what she regarded as a casual inquiry only to find people magazine running a story titled a blue jeaned american in jordan says of her king 'i 'd be delighted to have his child not surprisingly 25 years later the widowed queen noor prefers to speak for herself but leap of faith will not dispel its author 's impression that she has often been misunderstood on one hand this is a glossy and decorous account of the queen 's unusual experiences with a polite tendency to accentuate the positive i urged everyone i worked with to speak freely and offer honest constructive criticism on the other it is a fiery account of her husband 's frustrations in dealing with international diplomacy in general and the united states and israel in particular as an american born jordanian of half arab ancestry the queen surely has an idiosyncratic overview and she has a long memory for anti arab slights what is a najeeb elias halaby animal vegetable or mineral she remembers once reading in a washington newspaper as it made joking reference to her lebanese father in fact he was then the head of the federal aviation administration and his expertise would eventually bring him into contact with jordan 's ruler why do n't i see more of you king hussein asked the blushing lisa halaby at an early meeting without going into great detail queen noor whose least favorite phrase in english seems to be storybook romance and who does not treat her memoir as one mentions one lunch date that lasted six hours she also mentions that the king an abba fan wooed her with a rendition of that group 's song take a chance on me marriage to king hussein meant not only eight stepchildren she was his fourth wife but also intense revisionism of her american attitudes toward the middle east now she would regard lawrence of arabia as a film with a racist subtext and consider 1948 the year the state of israel was founded as the year of the catastrophe and she would continue to be shocked throughout a life of extensive travel and diplomacy by the dismissive and indiscriminate ways in which arabs were described abroad at the time of the first gulf war she was amazed when president george bush told her husband speaking of saddam hussein i will not allow this little dictator to control 25 percent of the civilized world 's oil the key words here for the jordanians who would later describe this meeting in kennebunkport me as quite a raw experience were of course civilized world in a book whose guess who 's coming to dinner anecdotes involve couples like the qaddafis the author 's closely observed knowledge of middle eastern leaders is particularly important the saddam hussein to be found in these pages and the rise in his popularity among jordanians of palestinian descent warrant a close look the queen maintains that her husband 's attempts at diplomacy might well have persuaded the iraqi leader to withdraw his forces from kuwait but that this peace effort was sabotaged this undercutting of king hussein 's mission to achieve an iraqi commitment on withdrawal would bring western troops into the region and sow the seeds of radical islamist terrorist attacks on the united states more than a decade later she writes leap of faith with the author 's royalties to be donated to a charitable foundation named for king hussein quotes chillingly enduring words from the iraqi ruler yes the whole world is against me but god is with me and i will be victorious the queen says that saddam hussein told her husband at the same time while maintaining that europeans equate war with devastation she cites the prevailing american and israeli view that armed confrontation and the civilian deaths and destruction of infrastructure that accompanied it were necessary evils in the exercise of national security aims as someone whose seaside home in aqaba was so close to the israeli border that her household pets would make their way to the barbed wire there queen noor frequently assails zionism the building of israeli settlements and the perceived power of american jews in influencing these matters she reports that in one instance as she challenged the american film industry 's stereotypical treatment of arabs as terrorists or oil rich gluttons as religious fanatics or primitive beings she had the realization that many studio executives were jewish deeply loyal to israel and israeli politics right or wrong the queen reserves her harshest judgments for the manner in which king hussein felt himself manipulated and misrepresented during middle east peace negotiations she is especially incensed by the way negotiations between her husband and yitzhak rabin were co opted by washington and by the power of the american israel public affairs committee to lobby against the arab world 's interests intermingled with these observations is the queen 's glowing portrait of her marriage which ended with the king 's death in 1999 but this is a book in which eight stepchildren along with queen noor 's four children with king hussein yield only a page or two of family friction leap of faith also addresses the progress made for women in jordan during queen noor 's tenure it is true that the queen helped to organize a handicrafts initiative so that the making of colorful rugs would provide work and income for women raising families at home it is also true that under jordanian law it remained legal for a man with an adulterous wife or female relative to kill her without being penalized there were inequities too says this smooth talking volume to be sure
