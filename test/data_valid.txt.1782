to the editor many of us have fond memories of the gotham book mart in manhattan arts pages july 24 back in 1969 i was browsing in the poetry section and came across kenneth koch 's when the sun tries to go on with cover design and illustrations by larry rivers and published by black sparrow press in los angeles the fabulous three dimensional cover did it for me and i bought the book on the spot this was my introduction to black sparrow and for 32 years i have been an avid collector of that press and of books that exemplify the art of the book i can truly say the gotham got me started in those directions we can be a bit nostalgic about the old building on west 47th street but i think that many of us are also looking forward to the same spirit of the gotham in a new location where much of the collection is out in the open for us to see maybe this move will lead to a new generation of book collectors in a city that once had so many stores selling used and antiquarian books and now has so few allen cohen santa barbara calif july 24 2001
