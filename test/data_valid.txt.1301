last week the security chief at new york 's metropolitan transportation authority suddenly accused his own agency of corruption the mta leadership then suspended him with pay and it is hard to determine at this early stage whether new yorkers are watching an internal feud or an unfolding scandal getting any real information will not be easy the mta is a huge remote patch of new york 's expanding shadow government it is one of more than 50 authorities corporations or other entities that are off budget which means the public and even the legislature have almost no access to their secret doings these authorities worth billions are controlled almost exclusively by gov george pataki and the public seldom gets even the barest glimpse of how they operate one of those rare moments occurs at the monthly meeting of the public authorities control board which assesses the debt of many authorities its march meeting was not encouraging set for wednesday afternoons in an unmarked room in the state capitol the control board generally draws about a dozen attendees a few minutes before the march session started a representative of governor pataki 's budget office explained that most items would be put off until the next morning what remained approving a series of bonds for the long island power authority was quick and easy the meeting lasted 12 minutes the next day in a virtually empty capitol building the board met again of the 11 people in the room only 3 were members of the public the outsiders were given no clue in advance about the purpose of the meeting for thursday 's 11 am session the agenda was available to the public at 11 02 am the meeting approved millions of dollars in bonds although it was impossible for a spectator to tell exactly how much or what they were for the meeting ended after 14 minutes some authorities including the gigantic mta are exempt from even the control board 's minimal public oversight the first of these bodies were set up more than 30 years ago as a way to create revenue backed bonds and avoid meddling from the bureaucracy or the legislature since then they have essentially cloned themselves creating subauthorities and offshoots that do everything from promoting horse breeding to building schools and running the thruways and harbors in a huge network of secretive state businesses assemblyman richard brodsky chairman of the committee on authorities has announced hearings on these clandestine state operations as have vincent leibell his senate counterpart and nicholas spano chairman of the senate investigations committee it is a sign of the dysfunctional nature of albany that legislators can not work together in soliciting testimony on such a complex financial mess but the legislature and governor pataki somehow need to make these authority budgets transparent they require more independent oversight more independent audits and an overseer that is more open and rigorous than the public authorities control board in the meantime the state constitution allows the comptroller alan hevesi to peer into the authorities secret vaults and he has made a good start subpoenaing the mta to get detailed budget data the first batch of papers arrived in a truckload and it is taking a lot of effort for the comptroller to dig his way out but mr hevesi and his auditors should keep exploring this parallel universe new yorkers deserve to know what financial business is being done in their name fixing albany editorials in this series remain online at nytimescom albany
