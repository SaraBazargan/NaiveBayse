the nation 's labor leaders gathering in los angeles tomorrow for the afl cio 's winter meeting will devote much of their time to trying to figure out how to respond to the change in the political winds in washington that has put them on the defensive labor unions bet heavily on former vice president al gore in the presidential race and now president bush and a republican led congress are moving quickly to undo labor backed measures adopted in the clinton years already for instance the bush administration has suspended regulations adopted by president bill clinton and eagerly sought by labor that would forbid awarding federal contracts to companies that violate labor laws obviously the election of bush creates a significant negative environment for unions said richard hurd a labor relations professor at cornell university they put a tremendous amount of effort into the gore campaign and they were probably more effective than they 've ever been politically but now the labor movement could get punished for that their effectiveness raised their visibility and the ire of their political opponents despite the political reversals union leaders say they will take the offensive on many issues like a higher minimum wage and many union officials insist that labor is stronger now than five years ago when the movement often seemed voiceless and toothless but mr gore 's loss was not the only recent setback after unions boasted that they had reversed a decades long decline in membership the bureau of labor statistics reported last month that just 135 percent of the work force belonged to unions the smallest percentage in six decades and down from a peak of 35 percent in the 1950 's the economic slowdown is expected to make it harder for unions to reverse the decline partly because corporations facing lower demand for their products often shut down their unionized operations first in addition unions have made little headway in their efforts to organize high tech workers the communications workers of america tried for more than a year to unionize 400 customer service representatives at amazoncom in seattle not only did that effort fail but amazon announced two weeks ago that it was laying off most of those workers in a lot of ways labor 's up against it said patrick j cleary vice president for human resources policy at the national association of manufacturers you look at where the growth is in this country in terms of jobs and in terms of population it 's in industries like finance and high tech and in geographical regions like the south where labor has been historically weak but union leaders insist that they are not going to play defense they promise to press congress for a higher minimum wage a patients bill of rights and a medicare benefit for prescription drugs and they plan to lobby state legislatures to extend health coverage to more uninsured families 'our two biggest priorities said denise mitchell the afl cio 's communications director will be staying focused on organizing because long term growth is essential for us and moving a proactive legislative agenda despite mr bush 's victory and the decline in union membership officials of the afl cio argue that the labor movement 's power is waxing not waning they cite its major role in november 's election asserting that without labor 's support for mr gore mr bush would have won easily and that mr gore would have lost crucial swing states including wisconsin pennsylvania and michigan they also point to surveys showing that 26 percent of voters came from union households the labor movement is in much better shape than it was five years ago in terms of political action doing more organizing and mobilizing activists ms mitchell said we did a terrific job in the elections in state after state and we plan to build on that but republicans have something else in mind urged on by many republicans in congress mr bush has repeatedly said he will back legislation that would make it far easier for union members to stop paying the part of their dues that goes to political activities such legislation could badly deplete labor 's campaign coffers it 's important that rank and file union members have control over where their money goes when it 's not used for union activities said representative john a boehner republican of ohio who is chairman of the house committee on education and the work force mr bush is also drafting rules to reverse a labor backed clinton policy that often gave unionized firms priority on federally financed construction projects and the republicans say they will push for legislation opposed by labor to require overtime pay only for work exceeding 80 hours in two weeks instead of 40 hours in a week beating back these continued small scale anti union initiatives is going to occupy a lot of the afl cio 's time and energy said robert b reich a former secretary of labor but labor leaders say they are confident that they have enough republican allies in congress to block major anti union initiatives asserting that labor 's most important long term goal is to increase its ranks john j sweeney the afl cio 's president is prodding the organization 's 66 unions to organize a million workers a year that compares with fewer than 400000 last year and fewer than 100000 in 1995 the year mr sweeney became the afl cio 's president there is a growing sense among union leaders that the fate of the labor movement depends on them and not on who controls the white house or congress i do n't think there 's any question we do n't have enough workers said andrew l stern president of service employees international union the nation 's fastest growing union the organizing numbers from last year say we have to accelerate what 's a very difficult process or else our ability to improve the lives of our members and working families is going to be very limited
