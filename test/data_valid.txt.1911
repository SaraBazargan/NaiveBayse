to the editor how absurd and how shortsighted can a world class telephone company become if it allows the splitting of a telephone exchange 528 and 526 for example into two different area codes 915 and 845 we in the 528 exchange will have to think whether our neighbors next door or down the block are in putnam county or in westchester county it would be intelligent to make a rule that a telephone exchange can not be split into two different area codes why does n't bell atlantic just have us write two checks one to 914 and one to 845 for our schizophrenic telephone service harry k movchine putnam valley
