richard kessel 's comment in could long island disconnect and avoid future blackouts aug 24 that anyone who thinks there is a way to isolate long island either permanently or in an emergency from what 's happening in the rest of the world is kidding themselves appears quite reasonable at the time of the aug 14 blackout total demand on long island was 4589 megawatts requiring that 600 to 700 megawatts be supplied from the six interconnections linking long island to the regional grid however mr kessel ignores long island 's nimby legacy much of which was spearheaded in the 1980 's and 90 's by mr kessel himself it was his amalgam of environmental organizations that led the fight to close the shoreham nuclear power plant with shoreham we might not have chosen to separate entirely from the grid but its 840 megawatts would have allowed us to restore full power to the island after we severed existing connections the closure of shoreham wherein long island ratepayers bought then closed an unused nuclear plant that had already been completed and licensed for operation was unprecedented nationwide today long island lacks energy self sufficiency and continues to pay among the highest electric rates in the nation mr kessel and his peers were adamant that shoreham be dismantled rather than mothballed so there is no bringing shoreham back badly needed and environmentally kind as it would have been nuclear plants generate no carbon dioxide or other airborne effluents an opinion essay in the same section tough choices ahead after the blackout by desmond ryan tells us what we already know fighting every solution is no solution but if we can not be mature enough to make decisions that are in our collective best interest then giving the federal energy regulatory commission the authority to make them for us as suggested by mr ryan begins to make sense david berwald centerport
