joel howard and tracy tucker both 40 are partners co workers and texans they come from proud suburban driving central air loving families from houses with big yards and bigger garages their move to new york three months ago mr tucker said was as extreme a culture shock as you can have without learning a new language six months or so before mr howard and mr tucker were just settling down in chicago where mr tucker 's employer the chubb group of insurance companies had transferred him from dallas a year and a half earlier duty called again with a proposed relocation to chubb 's new york city office hearts sank not new york the two had already mentally downsized for the chicago move they had bought a little bungalow in the andersonville section a bit smaller than their rambling dallas ranch house but it had a yard for their two dogs and they had a buick a real texas boat mr tucker said though we left the ford expedition in dallas but the company 's offers were seductive mr howard who had worked in advertising was hired by chubb and trained as an appraiser mr tucker is an assistant vice president at the company they hung a for sale sign on the bungalow and the search for a new york home began we knew we wanted a condo said mr tucker who had heard of new york 's notoriously fickle and prying co op boards from an online corporate relocation service called the intrepid new yorker indeed a visit to the site wwwintrepidnycom reveals advice that is unvarnished and daunting in service to the notion that harsh truths are best taken neat and fast with no chaser here 's how the service describes the new york real estate scene in addition to the prohibitively high cost of apartments and the small spaces we are expected to call home the playing field is never level the rules the description continues can be confusing archaic sometimes infuriating even demoralizing in any case mr howard and mr tucker were not demoralized though they considered themselves duly warned we knew we wanted a new york experience anyway but with a little more space mr tucker said and i knew i wanted central air i guess that 's the texan in me online they discovered dumbo the brooklyn waterfront neighborhood nestled between the brooklyn and manhattan bridges the acronym is by now familiar down under the manhattan bridge overpass and so too is a bit of its history as a thriving commercial district until the turn of the 20th century and the birthplace of corrugated cardboard and with a postindustrial life in the late 20th century as a haven for artists pursuing space and light and fleeing the high rents of soho and tribeca hot on their heels and this bit is maybe familiar too was the developer david walentas whose two trees management company snatched up 11 buildings in dumbo in 1981 and to whom is given the sometimes dubious sometimes admiring credit for single handedly carving out a commercial and residential neighborhood from the distinctive warehouse buildings at the edge of the east river the company now owns 13 buildings there the sweeney building at 30 main street a 12 story former nickel and silver plating factory and maker of nickelware teapots among other things is the latest two trees conversion prices for its lofts with 11 foot ceilings viking stoves and subzero fridges range from 485000 for a 1270 square foot one bedroom to 24 million for a 2474 square foot duplex with what the developers call a rooftop cabana 500 square feet of open rooftop riverside space complete with running water and electricity and fenced with ipe a dense chocolate colored wood from brazil there are four of these super duplexes six solo cabanas were sold separately to building residents for 175000 each of the 87 units in the building 16 are still unsold during a four hour whirlwind visit to new york last february mr howard and mr tucker received their new assignments toured properties in park slope and brooklyn heights and concluded the day by signing a contract for 750000 on a two bedroom loft in the sweeney building with almost 1500 square feet and central air turns out you can see the building from their new offices in lower manhattan back in chicago they packed up a u haul with a steer skull garden furniture concrete statuary a rather impressive rock collection and half their belongings and drove it 1100 miles back to storage in dallas what remained including family heirlooms like a bedroom set from the 30 's came to rest in dumbo mr howard and mr tucker took to new york life with more gusto than they had anticipated mr howard calls the subway the big silver limousine and has an endless appetite for riding it i just stare and stare he said and i love just getting off at a station and seeing what 's up there if i do n't like what i see i head back down and keep going in three months he has worn the soles out on his black oxfords i just replaced them he said brandishing a shoe they found a costco warehouse on third avenue in brooklyn and make pilgrimages on saturday in a beat up green 1971 dodge station wagon with wood paneling you have to have at least one car mr howard explained note to manhattanites dumbo 's street parking rules require that cars shift only once a week a giant box of velveeta shells and cheese was a recent find happily the efforts of cultural institutions in the area like arts at st ann 's whose warehouse was host to the wooster group earlier this year and the dumbo arts center are just as aggressive as the commercial ones on a recent sultry summer evening in fulton ferry park rehearsals were under way for 10 stories a humble offering to the manhattan skyline from 'scape a not for profit performing arts company a couple of youngsters were playing softball behind a little knoll of russian olive trees and an enormous beech tree on the river beyond bateaux celestial a 200 foot parisian river barge glided by inside the sweeney building mr howard and mr tucker were settling in for the evening and pondering the future i do n't know that i 'd ever move back to texas mr howard said as he obligingly ran a delinting roller brush from costco over a visitor 's black pants erasing the furry residue from the attentions of brittany faye a 10 year old blonde cocker spaniel brittany 's adjustment to city life has been painless mr howard said for virgil otis however a 4 year old rescued greyhound the elevator ride is still a hurdle he just locks up mr howard said and if the two men have a dinner out after work virgil will eat the mail in protest wherever the tide takes us is how i feel about the next step mr howard said when we moved to chicago i thought 'at least it 's not new york i thought 'we need space and there 's not enough there mr tucker broke in quickly bristling like any new yorker but you 've got central park he said you 've got fulton ferry what more could you want
