new england whose team colors include red white and blue was professional football 's patriotic symbol and champion last season the patriots championship embodied a country at war a team that coalesced in the postseason to claim the seemingly unattainable a stretch offering a snow filled victory over oakland a special teams delight over pittsburgh and a chilling kick in the last seconds over st louis if ever a team was charmed the prevailing thought went this was the team you heard it from fans and players and other observers but you heard it most from the patriots coaching and ownership peers as the nfl season unfolded last week that group often began talking about new england this way well everybody knows the patriots were n't the best team last year but their leap from last place in their division in 2000 to the top of the league a season later gave every team hope for this season fluke was a word often linked to the patriots last year and that is why so many people did not pick them to win their division this season and why even more predicted they would be looking in from the outside when the playoffs arrive in january this served as the backdrop for new england 's smashing 30 14 victory over pittsburgh on monday night in the patriots new home sparkling gillette stadium with championship rings on their fingers and the barrage of doubt from others circling over their heads they played a possessed game an emotional one too and delivered an impressive opening performance they forced five steelers turnovers and put so much pressure on pittsburgh that it melted mentally and committed 13 penalties for 112 yards new england generated a 17 0 third quarter barrage that turned a game it led at halftime by 10 7 into a laugher the patriots squeezed pittsburgh 's offense stretched its defense claimed the special teams battles and watched quarterback tom brady 29 of 43 for 294 yards 3 touchdowns and no interceptions play loose and daringly and relentlessly pierce pittsburgh it said plenty about new england that it was eager to put so much of this opening game squarely into brady 's hands it said more about the patriots that in this setting with a free fall routinely expected that they could rise and then soar and clearly in just one game erase so much doubt and earn so much respect i think right now you have to say they are the team to beat in the afc and in the league pittsburgh running back jerome bettis said you have to give them their due undoubtedly the jets are doing so they will play new england at giants stadium on sunday and they will spend this week preparing for a club that is clearly the cream of the american football conference east a hungry team that was not spoiled by its super bowl success that has been the trend in recent seasons teams win the super bowl one year and get fat and lazy and overconfident and dawdle around into mediocrity the next one but we 're a humble group of guys patriots receiver david patten said cornerback otis smith said some people talk for their confidence and that 's what they do to get themselves going pittsburgh did that they said they should have been the team from the afc in the super bowl we just go out and stay united and do what we do they do a lot of things on defense they give opponents so many different reads and looks before the ball is snapped and more complex ones after the snap that opposing offenses look confused more than one pittsburgh player said that he saw defensive alignments monday night that he had never seen before linemen dropping and linebackers blitzing and safeties and cornerbacks rotating all providing pure pressure on offense the patriots are daring unafraid to be as creative in their sets and calls as they are on defense at one point monday night the patriots ran 25 consecutive pass plays their special teams are sound and they proved in the second half that they were the better conditioned team they have an infusion of new talent among others the free agent safety victor green formerly of the jets was superb and the rookie receiver deion branch was astounding in their patriots debuts put it together and the patriots execution in the first game of the season on all fronts was mesmerizing coach bill belichick and his staff have the players ears and minds and the patriots never seem to forget that after all this is football their games will always be heavily physical one of our goals was to come out against pittsburgh and step on them cornerback ty law said they have a reputation for being a physical team now you have to mention us in the same breath we played this game knowing that in the back of our minds we are the champions that means a lot in tough situations because you can rely on the fact that you 've done it before and you can do it again several super bowl champions have been unable to separate that fine line between returning as champions yet not relying on the previous year to automatically assume success in the first game the patriots mastered that understanding beautifully when challenged as the season continues that will be their test to continue to perform while understanding that in a new season a new championship must be won they seem to get the message now the rest of the league gets a resounding one about the patriots too we 're a complete team linebacker willie mcginest said this is n't a thing built around three or four guys but a true team concept we 've got to believe we can improve and our best is yet to come that is no joke no fluke
