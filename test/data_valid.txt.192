dear mr clinton i hear you might host a television talk show congratulations but before you put on your lavaliere mike and your earpiece and slick back that roguish mane of gray hair here 's some advice i offer as a former host of a nighttime talk show as the potential host of an upcoming daytime talker and as a former toiler in the white house first of all on a talk show the host has to let someone else talk even an informed lovable former president does not get to talk the whole time are you prepared to let the woman whose husband has left her for a younger man the sex expert the makeover stylist or the free trade economist be the center of attention that yearly salary of almost 50 million does n't seem like so much now does it it is for the record about 100 times more than what i am supposed to be paid for my daytime show but then you are 100 times more famous and have about 100 times more hair than i do second as the network has probably told you daytime talk shows are aimed primarily at women this means you provide these women with tips on their health and their looks and their finances you make them feel as if you are their advocate the way phil donahue did in years past and still does you give them hope and information and a touch of excitement but in general you do not get to spend time with them third on television with a busy schedule of gang taping lots of shows far in advance so you can still be the headline act at those big bucks real estate seminars in shanghai you have to show up on time not on bct bill clinton time which is two hours late if you get the union crew into overtime and then double time and then golden time something like triple overtime you get into serious trouble do you really want to get into trouble with people who are paying you 50 million not that i 'm obsessed with this figure if these problems do n't faze you you may be perfect for the job after all the essence of daytime talk is to feel the audience 's pain and we know you are the maestro there a large part of this gig is just being a sexy and sympathetic man of a certain age and you 've got that locked up until my show starts that is so you might want to think up some gimmicks start your own book club for example resist the temptation to assign earth in the balance i just want to warn you that once you start earning 50 million did i mention that amount already you 're going to start to wonder why you have to keep working at all trust me you have to so go for it your program may yet be the ultimate reality show about death and resurrection just please leave a few million viewers for me ben stein a writer and actor is the host of win ben stein 's money
