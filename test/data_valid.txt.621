several years ago dr peter m meyer and his colleagues asked a large group of menopausal women how many of them were bothered by forgetfulness every hand in the room went up he recalled but tests conducted over several years turned up no evidence to support the idea that menopause actually interfered with memory according to an article released yesterday the study which was published in the journal neurology involved 803 women who had not yet reached menopause or were in early stages when the research began once a year the women were tested on their ability to repeat long strings of numbers backward and to identify pairs of symbols and digits quickly dr meyer and his colleagues at rush presbyterian st luke 's medical center in chicago expected to find the scores dropping instead the scores rose slightly for all of the women in the group menopausal or not dr meyer offered two explanations he cited a study that used brain scanners to show that estrogen taken by menopausal women increased activity in the part of the brain devoted to verbal memory the women 's test scores were not higher but changes in the pattern of activation could explain why they felt as if their memories were less efficient another explanation is that menopause often coincides with other circumstances that bring on stress like children reaching adolescence and parents reaching old age since stress can lead to minor lapses in memory women going through menopause may have a hard time determining whether it is a result of the transition or whether it is related to role stress dr meyer said
