the richard rodgers reader edited by geoffrey block illustrated 356 pages oxford university press 3250 in the centenary of richard rodgers 's birth one lingering question is how the composer could have written so brilliantly in collaboration with two such different and distinctive lyricists lorenz hart and oscar hammerstein ii did he submerge his musical personality or did he instill hart and hammerstein with his own spirit the richard rodgers reader edited by geoffrey block a useful and informative anthology of essays interviews and criticism drawn from a diversity of published and unpublished sources offers clues about this and other aspects of rodgers 's career rodgers wrote show tunes except for his occasional symphonic work as in his score for victory at sea songs that were integral to musicals onstage and less frequently on screen hundreds of his more than 1000 songs became standards but they were not written to stand alone no matter who the lyricist was the songs had rodgers 's signature which was both sophisticated and romantic and irrepressibly melodic i once asked him if he had ever forgotten any of his songs and he answered that he had forgotten verses but not songs as he said i recognize the style it is not always as easy as one might think to differentiate between those songs he did with hart and those with hammerstein it was hart who wrote with a song in my heart which with its throbbing emotion is a cousin to hammerstein 's i 'll never walk alone and it was hammerstein who wrote the gentleman is a dope which has hart like wit and cynicism hart and hammerstein were of course opposites in temperament and method of work with hart the music came first then the lyrics the reverse was true with the more disciplined hammerstein a primary difference was in the choice of material to musicalize and to dramatize rodgers was the link between the two lyricists and also between their two forms of theater the brashness and insouciance of the musicals in the first half of his career the idealism of those in the second half rodgers was in fact unpredictable and at times experimental the two most obvious examples being pal joey and oklahoma each a groundbreaker in the musical form the first by having a heel as hero the second by so integrating song story and dance in his book mr block prints brooks atkinson 's two contradictory responses to pal joey his suggestion in his original 1940 review in the new york times that one can not draw sweet water from a foul well and the enthusiasm with which he embraced everything about the 1952 revival in some cases time had to catch up to rodgers he went his own way with scant regard for fashion as stated in a 1938 time magazine cover story on rodgers and hart for the team the one possible formula was do n't have a formula the one rule for success do n't follow it up taking his own advice rodgers shifted starting his career with a burst of creativity from 1925 to 1930 he and hart wrote the scores for 16 musicals and revues then with his second collaborator he found new inspiration writing about the american west a carnival roustabout carousel his personal favorite a schoolteacher in siam and world war ii in the south pacific in an excerpt from his book ca n't help singin the american musical on stage and screen gerald mast says that these four shows sought to define exactly what america meant and americans believed and dealt with issues of morality and global interdependence there were of course occasional mishaps rodgers liked to point to chee chee a 1928 musical from the novel the son of the grand eunuch which he referred to as his castration musical in the composer 's later years after hart and hammerstein had died his shows with a variety of collaborators were failures with the definite exception of no strings his only full scale attempt at writing both music and lyrics in retrospect one wishes he had continued in that pursuit that once again he had acted as his own hart or hammerstein the richard rodgers reader is like surfing the internet one can dip into it or read it section by section a great deal of it should be familiar to those who have read other books on the subject including rodgers 's autobiography musical stages but some of the inclusions are rediscoveries like the new yorker profile of rodgers and hart by margaret case harriman in which among other things she reminds us how their songs often evolved in 1934 they wrote the score for a metro goldwyn mayer movie starring jean harlow and one song prayer was jettisoned under a new title the bad in every man it momentarily was used in another mgm film manhattan melodrama third time around they took the music to a song publisher who suggested it needed a romantic title like the blue hour or the hour of parting the next day the song became blue moon one of those rare rodgers and hart tunes not associated with a musical it is interpolated into the score of babes in arms in the version of the show currently at the goodspeed opera house in east haddam conn in the book rodgers speaks about himself hart and hammerstein and hammerstein speaks about the other two hart is the almost silent partner rarely does the book deal with rodgers 's personal life and his depression leaving that to meryle secrest 's biography somewhere for me the one disappointment is the section most anticipated an excerpt from an oral history with the composer at columbia university an interview that is marred by banal questions fortunately that is followed by an interview from dramatists guild quarterly in which rodgers tries to explain his method music is my medium my language he says a painter 's medium is color in composition on canvas i use sound in american popular song alec wilder 's invaluable book analyzing the work of five great american popular composers george gershwin cole porter jerome kern irving berlin and rodgers the author says that rodgers 's songs have over the years revealed a higher degree of consistent excellence inventiveness and sophistication than any of the others there is no reason to doubt that estimation from manhattan his first hit to the sweetest sounds rodgers 's lilting melodies were to enter our consciousness and to move one to sing just by reading the titles of his songs
