michael chang walked off the grandstand court at the united states open yesterday then stopped in his tracks as the cheers grew into a roar shaking his fist as he did a full turn it was the sort of emotional gesture chang once reserved for victories over the game 's top players in the latter stages of grand slam tournaments instead of first round victories over aging spanish veterans ranked 83rd in the world but chang 's standards for what constitutes a meaningful victory have been slipping steadily in recent seasons along with his ranking and while there was a time when he was crestfallen not to reach the final here at flushing meadows yesterday he looked delighted just to reach the second round with a 7 6 6 3 6 6 4 7 6 3 victory over francisco clavet it has been a difficult road this year but still i look at every day as a new opportunity he said for those who grew to admire chang 's hustle and classy demeanor over the years it has been a painful period and the questions about when he might join jim courier in retirement have grown more insistent at his peak in 1996 chang was ranked no 2 when he took the court against clavet he was at no 133 the lowest since he was 15 and a tour rookie his record this season is 5 15 but chang is doing his best to block out the increasing evidence of his decline and search for a dignified exit strategy he 's hoping to end with a bang said chang 's older brother and longtime coach carl we 'll see at 30 chang acknowledges that he is in the twilight of his career and recently published an autobiography that summed up its peaks and valleys the timing of which was surely no coincidence but chang also acknowledges that he is stubborn and he is not prepared to give specifics about when the sun might drop below the horizon giving him plenty of time for missionary work and fishing trips off his mercer island home near seattle it really does n't cross my mind a whole lot he said of his ranking i think when you 've played at the level that i 've played anything outside the top 10 in certain aspects is just a number unless you 're obviously trying to get into tournaments and stuff obviously that 's going to be a factor for me the rest of the year a ranking of 133 is not good enough to get in the main draw of any significant tour event not even enough to get in many insignificant events but chang has already taken the hint and tried to rebuild his game and confidence in tennis 's minor leagues the challengers he has played six of them this year and it is a measure of his disarray that he has won just one in calabasas calif in april what worked for his generational measuring stick andre agassi who rebounded from 141 in the world to no 1 by dropping down to the challenger level in 1997 has not helped chang but true to himself the tinkering and hustling continues shortly before winning in calabasas he put an end to his several month experiment with a babolat racket and resumed using the long body prince with which he did most of his damage during his career it was a powerful stick but it was hard to control carl chang said of the babolat you have to have the right style for it and on big points he just did n't have confidence in the racket the switch has helped some he was 0 7 in 2002 before the change and there have been recent signs of life including a first round victory over a top 10 player tommy haas of germany in cincinnati this month but haas has had more on his mind than tennis after the motorcycle accident that left his father seriously injured in june but clavet was fully focused today if not terribly consistent at 33 he is the oldest man in the draw and he has already announced that this will be his last season he played as if he were aware of how meaningful this tournament was alternating winners and errors chang looked on edge too and at times he looked little like himself serving and volleying frequently down the stretch it 's been difficult to get away from what has worked for so long chang said i realize that i 'm in the twilight of my career you know i feel like if i do n't change something then the results maybe are going to continue the way that they have that for me is not something that i want to really be a part of for now he is still a part of the united states open but with retirement looming and roger federer seeded no 13 looming in the second round that might not be the case for much longer
