just hours after the cabinet resigned to make way for a smooth transfer of power japan 's governing party today nominated its secretary general yoshiro mori to replace the ailing prime minister keizo obuchi who was felled over the weekend by a stroke the nomination of mr mori who was second to mr obuchi in the party hierarchy is expected to be easily ratified later today by the parliament the selection reflected the fulfillment of a carefully choreographed script by the governing liberal democratic party to ensure a smooth and quick succession to mr obuchi who still lies in a coma once the choice of mr mori is made official the new prime minister a longtime party stalwart is widely expected to organize new elections quickly most likely before japan plays host to a summit meeting of the leading economic powers known as the group of eight in okinawa in july the announcement of mr mori 's selection by the liberal democrats represents the near culmination of an extraordinary transition in japanese politics in which news of mr obuchi 's hospitalization early on sunday was kept from the nation for 22 hours while party leaders consulted among themselves over what to do next from the moment the announcement of mr obuchi 's stroke was made late sunday evening the succession of events here has been almost blindingly fast for a country more used to political changes measured at a snail 's pace the mechanics of the succession however from the temporary passing of power to a caretaker prime minister mikio aoki to the selection of mr mori in backroom consultations among the party 's factions has left many japanese complaining that their political system is both antiquated and relatively undemocratic mr obuchi was japan 's first prime minister to suffer a catastrophically incapacitating illness before any transition arrangements could be made revealing a system badly unprepared for such an eventuality mr mori in a brief statement this morning praised mr obuchi 's record and promised to follow in his footsteps mr obuchi challenged many things including the reconstruction of the japanese economy mr mori said my mission is to make sure that we stay on the pay path of economic growth he is expected to continue mr obuchi 's policies including giving priority to economic growth even if that means increases in government debt in preparation for the party decision the cabinet resigned on tuesday evening mr mori is expected to reappoint the ministers and then turn to regular business including economic doldrums and scheduled diplomatic meetings mr mori 62 won support by demonstrating a strong loyalty to mr obuchi even more useful to him were his close ties to the main coalition partner the buddhist backed new komeito mr mori 's ratification by parliament is considered a foregone conclusion because the coalition led by the liberal democrats has a large majority mr mori is a lifelong party operative who as with mr obuchi before him gradually rose through the ranks he was elected to parliament in 1969 and was at various times education minister head of the party policy council trade and industry minister and construction minister he has twice been secretary general of the liberal democrats but the portfolios that typically define the true heavyweights finance minister and foreign minister eluded him those gaps in his resume and his reputation for timidity on policy issues have led many commentators to say they would expect little innovation under his leadership many commentators said that by choosing mr mori a burly raspy voiced politician not known for his personal popularity or campaigning skills the party was taking a huge risk in the national elections with tears streaking down his cheeks the caretaker prime minister mikio aoki said on tuesday that the government 's dissolution had been made based on the judgment of the doctors and from the viewpoint that we should not allow even one moment 's political vacuum the news was announced after persistent reports that mr obuchi 's condition was worsening and that the prime minister was brain dead mr aoki denied that saying he was very upset at news organizations for passing on rumors politicians close to the transition and several political experts said the governing party had used an extraordinary news blackout surrounding mr obuchi 's hospitalization and the carefully stage managed process since then to engineer the selection of mr mori as its unopposed candidate for the succession the party has a long history of running things it has governed the country alone or in coalitions for all but two and a half years since 1955 the secretive handling of the news and the backroom decision making drew renewed criticism from several quarters the choice of mr mori speaks volumes political experts said about unusual imperatives in japanese politics loyalty to partners and allies in a crunch rather than to the party 's immediate political needs and even potentially to its survival it is not that the ldp lacks people who could enjoy popularity said masumi ishikawa a professor of politics at niigata university of international and information studies there are mr kono and mr kato both of whom would probably be more popular foreign minister yohei kono and koichi kato a former secretary general of the party were generally believed to aspire to the prime minister 's post the ldp is basing its decision on who has a good relationship with komeito said mr ishikawa a former senior political correspondent of the daily asahi shimbun they are not thinking of the reaction of the people of japan and this behavior is very strange many experts described the liberal democrats choice of mr mori on the basis of the allied party 's comfort as a recipe for electoral difficulties because the two party coalition has been deeply unpopular since it was formed last october opinion polls have consistently shown that voters disapprove of having a party with religious affiliations in the government the government will also have to move to dissipate criticism of the secretive mechanics of a succession in which mr aoki was allowed to serve in place of the stricken prime minister in the interim merely on the basis of what he described as a private conversation with mr obuchi further contributing to the image of a process of party barons meeting in smoke filled rooms to keep the public in the dark was the way in which mr mori was selected insiders spoke with almost reverential approval of the consultations describing them as a confirmation of the efficiency of the political system mr aoki 's reaction to obuchi 's collapse was very tactful deputy speaker watanabe said if he had waited a week or 10 days after mr obuchi collapsed somebody else could have raised their hand as a candidate and there could be some chaos
