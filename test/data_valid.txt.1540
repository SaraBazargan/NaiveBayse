donald trump is known as the brash builder of manhattan high rises and atlantic city casinos not dogleg par 4 's in westchester but mr trump is building a golf course in briarcliff manor that will eventually include upscale apartments and town houses it is called what else trump national golf club and memberships start at 125000 preliminary work began last week on the 7200 yard par 72 layout designed by jim fazio a prominent golf course architect the course is scheduled for completion by the end of next year mr trump gained approvals earlier this month for the project on the 147 acre site of the briar hall golf and country club it will be his first project in westchester but something seems odd here in the film caddyshack rodney dangerfield who plays a boorish developer freeloading at a snobby country club declares country clubs and cemeteries are the biggest wastes of prime real estate and one of the hallmarks of mr trump 's career is his record of eking out every last bit of profit potential from craps tables to co ops from his properties but the residential component of mr trump 's briarcliff plan includes only 87 units two apartment buildings and 16 town houses far fewer than a previous developer proposed pressed for an explanation mr trump called westchester county the toughest place to build on the planet citing zoning restrictions and local resistance to development still he is seeking permits to build two other golf courses in westchester the seven springs club in bedford and french hill in yorktown heights and another in putnam valley called indian hills the community likes having space and open air and generally prefers golf courses to the prospect of building 250 houses on a site mr trump said referring to other developers failures to win approval for subdivisions on the briarcliff property and the bedford site mr trump said he would concentrate on building holes before homes for several reasons to capitalize on the spending power of wall streeters catching the golf bug his own love of the game and a need to indulge his creative side i like shaping land he said i get a real thrill from buying it and shaping it beautifully and artistically it 's a whole other thing from building a 90 story tower across from the un mr trump said that he bought the property for 8 million in a foreclosure about five years ago and is investing around 30 million to build the course keith austin the mayor of briarcliff manor said that mr trump hired an army of consultants to comply with town regulations it was important for us to keep this property a golf course mr austin said if we did n't there was always the possibility of it being sold for single family homes given his urban high rise aesthetic mr trump might be expected to produce a clubhouse wrapped in shiny gold glass but the donald has been forced to adopt an uncharacteristic buttoned down restraint for instance the town planning board required the clubhouse to be a white clapboard structure half the size of the one mr trump had in mind nor would the board indulge mr trump 's wish to hold professional golf tournaments at the course too much traffic it said but if local restrictions have reined in the builder 's glitz on the outside the club is pure trump indoors the kind of place where a high rolling golfer could take a supermodel girlfriend members could head from the 19th hole on a large veranda overlooking the course to a formal dining room mr trump hopes to have 350 playing members and another 100 social members initiation fees have increased along with demand said carolyn kepcher the general manager of the course prices started at less than 100000 they are now 125000 and may increase to 300000 before the club opens she said more than 100 people have already paid to join she said annual dues would be 9000 mr fazio the course architect said trump national will be a long course with several severe par 4 's up to 450 and 460 yards long it will play very hard from the back tees he said and require long drives to reach the fairways on many holes the course will have a hilly front nine and a flatter back nine with streams and ponds throughout and a deep ravine meandering through six of the holes being built over the old briar hill layout some of the new holes would use the same imprint he said but the holes will not run in any similar order and will occasionally even run in the reverse direction mr fazio said the course would compare with westchester 's top courses winged foot which has been the host to several united states open championships and the westchester country club home of the buick open i 've played those courses he said and when you compare them hole for hole it 's going to be hard to decide which course is better mr fazio designed mr trump 's golf course in palm beach trump national he said may turn out even better because the terrain including 7000 trees offers natural challenges it will have no gimmicks or tricks he said it 's built to challenge the pros but i always give the weekend player a place to bail out mr fazio said his partnership with mr trump results in top level golf courses because he does n't give me a budget i get a blank check but ron whitten the architecture editor for golf digest said that it takes more than money to build a great golf course fazio is a talented architect and if he gets a big budget he 'll probably build a good course mr whitten said will it be the equivalent of winged foot hell no winged foot has 75 years worth of us opens and pga 's on them mr trump said he plays golf once a week and is a 5 handicap at winged foot his home course mr whitten said that he sneaked into mr trump 's locker at winged foot one day and as a joke swiped his handicap certification sticker it showed a handicap of 6 if he 's a legitimate 6 at winged foot mr whitten said he 's probably spending too much time playing golf
