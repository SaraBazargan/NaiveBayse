in a sign of its distaste for mayor michael r bloomberg 's budget the new york city council is considering the rare step of passing its own budget though details have not been determined the mere suggestion of adopting a budget without mayoral consent indicates how seriously the council views the city 's fiscal crisis a new york city council has exerted its power to reject the mayor 's budget only once in 1998 when mayor rudolph w giuliani proposed using tax money to build a new stadium for the yankees on the west side of manhattan the council balked and approved its own 34 billion budget if we 're not able to come to an agreement with the administration on a budget that we think is in the best interest of the people of the city of new york we would pass our own budget gifford miller the council speaker said yesterday that 's our responsibility we can not nor would we ever give up that responsibility mr miller said the bloomberg plan with its thousands of layoffs service cuts and closings of clinics and firehouses had forced the council to consider many other options i ca n't rule anything out because what 's on the table is also an extraordinarily devastating potential set of cuts he said but whether mr miller could unite his colleagues behind such an effort is unclear he might not have the broad consensus achieved in 1998 when the council rejected the mayoral budget because he and five other members of the council will be lame ducks if a court ruling supporting the city 's term limits law is upheld mr miller is appealing that term limits decision then there is the larger question of whether the council wants to pick a fight with the mayor when it views albany as its real enemy it 's not the solution to the albany problem said one high ranking city council staff member right now any sign of disunity between the council and the mayor would be an invitation to albany to give us nothing councilwoman christine c quinn of manhattan said a council budget is certainly a worst case scenario that has to be considered but it 's not something you want to have to use because the administration would still have to implement the council 's budget and if there is n't the will on the part of the administration to implement that budget then it just wreaks another kind of havoc mr bloomberg said yesterday that he doubted that a budget drawn up by the council would make people any happier each individual council person very understandably would like to say 'not in my backyard i do n't want my constituents programs cut the mayor said but when you try to put a budget together you have to get agreements from somebody else to say 'well ok we wo n't cut yours i 'll take more of a cut that 's a very difficult thing to do in recent weeks the council has suggested many ways to plug the 38 billion deficit the city faces in the fiscal year that begins in july and yesterday mr miller and other council members crisscrossed the city to criticize the mayor 's budget and remind constituents of its savings ideas mr miller spent yesterday morning on two radio shows discussing the city 's financial problems for every cut mr bloomberg has even hinted at mr miller and council members have rolled out a platter of alternatives one of the council 's most comprehensive ideas is a slightly different version of mr bloomberg 's commuter tax while the mayor wants to tax commuters up to 27 percent mr miller and the council favor a version that would tax commuters 11 percent of income and promise a return of 11 percent to suburban cities that employ new york city residents we are in this together as a region mr miller said what is good for new york city is critically important for the prosperity and health of nassau and suffolk and westchester and rockland and orange property values in those areas are tied to the success of new york city but some city council members question whether mr bloomberg views officials in the east wing of city hall as allies at all councilman charles barron of brooklyn was the subject of a verbal attack that included a rare expletive on tuesday when he questioned mr bloomberg about his budget plan during a briefing session according to several council members some say that the outburst illustrates the short shrift the mayor has given to proposals other than his own including a private effort seeking corporate donations to keep all city firehouses open the mayor is raising tens of millions of dollars for the republican convention which is appropriate said councilman bill de blasio of brooklyn it 's equally appropriate to allow the corporate community to show its appreciation to the fire department it 's simply money we would n't otherwise have mr bloomberg has said that city law prohibits the earmarking of private donations to public agencies such donations must become part of the general fund but mr de blasio argues that the law could easily be changed given the city 's problems if we need a new law to authorize that type of earmarking then we should do it he said we should be moving heaven and earth to encourage generosity the council is trying to help find solutions here i hope that is understood on the other side of the hall
