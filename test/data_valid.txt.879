this should be a great decade for small capitalization stocks says charles m royce the lead manager of the 800 million pennsylvania mutual fund we 're beginning another bullish cycle that started six months ago after the october lows mr royce said from his manhattan office although there 's short term risk over the next three or four months we think the outlook for small stocks is excellent smaller capitalization stocks tend to perform relatively well when the overall market is generating low returns an environment that he expects to persist for some time he expects smaller stocks to return 15 to 20 percent annualized from last october when they hit what he believes was a bottom through the rest of the decade the fund returned 115 percent annualized for the three years through thursday placing among the top 12 percent of all small blend funds which own a mix of small capitalization growth and value stocks that category returned 37 percent annualized during that time while the standard poor 's 500 stock index fell 11 percent according to morningstar inc the fund lost 12 percent in the 12 months through thursday versus losses of 5 percent for its group and 4 percent for the index mr royce 63 is president and chief investment officer of royce associates the fund 's investment adviser which manages about 8 billion in mutual funds and private accounts w whitney george 45 managing director and vice president of the adviser was named co manager in 2001 in 1972 mr royce took over the fund from pikard company which is defunct at the time the fund had 4 million in assets pikard 's owner kept a country home in pennsylvania hence the fund name thinking back to his beginnings as a money manager near the start of the 1973 74 bear market mr royce said i think of risk as important as reward and that 's hardwired into everything we do the managers pick the roughly 200 stocks in the fund from companies with market capitalizations of less than 2 billion about half the companies are microcaps with market caps of less than 400 million mr royce typically avoids initial public offerings because he generally regards them as too risky although some companies in the portfolio are tiny he said they are often big players in their industries and may be 25 or 30 years old his first focus is on financial strength because the whole universe of smaller stocks is so fragile a strong balance sheet is an excellent differentiator of business models he said the portfolio companies typically have little or no debt a characteristic that tends to go hand in hand with high returns on assets and invested capital he said debt is more troublesome in smaller companies he added because they have less access to the capital markets the managers aim to establish the worth of each company and to buy shares at a discount in the hope of doubling their money over the next three to five years another consideration is a company 's management whether it 's first or second generation or a company in transition mode mr royce said management creates the company 's culture and its overall business plan some companies in the portfolio are eventually acquired by bigger ones and at a premium he estimates that takeovers account for about 15 to 20 percent of the fund 's long term performance in april the fund paid 22 canadian dollars on average for shares of the tsx group which operates the toronto stock exchange the shares trade at 2685 canadian dollars or 1979 the managers say they are worth 35 canadian dollars a share the toronto exchange will soon start trading stocks in both american and canadian dollars mr royce said reducing the need for big canadian companies which typically hold dual listings to trade on the new york stock exchange he said tsx has significant cash and a dividend yield of 3 percent a weakening american dollar he said may create additional profit for investors in the united states the managers have been adding shares of the woodward governor company which is based in rockford ill and produces components for commercial aircraft and industrial equipment engines the fund has owned the stock since august 1994 and has paid 2864 a share on average it now trades at 3939 the managers say they believe shares are worth 50 the stock is very cyclical mr george said and traded at more than 80 in mid 2001 they 're taking market share from their competitors and we think that they 'll come out of this a bigger better business he said another holding is simpson manufacturing a company in dublin calif that produces wood to wood wood to concrete and wood to masonry connectors used in building construction its niche products and strong cost control have helped it achieve profit margins averaging 16 to 18 percent mr royce said the company has no debt but more than 120 million in cash it is generating cash faster than management can reinvest in the business he said mr royce started the position in august 1994 and added shares recently the fund 's average cost has been 644 the stock is now at 3702 the fund managers say they think the shares are worth 55
