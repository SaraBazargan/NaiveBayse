he is in perhaps the hottest series on television which pays him more than he ever earned onstage and recently landed him an emmy nomination for best actor in a drama series so you can not help wondering why michael c hall decided to spend his summer hiatus performing eight shows a week on broadway instead of relaxing at the beach but then you see him strutting the stage of the shubert theater in a tuxedo and white carnation as women swoon around him while he croons all i care about is love and suddenly it makes sense is n't it every actor 's dream to play a heartthrob in a hit broadway show mr hall may have become a familiar face because of hbo 's six feet under he resumes shooting the series third season next month but he felt it was worth stepping in for a brief stint as billy flynn the smooth talking criminal lawyer in the long running kander and ebb hit chicago something else sweetened the deal his wife amy spanger is playing opposite him as the winning but homicidal roxie hart they have both signed on for only six weeks mr hall 31 leaves the show after sept 10 to start shooting six feet under in los angeles ms spanger will accompany him there in an interview the other day at a restaurant on columbus avenue mr hall described the part of billy flynn as a great departure for me particularly in contrast to his television role as david fisher a gay member of a family that runs a funeral parlor after having played this tightly wound conflicted character to play someone so at ease in control without conflict is a welcome break he said he is also enjoying the physical experience of belting his songs to the back of the house rather than performing in the more contained world of the small screen appearing on a stage is not a departure for mr hall he is not a hollywood actor looking for legitimacy on broadway he needs the stage in a different way because it is where he came from and he does not like being away from it for long before 'six feet under i had never gone more than a month or two without doing theater he said now it 's been more than a year and a half he has joined the growing ranks of television stars who have been gravitating to the stage including several other hbo actors just last season sarah jessica parker of sex and the city appeared in a manhattan theater club production of wonder of the world her sex and the city co star cynthia nixon had roles in the the women on broadway and in free to be you and me off broadway and edie falco of sopranos fame is currently starring in frankie and johnny in the clair de lune mr hall 's stage resume includes roles in henry v timon of athens macbeth and cymbeline all at the joseph papp public theater terrence mcnally 's controversial corpus christi in 1998 at the manhattan theater club and regional theater at the mark taper forum in los angeles and at the williamstown theater festival in massachusetts he is also comfortable in singing roles having played the mc in the current revival of cabaret on broadway directed by sam mendes a kander and ebb musical with a dark sensibility similar to that of chicago mr hall met mr mendes while performing in the 1999 workshop production of stephen sondheim 's wise guys which mr mendes also directed the mc as recreated by mr mendes and alan cumming who originated the role in the revival wears corsets and heavy makeup and has direct contact with members of the audience mr hall said it was a decisive role for him you can get away with acting onstage and at times imagining your relationship with the audience is adversarial they 're potentially critical and you might shut them out he said with the mc i had no choice but to step out onstage and operate from a place of love for the audience my motto he added was 'never hide the singing in mr hall 's life came before the acting brought up in raleigh nc he was a member of his church choir and school chorus and appeared in his high school 's musicals usually playing the character roles like the hired hand jud fry in oklahoma and lazar wolf the butcher in fiddler on the roof his mother is a school guidance counselor his father who worked for ibm died of cancer when mr hall was 11 it was a tough time to lose him because i think our relationship was on the cusp of becoming richer mr hall said adding that not a day goes by that he does not think of his father it was at earlham college in indiana that mr hall took his first acting class and began to think of theater as a career until then he had assumed he would become a lawyer he earned a master 's degree in fine arts at new york university and immediately began getting work though he has collected his share of unemployment checks along the way inevitably seeing mr hall being intimate with another man on television as he is in six feet under was an adjustment for some of his friends and relatives the actor said but mr hall said he was mainly focused on the larger burden bestowed on him by the show 's creator alan ball presenting something groundbreaking for television i was n't so nervous about kissing a guy i was nervous about getting it right he said there was a sense of responsibility there and a sense of excitement mr hall met ms spanger nearly six years ago and they were married in may they live on the upper west side of manhattan and have temporary digs in los angeles barry weissler and his wife fran weissler who produced chicago thought it would be fun for the newlyweds to be onstage together and it looks as if it is especially when she is flopping around on his lap as the puppet to his ventriloquist during we both reached for the gun it seemed like a no brainer to bring them both in as a team mr weissler said adding that the box office had shown a decided jump since mr hall went into the show ms spanger had played roxie before in the musical 's first national tour she also stood by for roxie and the other leading female role velma kelly in the broadway production which was directed by walter bobbie and opened in 1996 it can be tough for a married couple to be in the same field show business unions have a particularly bad record a reality that mr hall said he is well aware of it 's like anything else it requires attention he said but i am much better for the support amy gives me she 's a real advocate and i 'd like to be the same for her chicago shubert theater 225 west 44th street
