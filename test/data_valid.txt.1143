i did a very unneighborly thing recently i put up a fence it runs the length of our backyard and is six feet high i had no great reason for putting up the fence except that i think it 's prettier than the black chicken wire and green stakes that used to separate our yard from the neighbors yard the same week i put up the fence of course i did n't actually put up the fence i live in a town where it is understood that when people say they did something they mean they hired someone to do the thing our next door neighbor not the backyard fence neighbor removed the walkway leading from her front door to the sidewalk now instead of the long inviting path through the center of her yard a short stubby path leads from her front door to her driveway she and the man who actually did the work said that sidewalks that cut across the front yard were no longer in style they chop up the front yard and no one uses them anyway they said i love walkways that lead from the street to the front door they seem so welcoming the short stumpy thing that goes from the door to the driveway great for hauling groceries and children from your car to your house is no good for anyone but you really but who am i to talk the owner of a 100 foot long fence that is six feet high from my backyard if you bend over and tilt your head sideways you can see the neighbors in their backyard otherwise we 've shut them out and ourselves in is that what we 're supposed to be doing in this new century looking further inward there are two lines from robert frost 's poem mending wall that come to mind when i look at my fence which is all the time because it dominates the backyard where my children play the first line of the poem is something there is that does n't love a wall what is the something i wonder looking at its hulking mass across my yard frost blames hunters elves and nature for knocking down his wall in time the boards in my fence will rot and random tree roots will up and knock it over why bother when it 's going to come down anyway it 's not as if we have to keep our cows from mingling with the neighbors the neighbor mending the wall with frost says good fences make good neighbors really my backyard neighbor and i used to chat sometimes over the chicken wire and scrubby bushes between us nothing deep but we stayed in touch now unless i bend and tilt my head i never see her but that 's something of a relief it was weird when they had a cookout and did n't invite us or vice versa now we can have all the cookouts we want and not invite them and not feel bad about it frost might say that we are all pine and they are apple orchard what is it that we want from suburbia to be anonymous to have cookouts and invite our apartment dwelling city friends who do n't even know what their neighbors look like to exclaim over our green grass our trees our flower gardens anthony the 9 year old who lives in the yard over the fence is the same age as my daughter he used to climb the tree that lies in the path of the fence dangle from one of its limbs and then drop when things in our yard looked interesting sometimes he 'd just climb the tree sit on a branch and watch waiting to see if the action on our side of the chicken wire was worth a visit to our yard i 've seen anthony only once since the fence went up it was a day i had climbed his tree and was trimming branches from it with a saw he joined me in the tree and asked if i was going to be taking it down too i told him no and then he begged me not to saw off a branch i had my eye on he needed the branch he said so that he could still climb the tree i saved the branch but anthony does n't come he can still hear us but unless he 's figured out the body bending head tilt he ca n't see us i miss him in the tree or suddenly in the backyard appearing from the air like a superhero just when a team is short a player and mom is about to be asked to join in maybe the tree and fence together are too many obstacles maybe the fence makes him feel unwelcome i wonder if he knows about my front sidewalk it starts at the door and leads out into the street come anthony come everyone even jehovah 's witnesses it beckons out of style and crumbling he can take it right up to the front door ring the bell and come in or not ring the bell and simply walk inside i should have taken frost 's advice and asked myself what i was walling in or out before i put up the fence now partly walled in i think i ought to widen my front path and plant flowers on both sides maybe anthony will come help soapbox jennifer judd lives in glen ridge
