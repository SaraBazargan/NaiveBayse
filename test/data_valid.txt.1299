q in a play you wrote a few years ago a character refers to ae housman 's claim that love is either virgilian and conquers all or ovidian and is something we conquer would you say you 're more virgil the romantic or ovid the classicist i think it 's more a case of which one is showing which one is outside and which one is inside i think i give the impression of being a romantic and i think inside i 'm quite severe but some might say they had the opposite impression of me it 's all part of the fun is n't it could there be more than two kinds of love how many are there well that 's sort of an unanswerable question you know one can evade these questions by giving smart answers like as many kinds as there are different kinds of people which may be the case is love something we 've created or does it exist of itself oh dear i once did a radio program with a famous materialist that is to say a scientist who believed that absolutely everything was physical and that all emotions were reductive to little electrical impulses in your neurons and i found that i did n't believe that but what the emotions really are i do n't have an alternative theory housman never says i love you in the invention of love is there a better way to say i love you than that no simplicity is good subject verb object what 's the wittiest cleverest way you 've said i love you first of all i have no idea and secondly i have a personality defect that precludes me from answering questions about my own intimate life if i 've ever had one and so forth i just do n't feel comfortable with that ok why do many of us fall in love so easily with characters onstage and film i think one is attracted to people one sees in films and plays yes but you 'd be an idiot to think that you had enough information to go on to actually fall in love with them yes although i 'm rather sympathetic toward people who simply can not make the distinction between the actor and the character if i see an actor in a role that is really terrifying no matter how many times i meet him socially i 'm still frightened of him i think he 's going to hit me but i did actually write a 15 minute radio play about 40 years ago about a husband who falls in love who 's in love with marilyn monroe i found that very understandable is writing plays the writing you love most it is yes but that 's partly because i love the collaborative element we should be envied by novelists who essentially mail it in and go and do something else part of the pleasure and the excitement is the translation of the text into event and that beats the ideas it 's more about the event you know you 're talking about a play that is a romantic play and a lot of your questions have been about love and quite right too but one of the great pleasures of working in the theater is that behind the poetry or the metaphysics or the mystery of human relationships and dozens of other things that might be in a play i love the way that it ends up being an obsession with the level of certain lights the timing of certain sound effects the pace of somebody 's entrance speaking of real world activity is working in the theater more conducive to falling in love than say getting up and going to an office are you talking about the actors falling in and out love with one another does n't that happen at merrill lynch well i guess i hope so i imagine it does however when you do a play you end up being part of a relatively small group of people who are on a kind of raft in the ocean and they 're the only people on it and nobody else understands so there is a tendency for a lot of bonding some of which might become romantic are you in love now oh i do n't answer questions like that sorry amy barrett
