the yankees traded drew henson once threatening his lifelong dream of playing in pinstripes and henson would not let the chance get away again henson has agreed to a six year 17 million contract with the yankees and will forgo his senior year as the university of michigan quarterback and a chance at winning the heisman trophy late friday night henson a 21 year old third baseman accepted the yankees offer which includes a stipulation that he will not play football during the tenure of the contract he announced the agreement this morning during the past year i have come to the realization that my passion is baseball henson said in a statement released by the yankees for as long as i can remember i have spent spring and summer evenings playing baseball and i can think of no better way to earn a living than doing what i love most to me there would be no greater goal than to help the new york yankees win another world series henson is to receive a 1 million signing bonus in a deal negotiated by his agent casey close from 2001 to 2006 his annual salaries will be 1 million 1 million 2 million 22 million 38 million and 6 million henson was in a unique bargaining position and therefore his deal is the only one of its kind a huge financial commitment for a player with only 600 minor league at bats the yankees on the other hand knew that they would have to compete with the potential signing bonus henson might receive if he was selected high in the national football league draft in the spring of 2002 but if henson turns out to be as good as the yankees think he has been compared to the phillies hall of famer mike schmidt he could be an incredible bargain by the end of his deal henson will probably spend this summer playing in the minor leagues and if he plays in the majors sometime next year his contract could encompass as many as three seasons of arbitration eligibility by comparison shortstop derek jeter made 10 million in his fifth season in 2000 henson 's salary in his sixth season would be 6 million little more than half of jeter 's henson had a strong bargaining position but the yankees probably strengthened their own last summer when they swapped him to cincinnati in a deal for pitcher denny neagle after henson refused a direct overture from the owner george steinbrenner to quit football this seemed to have helped henson understand how much he wanted to play for the yankees and when they traded for him on march 21 he seized his latest opportunity to play for them i can not risk turning it down again henson said in his statement brian cashman the yankees general manager said i 'm extremely excited about having him in our organization yankees manager joe torre said he 's a future superstar no question a generation of players who have won championships for the yankees is moving on david cone jeff nelson and joe girardi are already gone and tino martinez paul o'neill and scott brosius may be playing in their last season with the team but within two years the yankees can project an infield of henson at third jeter at shortstop alfonso soriano at second and the top prospect nick johnson at first base it 's pretty impressive when you consider what we 've done in the last five years with veteran players torre said hopefully the transition will be ready made it 's very unusual to be able to fill in at the two corners with the young players we have with their talent
