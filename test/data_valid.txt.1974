a web site devoted to gossip about the food service industry has partly shut down after being threatened with legal action by us foodservice the united states subsidiary of the dutch supermarket retailer royal ahold which is under investigation by federal authorities for accounting irregularities the web site foodservicerumors com started five years ago as a virtual water cooler where people employed by food service distributors and their customers congregated online to trade gossip steve hoschler a fifth grade teacher in sacramento who operates the web site received a letter by fax from us foodservice 's lawyer robert s brennen who asked that defamatory and confidential postings be removed mr hoschler a former food service executive said in an interview that us foodservice had not made clear which e mail messages it wanted removed so he had no choice but to close the main news page he said he believed that the web site which is not profitable was a forum for free speech but was worried that on a salary of 34000 a year he does not have the money to defend himself against a corporation us foodservice 's objections center on postings that it considers defamatory and that also disclose confidential information since the accounting scandals erupted at royal ahold including the company 's disclosure that it overstated profits by 500 million in the last two years foodservicerumorscom has posted several internal company memos including one that asked employees to save documents in relation to subpoenas issued by the united states attorney 's office royal ahold is under investigation by the united states attorney 's office in manhattan and by the securities and exchange commission neither us foodservice nor its lawyer would comment on the postings in question but in his letter mr brennen noted through your web site you are engaged in an effort to improperly interfere with usf 's relationships with its employees by causing them to breach their duties to the company the incident puts the web site in a position that is becoming common in the internet age while the courts have increasingly exonerated web sites and internet service providers for posting material by third parties those rulings hold small comfort for individuals who can not afford to take their case to trial while many major publishing companies have teams of legal advisers the operators of web sites are often individuals without such resources oftentimes the intent of a libel suit is not to win at trial but to stop a person from talking said russell smith of the law firm of smith dornan shea the mere fact of having to prove your case and all the legal fees that incurs can inhibit freedom of speech when cases do go to trial web site publishers increasingly take refuge in a clause in the communications decency act of 1996 which states that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider in other words according to cindy cohn legal director of the electronic frontier foundation a nonprofit group that protects digital rights if you are just the host to other people 's speech then you are generally exempt from liability several cases have backed up that interpretation ms cohn said including a ruling by the california superior court in 2000 that cleared ebay of selling bootlegged copies of a musician 's recordings online increasingly the majority view is that operating a message board or web site where people post comments is like operating a telephone company said mr smith of smith dornan shea the phone company is obviously not liable for what people say over the phone lines the one distinction said victor a kovner of davis wright tremaine is when material is posted not by a third party but directly by the web site operator for instance mr kovner said when the amway corporation sued procter gamble in 1998 for operating a rogue web site that printed defamatory accusations about amway and its employees a united states district court in michigan absolved procter gamble but not the web site operator sidney schwartz who posted much of the material himself mr kovner said it would be for a court to determine whether the food service postings were truly confidential or merely embarrassing for us foodservice as for the defamatory comments mr kovner said they may be mean and nasty but if they reflect opinion as i suspect they do on a 'rumors web site then they are not actionable
