to the editor re bush names cheney citing 'integrity and 'experience front page july 26 i am a moderate republican who was hoping that george w bush 's selection of a running mate would send a message that he intended to fight vigorously for the middle ground unfortunately i feel that his choice of dick cheney may be ceding the middle ground to the democrats how can the republicans expect to win when they cede the middle ground to the opposition without a fight james h bernstein new york july 26 2000
