steve trachsel grimaced and quickly shook his head as he walked off the mound for the last time tonight he had gotten too fine with his pitches and he was angry with himself that someone else had to dig him out of trouble graeme lloyd did just that as trachsel continued to berate himself lloyd struck out jimmy rollins with the bases loaded in the seventh inning and the mets went on to defeat the philadelphia phillies 5 0 trachsel 4 2 left veterans stadium with his fourth straight victory and a band aid on his right index finger trachsel had blisters on his finger and his thumb and no one knew how long he would last as he left the bullpen before the game he knew he would be fine this is the one we were worried about trachsel said looking down at his index finger and it did awesome trachsel who opened the season with a loss six no decisions and another loss gave up five hits tonight in six and two thirds innings he struck out five all in the fourth and fifth innings and walked three while throwing 110 pitches pretty much everything was working trachsel said trachsel said it helped enormously that the mets 24 29 scored two first inning runs off philadelphia starter kevin millwood 7 2 who was looking to become the first phillies pitcher since steve carlton in 1980 to win eight games before the end of may the mets had a season high six doubles roger cedeno belted a pitch for a double into the right field corner and rey sanchez hitting 208 drove home cedeno by looping an opposite field double after fouling off a bunt attempt sanchez was tagged out when he tried to go to third on ty wigginton 's ground ball to rollins and cliff floyd flied out but jeromy burnitz belted a towering double that hit the center field fence on a bounce and wigginton scored to make it 2 0 when you can get him a run or two early it really allows him to settle in and pick his spots mets catcher vance wilson said of trachsel over the last two years he 's pitched pretty well but i definitely think that his stuff is as good now as it 's been lloyd the 6 foot 7 left hander got the one strike that trachsel needed to make it a successful night after trachsel walked the last two batters he would face ricky ledee and tomas perez mets manager art howe called in lloyd to face rollins i gave him my recommendation on how to pitch to perez and he did n't follow it howe said with a smile lloyd threw rollins a cut fastball with two strikes and rollins tried to check his swing the plate umpire jerry layne did not call a strike but wilson appealed to the first base umpire dana demuth who much to the displeasure of the sparse crowd called rollins out it lifted me up and i hope it lifted the rest of the team up to get out of that situation lloyd said the mets were overjoyed after the mets scored two runs in the eighth on a booming double by floyd the phillies 28 25 managed only one base runner the rest of the game armando benitez struck out the side in the ninth it was like we scored when they got out of the inning without any runs howe said of lloyd 's strikeout floyd had scored the mets third run in the sixth when first baseman tony clark who is still hitting only 198 laced a 94 mile an hour millwood fastball down the right field line floyd walloped a double into left field with one out we 've just got to keep playing this way getting guys over getting guys in clark said it helps when someone like floyd continues to hit the ball hard floyd has driven in 9 runs and scored 10 runs in his last 11 games he has propped up his batting average to 251 because he is winning a battle against himself to be patient at the plate sometimes it 's rough because i want to do things so bad to help us out floyd said the mets could make that their slogan tonight 's victory ended a streak in which the mets lost three of four games but the optimists on the mets point out that they have won seven of their last 11 games with an interesting three game home series against atlanta looming floyd said the team was pointing for a 500 mark now that may seem like a modest goal for a team that had big aspirations but at least they are looking up i feel like everything 's going to fall into place as it should floyd said inside pitch mets officials would not comment on reports that first baseman mo vaughn who is on the 60 day disabled list with an inflamed left knee would probably not be able to return this season even if he does undergo surgery manager art howe said he was still waiting to hear from vaughn who is expected to make a decision friday on what medical procedure he will take relief pitcher john franco has completed his rehabilitation assignment and will probably be activated friday franco 42 has not pitched since the 2001 season he underwent reconstructive surgery on his left elbow last may 15 franco did not allow a run in his last two appearances both in relief for class aaa norfolk
