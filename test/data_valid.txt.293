brett favre stood in a players lounge in the bowels of lambeau field recently speaking passionately not about his green bay packers being in the playoffs or his place in nfl history but about how he was having fun again the good old favre from mississippi is back to having a good old time it 's been a few years since i 've had this much fun playing football he said in a recent interview i think that 's because this is the healthiest i 've been i 'm not fighting ankle injuries or hand injuries or god knows what else i 've had to fight through in the past couple of years he added no one on this team wants to win as much as i do but i 'm also the kind of person who enjoys playing i 'm not going to be one of these guys who talk about how the old days in football were better that 's not me i love the game and i hope people realize how hard i play it and how much respect i have for it fun for favre is leading his packers who will play the giants on sunday afternoon to an 11 4 record fun for him are those laser throws he can still make look easy people ask me when is my arm going to tire out and i tell them my arm strength will be there long after my legs and body are gone he said fun for favre is playing practical jokes this season he took some teammates to his steakhouse in green bay and privately asked the chef to add obscene amounts of spice to one lineman 's meal a good time for favre is winning in the cold where he is 30 0 at home when the temperature is 34 degrees or below it is being tough he is one of only four quarterbacks this season to take every meaningful snap for his team joining jake plummer in arizona jeff garcia in san francisco and kerry collins with the giants fun is being in the running for yet another most valuable player award which would be his fourth a record it is receiving the most votes for the pro bowl this season 670401 and fun is definitely what favre had sunday in a victory over minnesota after handing off to receiver donald driver on a reverse favre trucked downfield looking for someone to block he found a target in safety orlando thomas wiped him out and allowed driver to score yes favre is having a good time again and that means trouble for the rest of the sport favre is a lock for the hall of fame but a look at his statistics shows that he is creeping into the company of quarterbacks who are considered the top five in the history of pro football even the top three or two this is favre 's sixth 30 touchdown season an nfl record dan marino had four and no other player has three favre is the first thrower to pass for more than 3000 yards in 10 straight seasons since the afl nfl merger in 1970 favre has the second best home winning percentage of any nfl quarterback 66 12 terry bradshaw was 67 12 favre has 38312 passing yards 6 yards behind vinny testaverde who is eighth on the career list john unitas is seventh with 40239 and marino is first with 61361 favre passed joe montana last month and is in sixth place with 285 career passing touchdowns next year he will pass unitas who is fifth at 290 marino is tops with 420 favre has 3296 completions and needs one more to pass dan fouts for sixth on the career list marino is first with 4967 while he may not catch marino in statistics favre has one championship ring in two super bowl appearances while marino reached the super bowl once in his rookie season with miami it is interesting to note that by the middle of next season favre who will be 33 next october may pass montana and unitas whom many in the league consider the two best quarterbacks in touchdown passes completions and yards if favre plays another five to eight seasons which is very likely considering his arm is as strong as ever he may end up owning almost every significant passing record statistics do not always tell the complete picture the hall of famer otto graham is considered by some to be the best quarterback in pro history because he guided the cleveland browns to a division or league title in each of the 10 seasons he played but because of the era he starred in five decades ago his statistics are subpar with favre the statistics do n't lie they do tell how good he is but there is more favre may have the strongest arm of anyone who has played the game and the most guts as the block on thomas shows and that was n't the first such block he has thrown he is also one of the great winners in the sport 's history there is a duality to favre 's game that is both awesome and dangerous in green bay 's 13 point comeback victory against jacksonville last month favre had three touchdown passes and ran for the game winner with 90 seconds left that 's the thrilling favre but there is the favre who against atlanta this season forced a deep pass late that was intercepted with green bay trailing by 3 points when a safer throw would have allowed the drive to continue for a possible tying field goal attempt that 's the over the top favre i want to win favre said and sometimes being safe is not what i 'm about no being great is what favre is all about
