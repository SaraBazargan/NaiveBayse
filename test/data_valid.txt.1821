did onel de guzman create the love bug the most destructive computer virus in history i admit i create viruses but i do n't know if it 's one of mine he said in an interview here if the source code was given to me i could look at it and see maybe it is somebody else 's or maybe it was stolen from me mr de guzman 24 understands that in the information age fame is fleeting with his notoriety vanishing like so many 1 's and o 's in cyberspace this filipino computer school dropout wants the world to know he is a brilliant hacker a mastermind who can turn a pc into putty but mr de guzman has a problem his claim to fame is the suspicion that he created a computer bug that hopscotched around the world causing an estimated 10 billion in damage as it paralyzed computers from the pentagon to the british parliament in many countries that would have landed him in prison the philippine authorities filed theft and other charges against mr de guzman but dropped them in august because of insufficient evidence the case against him was weakened because at the time the philippines did not have laws governing computer espionage now it does which means that if mr de guzman confesses he could wind up back in legal trouble so this shy spiky haired young man is playing a risky game of wink and nod giving occasional interviews in which he refuses to own up to the virus but tries to cash in on the dark glory it confers there are so many computer geniuses out there said mr de guzman as his lawyer monitored his remarks but i think i have become part of the history of the philippines that can not be erased mr de guzman said he no longer hacked but he still practices cracking which he describes as gaining unauthorized access to passwords serial numbers and other numeric codes he said he used the technique to download unlicensed software from the internet rather than paying for it cracking does not destroy he said you know what effect you are going to have when you crack mr de guzman said he saw nothing wrong with purloining software just as he has no moral qualms about the damage caused by viruses he said software makers notably microsoft were to blame for the love bug debacle because they licensed products vulnerable to sabotage for programmers like us it is not wrong mr de guzman said speaking in tagalog i 'm the user i buy the product if i use it in a wrong or improper way why should i be blamed i bought the product people who follow the computer industry said such amoral attitudes were typical among computer hackers whether they lived in the teeming neighborhoods of manila or the low rise sprawl of silicon valley indeed until last spring mr de guzman was an unremarkable young man struggling to complete the requirements for a computer science degree at a technical college here on may 4 an e mail bearing the title i love you began popping up in computers in asia when opened it destroyed graphics and other files the e mail program commonly called a virus or worm spread by sending itself to all the other e mail addresses in a computer 's database within hours it had followed the rising sun to newsrooms brokerage firms and government offices in europe and the united states i was at home sleeping mr de guzman recalled when i woke up i heard it on the news it did n't mean anything to me manila quickly became the focus of a feverish worldwide hunt for the author of the virus the police identified mr de guzman as their prime suspect after a local internet service provider traced an unusually heavy volume of data traffic to a computer in the home of his sister mr de guzman at first said he might have released the virus by accident now he says he does not know how it got out mr de guzman said he became a suspect because of a thesis proposal he had submitted to his college the proposal which laid out a method for stealing passwords to gain free access to the internet was rejected mr de guzman said his professors were close minded they did not want to believe that i had created a program that exposed a hole in the operating system he said they could n't accept that i was able to do that i told them but they did n't want to accept it did he unleash the virus to vindicate his thesis i do n't know if i was the one proving it he said after a lengthy pause i just showed them the thesis mr de guzman holed up at his mother 's house for weeks after the police named him as a suspect the few times he ventured out he said he was pointed at by people he has since cut his hair and gained weight he says from eating home cooking and passing the time on a couch with a sony playstation these days mr de guzman said he could go out with his friends in relative anonymity but his return to obscurity has dampened his job prospects at the height of the affair mr de guzman said he was bombarded by job offers from computer companies he ignored them to focus on his legal defense now the companies have stopped calling mr de guzman wants people to know he is in the job market he said he would even consider microsoft whose outlook software was one of the main transmission vehicles for the virus if the offer is good if they 're not pressuring me i think maybe i might accept mr de guzman said first though he has to stay out of trouble mr de guzman 's lawyer rolando quimbo said that the internet service provider that was used to launch the virus had petitioned to reinstate the case against him while that seems unlikely mr quimbo wants his client to avoid incriminating statements in june prodded by the love bug case the philippine government passed a law that bans hacking by then however it was too late to prosecute mr de guzman under its provisions the senator who pushed the bill ramon magsaysay jr said it was aimed at future hackers once the law is implemented and a couple of people are sent to jail they may think twice mr magsaysay said but young people being who they are i 'm sure some will still try to break into databases for his part mr de guzman insisted the thrill of hacking was gone if he can not find work with a software company he said he would go into business perhaps opening a cybercafe longer term he said he would like to write a software program impervious to hackers but if somebody hacked it i would just laugh mr de guzman said without a trace of a smile i would admire them
