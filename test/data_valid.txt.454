there was the no look bounce pass to complete a three on one break there were the windmill hands that knocked the ball loose followed by the quick thinking reflex of banging it off villanova center malik allen 's knee then erick barkley lofted an alley oop pass to lavor postell and in just four minutes of play the guard rediscovered a smile that had been missing for a week he shot a no 1 finger to the roof of madison square garden he hopped on his toes as the scrawled message on his left shoe proclaimed the sophomore was free at last of the national collegiate athletic association 's suspension just as the box score showed the rust barkley battled 16 points on 6 of 16 shooting it also showed the energy and joy that the guard brought after his return from a two game suspension for violating an ncaa regulation against extra benefits seven assists seven steals and just as st john 's needed barkley to beat villanova 78 75 in a tense second half in which the teams exchanged leads four times and were tied seven others barkley needed a forum afterward to assure fans and observers that he was not a bad kid from new york i was more worried about my reputation barkley said of his weeklong ordeal i thought i was going to be labeled as a kid from new york the bad kid from new york but it did n't turn out like that my reputation stayed the same and i 'm just happy it did soon after the red storm 's anthony glover smothered villanova 's gary buchanan as the wildcat guard tried to put up a game tying shot with 33 seconds left barkley offered an equally complete defense of how last saturday he was declared ineligible for swapping cars with a family friend he said that he met on feb 2 with an ncaa investigator whose intentions were not clear to him or the st john 's lawyer who monitored the interview the investigator asked if he had a car he told the investigator he had a 1996 jeep cherokee that belonged to his brother then barkley said he volunteered that he had recently swapped with a family friend for a 1995 chevrolet suburban the reason for a switch with a rucker league coach whom barkley had known since he was 14 the cherokee seats three the suburban was bigger barkley said i used it to take my teammates out i did n't think i did or have done anything wrong when i left the meeting i thought this was going to be over tomorrow in fact it was n't over until last thursday when an ncaa subcommittee on student athletic reinstatement appeals sliced one game off the suspension the five member panel of educators and administrators heard in a two hour conference call how the suburban 's windshield wipers and odometer did not work that it got fewer miles per gallon of gas and could not possibly be worth more than the cherokee so barkley was eligible for yesterday 's game but even playing with barkley before 15208 at the garden the red storm struggled with villanova in the second half the wildcats 13 9 over all and 4 6 in the big east repeatedly dumped the ball inside to the 6 foot 10 inch allen and watched him arc soft turnaround jumpers or running hooks over the undersize red storm 's interior i just got deeper in the lane in the second half and found my rhythm said allen who had 17 of his 25 points in the second half with 1 minute 10 seconds left allen turned into the lane and hit a one handed runner to cut st john 's lead to 72 71 and it looked as if the red storm might lose another game down the stretch it has been the team 's bumbled final minutes that have accounted for four of its six losses most recently against syracuse and ohio state but yesterday st john 's 16 6 8 3 bore down glover drove the baseline and double pumped over allen for his 13th point of the game postell hit three of four foul shots in the last 214 seconds and everyone played defense still ahead by 78 75 with 33 seconds left the wildcats had a final chance to reach overtime they inbounded the ball from beneath their own basket and immediately found buchanan in the left corner he jumped for the 3 point attempt but glover pinned the ball on the way up and it rolled out of bounds the disappointing thing is we played good enough to win villanova coach steve lappas said instead it was a victory for st john 's a team that despite the distractions has won its last three games they were must have victories coach mike jarvis said if the red storm is to make the ncaa tournament after the game barkley shrugged off his uneven performance and talked about how he discovered what was important to him over the past week he skipped a practice on monday because basketball did not seem as important as his reputation he also shot down any suggestions that he might turn professional he said that he loved st john 's and the college game too much and that he understood he might not be strong enough physically for the national basketball association it hurt me a lot barkley said everyone should be guilty until proven innocent this has helped me grow up quicker and help me mature more basically that 's all i can say about it
