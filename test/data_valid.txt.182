james blake got his standing ovation last night at arthur ashe stadium he did not get his upset of roger federer the wimbledon champion the ovation came when blake held serve after weathering 8 break points 10 deuces and a great deal of federer brilliance it was a remarkable effort and the fans knew what blake had accomplished as they roared and roared the rub was that it was only the third game of the second set federer can make even straightforward tasks appear difficult for his opponents and the pressure he applied nearly from the start of this well attended match at the united states open eventually wore down blake the quick and eager american blake played well superbly at times but federer won this third round match 6 3 7 6 4 6 3 he just played too good blake ranked 35th said he played big on the big points which somebody with that much confidence after winning wimbledon is sort of expected to do it was a first week for gifted men to play up to expectations for the first time in 21 years at a grand slam event the top eight seeded players reached the fourth round this was blake 's first match against the second seeded federer who introduced blake to the full range of his talents federer mixed his serves and speeds hit forehand and backhand winners at full stretch hit clever lobs without warning and pushed forward with predatory grace to knock off low and high volleys federer also covered the court remarkably well the pro blake crowd 's reaction was telling federer won the fans respect winner by winner and flourish by flourish and several of his better efforts were met with murmurs of appreciation federer looked vulnerable only when he served for the second set at 5 4 blake broke him with a series of high risk backhands blake then held his serve after a struggle but struggles were the rule on his serve in the second set alone he faced 20 break points saving 19 but after federer pushed the set into a tie breaker he jumped to a 5 2 lead with an overhead then closed it with a service winner his serve is very effective with how much he changes it up blake said the range of his first serves go from the mid 80 's to the high 120 's he hits his spots really well and even when you feel you have looks at it he changes it up so much that it 's difficult to return he 's a guy who makes you play a little worse than you should until now david nalbandian of argentina had been one of the few to make federer play worse than he should and he will be federer 's opponent in the fourth round nalbandian seeded 13th defeated mark philippoussis in four sets yesterday he has won all four meetings with federer on the professional circuit including their fourth round match at the australian open this year i beat him in juniors once federer said with a laugh but i also lost to him in juniors here at the us open in the finals
