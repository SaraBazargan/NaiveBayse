josef svoboda a czech stage designer who combined an architect 's precision a technician 's ingenuity and an artist 's vision to evoke magically imaginary worlds in more than 700 theatrical productions died on april 8 in prague he was 81 jarka m burian his biographer said he apparently died of prostate or kidney cancer after being ill for nearly a year mr svoboda 's innovative approach honed in small prague theaters and the world 's great opera houses first caught the attention of the north american public at the czechoslovakian pavilion at expo 67 in montreal live performers intercepted the image of a ball on a screen and it would become a real one they would toss it back and it would become an image again but his approach was also seen in the bold stark designs he did for the metropolitan opera 's productions of carmen and les vepres siciliennes as well as sets he designed for the grand opera in paris the royal opera house in london the burgtheater of vienna and the berlin opera he cooperated with the world 's leading directors including laurence olivier giorgio strehler and milos forman he designed three completely different sets for wagner 's ring cycle one each for convent garden geneva and an ancient roman theater in orange france in 1966 when he had about 300 productions behind him an article in the times of london called him the world 's leading scenic designer mr svoboda 's formidable bag of tricks included film and video screens giant mirrors sheet metal surfaces suspended above the stage and scenery that moved from place to place but sometimes if it seemed right for the production his sole decoration could be as simple as the silhouette of skyline he likened scenery to an instrument in the orchestra mr burian said sometimes it is silent and sometimes it is the most important part of the visual symphony scenery mr svoboda said is not an end in itself but a logical component of the complementary arts of the stage the scenic artist collaborates on equal terms with the author and the director he was born on may 10 1920 in the small town of caslav about 30 miles from prague his father was a maker of fine cabinets and persuaded his son to follow that craft instead of becoming a painter of pictures as the young man had hoped he held a one man show of his paintings when he was 15 the family moved to prague in 1939 the year germany made that city and the rest of bohemia a protectorate mr svoboda could not study liberal arts as he had planned because the nazis closed the universities so he studied interior design for a year after the war he studied architecture at the school of industrial and fine arts and began working as a set designer while a student there he later taught architecture at the school for the 20 years ending in 1990 he never designed buildings but once said that his greatest regret was not having designed a theater after the war he and some friends including the director alfred radok began the fifth of may theater in 1951 he became chief designer and technical director for the national theater he was one of the earliest theater artists to bring film and slide projections on to the stage though the german use of abstract projections dated back to the 1920 's in 1958 he mr radok and others created laterna magika or magic lantern a multimedia performance group that combined ballet and pantomime with film art one of its productions kouzelny cirkus or magic circus has been performed 5000 times in prague and in 14 other countries mr svoboda is survived by his wife libuse and his daughter sarka hejnova of prague his love of experimentation led him to use video screens in 1965 in 1972 he began to explore the theatrical potential of lasers though he refused to embrace communism he used assignments from the government to test new technical methods the government did not give us money specifically for this development he said of the concept he presented at expo 67 they gave us money for the dissemination of political propaganda at the czech pavilion but we used the money to advance our new technique for decades mr svoboda designed the sets for 15 or more productions a year reviews varied writing in the new york times in 1976 the music critic harold c schonberg described mr svoboda 's set for the metropolitan opera 's production of verdi 's otello this way the set is highly stylized and severe largely in horizontal planes and it works beautifully two years earlier clive barnes theater critic for the times had said that mr svoboda 's settings for tom stoppard 's jumpers were heavy glossy and soulless but scores and scores of his sets were memorable from the silver hanging cords masquerading as walls and forests he designed for olivier 's production of chekhov 's three sisters to a production in which he used slanting mirrors to enable actors to float like insects the daily telegraph recalled the elaborate designs he made for a london production of straus 's frau ohne schatten in 1967 two sopranos were injured when they fell off stairs linking different stage levels and mr svoboda himself suffered a concussion after falling eight feet
