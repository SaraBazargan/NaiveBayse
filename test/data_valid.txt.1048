to the editor in a victory for gay marriage editorial nov 20 you say that the massachusetts ban on gay marriage struck down by the state 's highest court is simply about prejudice the court concluded much like state laws barring interracial marriage but the two differ profoundly the union between a man and a woman is the means by which the human animal survives this union has been formalized in virtually all cultures throughout history i feel that the word marriage should continue to be used to designate a unique and basic institution in human history i have no problem with giving same sex unions the same rights as those who are in a traditional marriage but they are clearly different and deserve a different name morris johnson brooklyn nov 20 2003
