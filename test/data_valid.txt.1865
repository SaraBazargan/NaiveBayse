recent performances of american ballet theater 's production of swan lake featured a new hero and a new villain on thursday night at the metropolitan opera house when david lamarche conducted nina ananiashvili was once again compelling in the dual role of odette and odile this time her prince siegfried was maxim belotserkovsky a hero with a sunny disposition once mr belotserkovsky encountered ms ananiashvili 's odette his gallantry increased when he again met ms ananiashvili this time as odile the evil sorcerer 's daughter their black swan pas de deux was grand in scale yet free of affectation paloma herrera and marcelo gomes repeated their fine interpretations of the leading roles on friday night when andrew mogrelia conducted but ethan stiefel wildly exaggerated his movements as von rothbart the sorcerer this production divides the part into two having one dancer reveal the villain 's bestial nature while another adopts a noble disguise although brian reeder was convincingly beastly it was hard to understand how mr stiefel could have fooled anyone his jumps were impressively high but his gestures were abrupt and coarse and his constant ogling of the court ladies grew comic instead of looking like a sinister aristocrat this rothbart resembled a barker at a carnival sideshow
