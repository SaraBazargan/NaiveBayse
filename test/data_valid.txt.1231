to the editor re defaults sound alarm about money funds feb 11 which discussed the potential for risk in money market mutual funds that invest in riskier short term investments like commercial paper i 'm in a unique position to know that commercial paper had no part in money funds at the industry 's inception since my partner and i created the first money market fund the reserve fund in october 1971 to this day none of reserve 's money funds have ever invested in commercial paper my hope is that the money funds that are reaching for yield and buying commercial paper are doing their own credit analysis because the commercial rating agencies did n't give much warning about the problems with the two california utilities that defaulted earlier this year bruce r bent new york city feb 12 the writer is founder and chairman of the reserve funds
