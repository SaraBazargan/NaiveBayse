a fire last night at a major sewage treatment plant in sheepshead bay sent a putrid smell drifting across brooklyn officials said more than 200 firefighters responded to the fire which broke out shortly after 7 pm fire officials declared it under control nearly four hours later people miles away reported a foul stench apparently from the fire the cause of the fire at the 113 year old coney island sewage treatment plant had not been determined last night according to fire department and city department of environmental protection officials they said the plant remained in operation throughout the evening eliminating the risk that raw sewage would be discharged into the ocean the officials said there was little chance the fumes from the fire posed a health risk to nearby residents nonetheless fire officials on the scene advised people living near the plant at 2591 knapp street to keep their windows closed as the fire was being fought early last night despite official reassurances several people described the ordeal of extremely thick smoke billowing through the neighborhood and said they remained worried about the health consequences your eyes watered and your throat was burning said kathryn segal a neighborhood resident another resident wayne liebman said the smoke had made him vomit he struggled to compare the odor to something comparably offensive it was worse than burning tar worse than rubber he said it was a nauseating thick eerie murky chokeable cloud firefighter james long a department spokesman said 14 firefighters had been taken to nearby hospitals for treatment of minor injuries charles sturken a spokesman for the department of environmental protection said the fire had broken out in a system designed to control odors from the plant the system is composed in part of carbon filters which are difficult to put out once they catch fire he said it 's like trying to put out charcoal briquets he said they are burning embers he said the firefighters job was complicated because of the design of the system which included fans that would normally suck foul smelling gases into the carbon filters once the fire had started he said the fans provided fuel for the flames mr sturken said the plant which opened in 1890 was the oldest in the city and one of the oldest in the nation and is used to treat sewage and storm runoff from most of central brooklyn he said the plant was rebuilt in 1996 to include the odor control system that was on fire last night he said the biggest risk of a fire at a sewage treatment plant involves chlorine which is used in the chemical process that transforms sewage into effluent clean enough to release into public waterways if the chlorine caught fire it would pose far more serious health hazards but mr sturken said last night that no chlorine had been released into the air and that the most severe threat concerned whether the odor control system on the plant would be quickly restored to normal use until it is he said residents of the area might be forced to endure an odor of sulfur or rotten eggs from the plant he added that the odor problem was being complicated last night by the high humidity that accompanied thunderstorms in much of the region yesterday the humidity might keep odors lingering in the air for some time he said
