as the airlines prepared to start baggage procedures to reduce the risk of bombing experts predicted only modest improvements in security and hoped for only modest schedule disruptions airline officials were nervously optimistic today that they could operate on friday without major delays as they began under a deadline imposed by congress some form of baggage screening for every piece of checked luggage mostly they will check that on the first flight of each passenger 's trip no bag is loaded into a cargo hold without its owner being on board they may also clear a bag by having a dog sniff it or by running it through a machine that detects explosives or by searching it by hand aviation experts say that the baggage rule and other steps taken since sept 11 have improved security but that holes remain a good security system is a multilayered interdependent system said billie h vincent who was chief of security at the federal aviation administration in the late 1980 's none of the layers are expected to be 100 percent effective but taken in the aggregate they have a better chance of 100 percent effectiveness but mr vincent said that even all of the measures now planned would fall short and some deadlines would probably be missed in fact some deadlines that are ostensibly being met on friday will be missed in certain aspects bags for example will be matched only at the point of departure leaving open the possibility that a terrorist could buy a ticket that required a change of planes board the first leg and skip the second letting the suitcase and bomb go without the terrorist it does nothing to block suicide bombers a point noted by many people who fly including secretary of transportation norman y mineta in another case of a deadline not quite met a guidance document due on friday from the aviation agency on how airlines should train pilots and flight attendants for coping with security threats will be delivered but it is missing a crucial component a report on the feasibility of carrying guns or nonlethal weapons congress set friday the 60th day after the new aviation security law was signed as the deadline for some form of baggage screening and the transportation department has responded by picking a course that is incomplete but probably achievable and declaring it has complied senator john d rockefeller iv the west virginia democrat who is chairman of an aviation subcommittee said he would hold a hearing next week on whether the limited bag matching met the intent of the new law mr vincent estimated that 90 percent of the screening would consist of the partial bag matching dogs he and others said can detect tiny amounts of explosives but they tire quickly or get bored and do not always tell their handlers when they have quit work hand searching is too slow to keep up with the flow of bags the explosive detection machines can cost more than 1 million each sometimes can not be installed without rebuilding part of the airport and because they are cumbersome to use sometimes sit idle speaking about the requirement that bags be matched with passengers before the first takeoff of a trip carol b hallett the chief executive of the air transport association said we are hopeful there really will not be any change from what has been in existence over the last couple of months but in the next breath ms hallett said there have been days when it 's been pretty horrific because of security breaches in the past her organization had lobbied against bag matching and airlines argued that it would cause delays at their hubs the airlines appear to have won the argument in the sense that matching bags will not be required on connections american airlines the nation 's largest said it anticipates efficiently processing passengers through security and launching flights on time american said it began 100 percent bag matching on tuesday the system 's capacity to tolerate disruption has increased somewhat because the skies are less crowded the air transport association said today that the number of passengers boarding planes in december was 142 percent lower than in december 2000 other security improvements are taking hold the number of armed undercover air marshals in place is small but growing and all major airlines have installed doors that are harder to break down the next step already taken by some airlines is doors that are impenetrable to bullets and bombs airlines now have 60 days to propose a training program to the transportation department the details are secret but jane f garvey the head of the aviation administration said this really shifts the strategy from a training program that has been much more passive to one that is much more active the plan does not tell the airlines whether to issue stun guns or other nonlethal weapons or whether to train pilots to maneuver their airplanes to make hijackers fall over but it does lay out what kinds of training crews would need if those strategies were adopted suit challenges screeners rule los angeles ap jan 17 the american civil liberties union filed a federal lawsuit today challenging the constitutionality of a provision in the new airport security law that requires all baggage screeners to be american citizens the suit claims that the law discriminates against noncitizens who represent more than half the screeners at some california airports
