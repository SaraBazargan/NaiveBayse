ever since the renaissance spawned the set of ideas that coalesced as the modern concept of democracy western leaders have told themselves that the political creed to which they adhere and which to a great extent has conquered the modern world is the most elastic the most accommodating and therefore the most enduring implicit in democracy 's allure is an impressive history of assimilation from virtually every region of the world in america the irish the italians the chinese and the poles arrived in earlier waves and more recently the latin americans the iranians the arabs the indians and africans have followed have made their way to most of the western democracies indeed part of the legitimacy of democracy has been its openness and its ability to flourish wherever the institutions of civil society law and governing take hold today however as waves of immigration have crested ever higher from failed states dictatorships and from desperately poor or stultifying regions of eastern europe latin america the middle east asia and africa democracy 's shining city on a hill may seem at least to those seeking entry guarded by concertina wire and no entry signs the campaign against terrorism has created additional barriers to entry and forced western leaders to emphasize that democracy itself is not anti muslim nonetheless some leaders see the rise of religious fundamentalism as a threat this month president jacques chirac of france has decried the tyranny of creeping religious displays headscarves crosses and skull caps as an assault on secular democratic ideals in france could these pressures one day undermine democracy if so what would replace it timothy john stevens the anglican bishop of leicester whose constituency 100 miles north of london in the british midlands is 40 percent south asian both hindus and muslims and east african says he does not feel a sense of alarm for democracy nor does he doubt the inevitability of assimilation down the generations of course there are examples of immigrants who are not well assimilated he added and the rampant fundamentalism of recent years has been terrifying but these are not features of democratic decline he asserts i do n't think it is prudent for the british people to lecture anyone on the virtues of assimilation the bishop added given that we spent much of the last several hundred years in the guise of empire avoiding being assimilated into other people 's cultures michael mandelbaum an expert on foreign affairs at johns hopkins university argues that democracy and assimilation are not the same the former is a political system and the latter is a social phenomenon albeit one that can affect how a democracy functions democracy works best he says in a relatively homogenous society and therefore what is roiling the west is disequilibrium high rates of immigration that overwhelm democratic institutions that need time to integrate new members of society i do n't think headscarves threaten democracy professor mandelbaum said but certainly it can reflect a social problem that may be difficult for democracies to reconcile like the cleavages of bosnia chechnya or iraq the reality is that democracies can and have failed and there are still competitors out there say islamic rule or asian autocracy built on confucius buddha or marx i still think democracy is ascendant professor mandelbaum says in no small part because nothing else has worked out very well
