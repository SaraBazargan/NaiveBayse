to the surprise of many seasoned washington veterans congress has gotten off to a fast start meeting president bush 's goal of creating a new domestic security agency this year the white house has even had to acknowledge sheepishly that while mr bush was racing around the country urging lawmakers to act immediately the administration had not yet finished drafting a bill for them to pass posturing aside both parties seem to realize that they can not go empty handed before voters anxious about terrorist attacks a quirk of fate has cast two improbable politicians as the players to watch on homeland issues in coming months one is senator joseph lieberman of connecticut chairman of the governmental affairs committee and a democrat who wants to be president that means mr lieberman will push the bush administration on the soft spots of its proposals even as he reminds everyone that the new department was originally his own idea with the failure of the white house to draw up legislation it was too busy fighting the idea until recently mr lieberman can be expected to use the bill he has already passed in committee as the basis for whatever the senate wants done in the house the main player is representative dick armey a texas republican who is retiring from congress after this year like mr lieberman he knows that the legislative kingpins are worried about losing power over the agencies they oversee from their committees and reluctant to let them go into another jurisdiction for example don young of alaska chairman of the transportation and infrastructure committee wants to keep the coast guard in the transportation department it 's important to his state 's boaters and fishermen you see that sort of thinking wo n't do mr armey a respected tactician will have to be the one to knock heads and make deals to get the job done mr bush 's proposal is for 22 agencies scattered through the bureaucracy to be merged into one new department with a 375 billion budget since the plan was drafted in secrecy in the white house basement by a handful of presidential aides congress has both a right and responsibility to look carefully at the details and ask questions for instance why must the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms which is concerned about illegal weapons be kept in the treasury department can the entire merger be carried out with absolutely no additional funds as the white house is demanding some concerns raised in congress seem silly at first until you think about them would moving the plant and animal inspectors out of the agriculture department to the homeland agency give short shrift to food safety do we want tom ridge or whomever to be the one worrying about citrus canker blighting florida 's oranges or mad cow disease another problem has to do with the civil liberties implications of creating what could become the equivalent of a european style or even third world style home ministry all powerful and overseeing state and local police functions mr armey calls it the issue of security federalism mr armey a conservative has a libertarian 's distrust about enhancing the government 's intrusive police powers that echoes the concerns of some on the other side of the political spectrum to help congress along mr bush needs to be a little humble since he was the one obstructing the efforts to create a homeland department as recently as two weeks ago he should try to be receptive if congress has a good idea about changing his plans both the white house and the public must treat all congressional questions seriously if they arise from genuine concern about the national good the committee chairmen obsessed with protecting their turf however will have to look elsewhere for sympathy
