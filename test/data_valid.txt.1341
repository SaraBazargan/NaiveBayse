there may be no other street in manhattan with the echoes of the 1960 's of st marks place in the east village the facade of the old electric circus still glows blue memories of the fillmore east waft around the corner maybe it 's faint but the cafes t shirt shops and hole in the wall clothes and craft boutiques not to mention the famous bookstore are still dimly redolent of the tie dyed anarchy of the notorious past walking st marks on the way to theater 80 the home of the pearl theater company any new yorker who has been around long enough will feel appropriately relocated in time and spirit for the pearl 's revival of exit the king a loopy tragedy by eugene ionesco written in 1963 that the company says has not been presented in new york since 1968 not that the play or the street has gone out of date like the flower in a gun barrel revolution that lives palpably on st marks place for anyone who remembers it and in a more ghostly sense for anyone who does n't ionesco 's story of an elderly monarch of a fraying kingdom facing his demise remains both hilariously and grimly effective like the street though the play now exists in an atmosphere that is less buzzy and electric with philosophical ambivalence that lacks the general sense of life 's lunacy that pervaded the 1960 's a feeling that was presciently announced in the absurdist theater of beckett ionesco and others the tenor of our times does n't seem to acknowledge that the desperation that characterizes life on earth is a source of humor as well as anguish the world has become a more earnest place over the past few decades and certainly the horror of the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon suggest a kind of anarchy loose in the world that no one finds in the least funny and it is this contemporary spirit that infuses the pearl 's production which as directed by joseph hardy makes the throne an office chair and dresses the characters in a vaguely contemporary style including the king who wears a tie and whose robe is a long raincoat and a servant girl in blue jeans and the story is told with a general competence but the production misses the complex crosshatching that ionesco 's melding of tragedy and farce requires it builds to a rather moving conclusion robert hock as the doomed monarch berenger i turns in an increasingly touching performance as he finally succumbs to his inevitable fate but far too rarely does mr hardy mr hock or any other cast member find a way to exploit the playwright 's humor ionesco was not shy in his broad symbolic undertones nor in his understanding that human preposterousness is frequently an outgrowth of misguided sincerity in exit the king he makes his symbolic intentions clear by divulging in dialogue that the king 's life has encompassed the human experience that he has been alive for centuries that his reign has included great victories in battle as well as great nincompoop mistakes berenger has long had the illusion of immortality and his impending death takes him by surprise he mourns how he 's wasted a lifetime that has passed in a seeming moment in a fourth wall violation that also sets up the play as an artifice it is revealed to him at the start that at the end of the play he 's done for the characters serve the play as a kind of representative society walled inside the palace they include the king 's two wives marguerite carol schultz the elder is a battle ax whose no nonsense attitude is that the king stop fooling around and accept his fate and the young and foxy marie celeste ciulla is the voice of foolish hope whose counsel to her husband is never to yield berenger is attended by a doctor ray virta whose bedside manner is distinctly lacking in compassion and he is trailed about by juliette a servant sue jin song whose laments about her life of nonprivilege are accepted without sympathy by all the final character is a guard michael nichols who makes intermittent pronouncements about the king 's declining condition marie 's name now means nothing to the king as if he were a town crier facing the wrong way it is in other words a fable both goofy and admonitory and here mr hardy has allowed miscalculatedly the goofiness to speak for itself he has evidently reined in his actors because there is minimal effort in any of the performances toward the hyperbole of absurdist intent but it is also true that none of the performers appears especially comfortable with comedy the line readings particularly of mr virta ms schultz and ms song are especially deaf to humorous possibility and in the lead mr hock who enters barefoot and shambling with the absent mindedness that is familiar from plays and films that deal in realistic portrayals about the old generally has trouble finding original comic notes his performance takes on power as the play moves on and his predicament becomes ever more dire whether or not this is the result of purposeful understatement the laughs that ought to make exit the king a painful stitch just are n't there it makes the difference between the communicated message is n't life absurd and the much more immediate and profound are n't we absurd it 's the difference between being there and being nostalgic exit the king by eugene ionesco translated by donald watson directed by joseph hardy stage manager lisa ledwich set by beowulf boritt costumes by
