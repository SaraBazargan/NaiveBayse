thirteen states from all regions of the country will try to impose new national controls on pollution from truck and bus engines on monday when they announce a plan to jointly adopt emission limits that would be far stricter than the federal rules state air pollution officials say they are acting because they can toughen the rules faster than the federal environmental protection agency will at least in the next few years the agency agrees we support this backstop move said robert w perciasepe the head of the epa 's air pollution program his agency is preparing an even stricter rule but it would not take effect until 2007 at the earliest the states action comes as the manufacturers of heavy duty diesel engines are jointly asking the clinton administration to modify a previous agreement to clean up their engines they also want to reshape the final federal rules for 2007 the details of the rules are not yet certain states have acted jointly before notably in the reagan years to force manufacturers of gasoline powered vehicles into stricter tailpipe emission limits than washington was demanding but those states comprised only california which drafted the standards and a group of states from virginia north to maine on monday a more diverse group will try again to bring other states around to a california pollution standard this time nevada texas georgia and north carolina will join new york new jersey and connecticut as well as massachusetts new hampshire maine vermont and rhode island organizers say the states represent about 40 percent of the market for new trucks our hope is with these states joining california we will create the critical mass that will result in the engine manufacturers deciding to manufacture just one truck model and it would be a much cleaner truck said s william becker the executive director of two groups that seek to coordinate policy below the federal level the state and territorial air pollution program administrators and the association of local air pollution control officials mr becker and others expect opposition from the manufacturers and trucking associations although several manufacturers declined to take a position before the states announcement at one of those navistar international truck and engine ron wiley a spokesman said that his company was waiting to see the final form of the california rule the states are moving to close a loophole that will open in epa regulations because of delays at the agency in promulgating new federal rules the gap began with a landmark settlement in 1998 in which seven large diesel engine manufacturers were accused by the agency of producing about a million engines that were designed to pass pollution tests in a laboratory but then run dirtier on the highway producing more pollution than permitted to settle the case the manufacturers who produce most of the heavy duty diesel engines agreed to pay 1 billion in penalties they also agreed to put in effect in their 2002 model year engines a standard that the epa planned to take effect in 2004 but after the consent decree was signed the epa failed to take the steps required to put the rule in place for all manufacturers in 2004 the result is the prospect that when the consent decree expires the companies will again produce dirtier engines at least through 2005 and 2006 but the clean air act gives california the state with the most severe air pollution the right to draft its own emission rules and gives other states the option to adopt them the original plan was for the epa to do this said jerry martin a spokesman for the california air resources board we ca n't afford to allow these companies to backslide and build dirtier trucks so california developed its own rules which it plans to adopt soon it is eager to have other states join it mr martin said because about a quarter of the trucks on california 's roads are registered elsewhere and because california does not want to put its own trucking companies at a competitive disadvantage the air resources board predicts cost increases of 700 to 800 for trucks with an average cost of 52000 to 108000
