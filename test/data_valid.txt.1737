the lawyers for zacarias moussaoui said their client the man identified by prosecutors as the 20th hijacker in the sept 11 attacks might be mentally ill and should not be allowed to defend himself at trial without a sweeping psychiatric examination to determine his competence in a motion filed this afternoon in federal court in alexandria va the lawyers sought to counter an apparent a readiness by both the judge and the prosecutors to acquiesce quickly to mr moussaoui 's demand on monday to fire them and represent himself in their motion the lawyers cited some of mr moussaoui 's comments in his occasionally rambling 50 minute speech before judge leonie m brinkema mr moussaoui expressed contempt for the court appointed lawyers and said he believed they were in league with the government in a mission to execute him what they have done is a sophisticated version of the troy horse or the kiss of death he said greed fame and vanity is their motivation their game is deception in their filing today the lawyers said that any defendant who believes that his lawyers were plotting to have him executed was probably irrational and suffering from mental problems if he believes that about his lawyers they said it could not possibly then be said that the defendant is competent to make a knowing and voluntary decision to waive the right to the assistance of counsel edward b macmahon jr one of the lawyers said that the fundamental point of our motion is to get the judge to take a closer look i do n't believe you could have listened to mr moussaoui on monday and not had concerns as to whether he was holding rational beliefs about counsel 's role in this matter mr macmahon said adding i do n't think it 's my job to decide whether he 's rational in the political beliefs that he holds but if he thinks that defense counsel is a trojan horse that 's acting to carry out his demise then that 's an inherently irrational position for him to take mr moussaoui is charged with conspiring in the sept 11 terror attacks prosecutors contend that he would have been the 20th hijacker if he were not arrested a month before on an immigration violation on monday judge brinkema ordered a swift routine mental examination of mr moussaoui and said she was inclined to allow him to represent himself i will say that from what i 've seen in court today that you appear to know and understand what you 're doing she told him as i said you are very bright judge brinkema who seemed eager to accommodate mr moussaoui also said she would arrange for a visit by a psychiatrist as soon as possible and at this point she said unless the doctor comes up with something i will find on this record that this is a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel robert a spencer one of the prosecutors said i see no objection to having a competency evaluation done in alexandria on a quick time schedule and it might give the court some peace of mind in allowing him to represent himself but in their filing today the defense lawyers objected to a quick examination the competency examination they said must find out if mr moussaoui truly believes they are in a conspiracy to harm him and whether that is a result of paranoia or some other mental condition no psychiatrist or psychologist could possibly answer this question in one short session with mr moussaoui and nothing more they said the lawyers also said that the supreme court had set a higher competency threshold for someone to represent himself than for simply standing trial represented by a lawyer in their filing today the defense lawyers also disclosed that mr moussaoui had already tried to act as his own lawyer they said he contacted the prosecutors and asked to meet about how he could have access to classified documents that could be used in his defense the defense lawyers asked judge brinkema to prohibit the prosecutors from contact with mr moussaoui until there has been a determination of his competence the defense lawyers also objected to judge brinkema 's statement that if she allowed mr moussaoui to represent himself she would ask them to remain involved to provide him help if he asks for it they said that no one who believed his lawyers were out to see him executed should be required to accept their participation even as standby lawyers
