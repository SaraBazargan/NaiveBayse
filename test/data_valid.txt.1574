scarsdale residents and builders will no longer be able to push their lots to the limit now that village officials have approved a new law that caps the size of homes based on their lot sizes village trustees on tuesday voted 6 0 to approve a plan that limits the size of new or remodeled homes based on their individual lot sizes the law which resulted from nearly two years of study and debate stems from officials desire to curb the construction of so called mcmansions homes that many view as simply too big for their lots and though opponents have said the law will unfairly curtail homeowners who want to expand or upgrade their homes village leaders say the law enables residents to do just that while making sure properties stay in proportion to their neighborhoods there 's a lot of freedom and a lot of openness built into this said mayor david kroenlein while this does provide some control over oversized houses it does not impair the ability or architects or homeowners to produce creative design in keeping with the spirit of what scarsdale architecture is about the law which will apply to each of the village 's approximately 5600 homes will be enforced using a formula that calculates the ratio of a home 's floor area to its lot size for example a 3500 square foot house would be allowed on a 10000 square foot lot under the plan but on a lot double that size 20000 square feet the size of a home would be capped at 5200 square feet bob harrison a fox meadows area neighbor who recently fought the construction of two new homes on what was previously a single lot said the law did take steps toward fighting building big homes on small lots but the law has its flaws he said for example the law should have reduced the height limit on houses on smaller lots he said though all future construction will have to abide by the new law the rules will be evaluated periodically to make sure they are working mayor kroenlein said in addition residents with exceptional circumstances will be able to appeal for variances
