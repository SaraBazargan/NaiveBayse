horace mann school is facing tough opposition to a plan to expand its 18 acre campus of stone buildings and rolling green lawns even though the expansion involves only a few feet in two directions one of them up the prep school wants to replace an existing cafeteria and auditorium building with a new structure that would house a library offices and a theater the school hopes to break ground in june for a gable roofed building with two gothic towers with completion set for september 2002 but some riverdale residents argue that the school and its nearly 2000 students already impose on the neighborhood and that more construction would make a bad situation worse on their list of complaints are school buses that they say pollute their air and students who park in their driveways loiter in their front yards and litter their roads even worse residents say is that for years the school has failed to honor its promise to correct the problems with these issues in mind the land use committee of community board 8 voted overwhelmingly two weeks ago not to support the project citing increased traffic and zoning restrictions the portion of the proposed building housing the theater which would contain a fly loft for hoisting scenery is several feet higher in places than the current building the city planning commission will rule in a vew months on a zoning variance even the opponents agree the new building is better but they add it 's not good enough and herein lies the problem according to school officials we came up with plans to increase on campus parking but then people complained we 'd be paving over green and taking away trees said robert j katz chairman of the board of trustees it 's frustrating because you realize you just ca n't make everybody happy the truth mr katz says is that as a dominant presence in the neighborhood horace mann is an easy target still he is hopeful these are long standing concerns and we intend to fix them he said i know a lot of promises may have been made and not kept but this is a new day hope reeves
