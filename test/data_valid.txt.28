capping off a trying year marred by layoffs lawsuits and a tougher consumer market for sodas the coca cola company announced a sharp rebound in fourth quarter earnings yesterday but its sluggish sales raised questions about whether it has enough momentum to accomplish the full turnaround it has pledged for 2001 given coke 's lackluster growth of little more than 1 percent last year in soda sales in the united states the company will have a hard time pulling off the 6 percent to 7 percent gains it has promised wall street analysts said emanuel goldman an analyst with ing barings in san francisco expressed skepticism about whether coke could reach the peak of its estimates to do seven is not exactly like climbing mount everest he said but it is kilimanjaro for the fourth quarter coke 's earnings met analysts expectations which have been tempered by patience over the wholesale revamping that it has just finished with coke now freed from distractions analysts say it needs to return quickly to the type of results that drew investors like children with a sweet tooth for much of the last decade yesterday 's announcement suggested that a reversal in the company 's fortunes may take a little longer than hoped persistent weakness in foreign currencies like the euro the south african rand and the australian dollar caused coke revenues most of which come from outside the united states to fall to 49 billion for the quarter a drop of about 1 percent from 1999 despite the stagnation in sales operating income for the quarter rose to 839 million more than twice what it was in the year before when the company endured a huge write off of its assets in india with fewer such exceptional charges and a somewhat unexpected lift from investments in its bottlers coke 's net income for the quarter reached 242 million compared with a 45 million loss for the similar period the previous year the company met analysts revised earnings expectations of 38 cents a share up from 31 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1999 in trading on the new york stock exchange the value of coke 's stock rose 9 cents a share yesterday to 58 though an improvement over the company 's performance earlier last year the results signaled a slowing of the momentum that coke began to build in the third quarter of 2000 when net income rose 26 percent but by december it became apparent the company 's sales volume a critical measure of how much soft drink makers persuade consumers to buy would rise only 44 percent for the year falling short of the 5 to 6 percent target coke officials steadfastly defended for much of 2000 we almost delivered on that gary fayard coke 's chief financial officer said in a conference call with analysts and reporters yesterday and we did it in the face of restructuring the business putting a new management team in place and settling a discrimination lawsuit eager to put the turmoil of 2000 behind them coke officials said that they would concentrate this year on getting coke in the right place principally through the kind of assertive marketing campaigns that coke was once known for but has been failed to stage in recent years in the last two months coke has turned to a single collection of agencies the interpublic group of companies to bring coherence to what had been a diffuse and often confusing advertising strategy investors have been eagerly anticipating the next wave of commercials hoping it will help end the inertia in soda sales but the beginning of the campaign is still several months away we 're going at 180 miles an hour to get it out there jack l stahl coke 's president said coke officials also said that they would continue to pursue their forays into noncarbonated beverages which grew 11 percent last year more than twice as fast as sales of diet coke and coke around the world given the slowdown in the american economy few coke followers expect to see much improvement in the current quarter but by midyear many anticipate a significant upswing in the tempo of coke 's sales and profits
