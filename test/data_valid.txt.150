ash wednesday by ethan hawke 221 pages alfred a knopf 2295 there 's no use pretending this book was written by some unknown guy named ethan it 's impossible to read ash wednesday the second novel by the actor ethan hawke without an image of the author hovering over the book in all his familiar guises playing the morally searching detective in training day or the young romantic in before sunrise as gossip column fodder or interview subject quizzed about his marriage to uma thurman if he were just another sincere nobody the novel would not be receiving a shred of the attention it is but then this book and his first the hottest state would n't have been subjected to the unusual hostility that has sometimes greeted them either as if critics were offended that he dared to write at all there 's every reason for skepticism when celebrities branch out they often cross a line between ambition and star driven hubris the singer jewel 's poetry enough said but in both his novels mr hawke falls safely on the side of ambition in this road story about two young lovers a pregnant woman and the man who dumped her but now wants to marry her he displays a novelist 's innate gifts he has a sharp eye a fluid storytelling voice and the imagination to create complicated individuals he is weaker at narrative tricks that can be taught like putting distance between himself and his characters jimmy heartsock and christy walker are average people a 29 year old army sergeant and a 26 year old who works in the social services department of a hospital yet they look at the world and speak in metaphors inexplicably as articulate as their creator the andersons front yard looked like a frozen over version of satan 's lair jimmy says which is probably not language he picked up in the army ash wednesday is not a perfect novel or a major one but it is absorbing and thoughtful observant and witty with enough delicately crafted flashes to justify its existence well beyond its author 's hollywood fame it is not subtle but you do n't name your socked in the heart hero jimmy heartsock if you 're going for subtlety when jimmy breaks up with christy without knowing she is pregnant she gets on a bus in albany and heads home to texas jimmy goes awol and catches up with her at the first stop as they drive in his souped up old chevy nova from new york toward texas he tries to convince her and at times himself that he wants to be a husband and father that story is a slender frame allowing mr hawke to explore his characters and his characters to grapple with their future jimmy and christy narrate alternating chapters each picking up the tale where the other left off and gracefully filling in their family histories some of mr hawke 's best scenes involve the family background that has shaped and scarred the couple jimmy joined the army after his father a mentally troubled vietnam veteran committed suicide christy was abandoned by her mother as an infant and has never forgiven her father for letting her run away to new york at 17 in an especially poignant tough minded scene christy recalls first meeting her mother when she was 14 christy was sitting in a woolworth 's drinking a vanilla coke when a woman with auburn hair pulled up tight in a bun walked in introduced herself as her mother and gave her some excuses and a locket the woman reached over and gently caressed my arm i wanted to swat her away christy says the second i walked out i threw the locket away as jimmy and christy try to sort out their relationship they talk about life love and spirituality in a way that often drags the novel down the book is full of the adolescent philosophizing that people in their late 20 's should have outgrown sitting in a howard johnson in times square they have what seems an endless conversation about religion identity and creating a home do n't get all cocky about this but being with you is the closest i 've ever come to a sensation that i was someplace authentic christy says she goes on to compare beliefs to fence posts it 's all pretty arbitrary is n't it honestly it ca n't be that all the hindus are going to heaven and the rest of us are screwed to the wall can it passing through his hometown in ohio jimmy visits a priest he knew as a boy and tells him my life has never been in the service of anything except chasing after my own thrills you know it 's not surprising that mr hawke 's major influences seem to include the salinger and kerouac works beloved by adolescents his characters are overgrown adolescents self absorbed and self conscious groping for a way to become grown ups still there 's too much navel gazing here that only a lover or a priest could put up with but the narrative picks up near the end when the couple reach new orleans at mardi gras which coincides with their greatest crisis as they head into the crowd on fat tuesday a hotel clerk warns them to be off the street by midnight when ash wednesday begins and he pointedly says the party stops with parenthood and its responsibilities looming jimmy and christy are definitely facing the end of the party the question is whether they will embrace adulthood and walk into it together at times mr hawke gives jimmy startling clarity still trying to persuade christy to make her life with him he tells her near the end listen to this i 'll say it i 'm gon na have affairs it 's not arrogance but a brave honesty we hear in his voice as he adds we spend 50 years together and some bad stuff is gon na go down but you ca n't stop fighting you ca n't let go in this novel of love and redemption such moments of passion and lucidity make it easy to forgive all its ponderous moments
