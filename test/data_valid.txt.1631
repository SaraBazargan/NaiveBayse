for the last several months the new york city opera seemed to have the inside track on becoming the cultural anchor at the world trade center site but today the corporation overseeing downtown redevelopment is planning to invite arts groups from all over the world to submit proposals suggesting that a place for city opera is not secured the same goes for the museum of freedom which had already received a commitment of support from american express today 's expected invitation from the lower manhattan development corporation seems intended to send the message that decisions about a cultural element at ground zero will not be based on personal political or professional connections we want to cast a broad net to see what 's out there said kevin m rampe the new president of the development corporation no decisions have been made kate d levin the new york city cultural affairs commissioner said there is an appropriate inclination to make this a celebration of us culture at the same time it is important to recognize that culturally the us is part of a reciprocal universe said mr rampe we 're doing outreach to cultural organizations in the city nationally and internationally to ensure we get the broadest possible scope of interest john c whitehead chairman of the development corporation is an opera fan enthusiastic about having city opera at ground zero in march mr whitehead said that while there had been no final decision about the opera company i would say it looks favorable irwin schneiderman the city opera chairman was out of the country last week and could not be reached for comment but in a recent interview he said that if a major cultural center was to be built at ground zero they need an anchor like us tom a bernstein who proposed the concept of a museum of freedom is president of the chelsea piers recreation complex roland w betts founder of chelsea piers is also a director of the lower manhattan development corporation mr bernstein said that he was comfortable with the prospect of competition it 's all part of an open process he said and we plan to respond with other interested parties the overall plan for the world trade center site designed by the architect daniel libeskind provides for a performing arts center and a museum more than 400000 square feet are dedicated to cultural uses on the site plan and mr rampe said the development corporation wanted to create a feeling of round the clock activity in its invitation the corporation is asking cultural groups to submit detailed suggestions for programming and information about their mission community outreach and educational programs it is also requesting financial information about construction budgets experience with capital campaigns and potential contributions to economic development on the site mr rampe would not specify the financial contribution that the corporation expected to make toward a cultural component except to say that it would be significant people close to the process estimated that amount at 200 million to 300 million but the invitation warns groups not to assume any financial help from the corporation and it asks organizations to show they can sustain themselves we want to make sure these institutions can be vibrant on an ongoing basis mr rampe said in considering proposals the corporation will look at small and large organizations mr rampe said the joyce theater for example has expressed interest in being part of a performing arts complex adding the downtown site to its stages in chelsea and soho the development corporation is also interested in groups that want to provide programming without relocating to the site submissions will be evaluated jointly by the corporation the new york city department of cultural affairs and the new york state council on the arts mr rampe said that he planned to narrow the field by september partly because the development corporation would be refining the master site plan in october there may well be ideas that have n't been heard ms levin said we are doing this to make sure any organization that might be interested has the opportunity to try and make their case a museum is almost certain to be one element of cultural development at ground zero mr rampe said but the content and management of such an institution has not been determined mr bernstein 's museum of freedom would include an exhibition devoted to the sept 11 attacks and others that address freedom in general the museum of the city of new york and the new york historical society are also interested in being part of a new museum at the site the performing arts center appears to be up for grabs city opera has clearly stated its desire to leave lincoln center for ground zero because its home there at the new york state theater was designed for dance and muffles sound city opera has not established how it could afford such a relocation alone given that it shares upkeep of the state theater with the new york city ballet and has a deficit of about 35 million the philanthropist robert w wilson had offered 50 million toward a new building for city opera but he has said he would not support a move downtown in addition a poll of 800 downtown residents taken in may indicated that they did not think city opera should be a priority of cultural development in the area the poll found that respondents preferred the idea of a multipurpose cultural complex that could also serve as a community and recreation center similar to the 92nd street y or a multiuse performing arts center for music dance and theater like the brooklyn academy of music the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent an opera house is not what the community chooses said madelyn wils chairwoman of community board 1 in lower manhattan and a director of the lower manhattan development corporation i think what this shows is that city opera is not going to serve local residents considerable questions also remain as to whether city opera 's audience would follow that company downtown although the opera hoped to draw new audiences from brooklyn and new jersey mr rampe said that an audience for some kind of cultural component seemed assured we 're planning for 10 million visitors a year to the memorial he said referring to another component of the redeveloped site that makes it easy to bring audiences down for cultural events
