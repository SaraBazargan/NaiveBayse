now that the democrats have taken control of nassau county 's legislative branch for the first time in memory the question for many around this fiscally troubled county is what happens now to begin to answer that question the new democratic leadership of the county legislature released what they are calling a blueprint for their first 30 days in office most of the initiatives have one goal finding ways to pull the county out of its budget woes to that end the leaders said they would hire a fiscal analyst renew their push for an outside monitor to oversee the county 's finances and hold hearings on wasteful government practices judith a jacobs the legislature 's new presiding officer acknowledged that some people were impatient for change and she asked for a little time we have been the majority for two days so far she noted the first order of business she said will be to look for short term solutions to plug a gap in the county 's current budget which could grow to 190 million the state comptroller h carl mccall said last week then ms jacobs said the leadership will try to tackle a number of bigger problems as they formulate a longer three  to five year plan that would address what she said were systemic problems with the county 's budgetary process one of the biggest of the big ticket items that the democrats said they would look at is the county 's antiquated tax assessment system the system which federal prosecutors say discriminates against minority property owners costs the county hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to people who successfully challenge their assessments the county is fighting several lawsuits against the system that democrats say nassau will likely lose this is one of the biggest contributors to the county 's deficit said legislator roger h corbin a democrat who has long advocated overhauling the system the democrats set a march 1 deadline to hear from a panel that was appointed by their republican predecessors to study the issue the new democratic majority also said it would hold public hearings to try to find out why the county 's police probation and correction departments spend so much on overtime this is costing the county millions legislator lisanne g altmann said ms altmann noted that to cut back overtime among correction officers the county will need to move quickly to name a new sheriff a post that has been vacant for months the democrats called on county executive thomas s gulotta to give them an update on the search within the next two weeks and to forward a candidate to vote on by the end of the month although the county executive chooses the sheriff the legislature confirms the appointment there were a few non budgetary items on their agenda ms jacobs said that she would re introduce legislation that would give the county 's human rights commission the power to investigate discrimination based on sexual orientation and the democrats pledged to hold meetings of the legislature in each of the county 's three towns above all they asked for a little patience it took years to get the county into the mess it is in now ms jacobs said and it will take years to get us out
