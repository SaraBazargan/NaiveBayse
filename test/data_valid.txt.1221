tom davis business rock creek ranch location deer lodge valley in western montana number of employees six cowboys and three hired hands for fencing irrigation and other chores annual revenue not near enough to cover the expenses ranching is something to occupy your time said a laconic tom davis who took over as manager of the rock creek ranch from his father there 's sure as hell no money in it the price of imports drives our market down and fuel and labor and machinery are going up the rock creek ranch set in a broad valley at the foot of the snow covered flint creek range operates 2800 breeding cows on 40000 deeded acres and 35000 acres leased from the federal government the market price for a calf is 350 to 400 and the calf costs 475 to 500 to raise with 6 to 8 million worth of land mr davis said that 's not a good investment ranchers are going out of business in droves he said and the ones hanging on are borrowing against their land land appreciates and they can keep borrowing he said land that they bought for 15 to 20 an acre is now 400 an acre to enhance their income many ranchers have tried raising specialty meat to supplement profits from beef everything from emu to elk to bison which is what mr davis has tried but buffaloes have not proven their worth as the market has crashed two years ago i sold a bred cow bison for 4000 he said now i ca n't get 400 a lot of people have tried supplemental income but no one 's come up with the right combination to add to the difficulties wolves have returned to the area and the average loss of 1 1 2 percent of the year 's calf crop has risen to 4 1 2 and 5 percent baby calves are like a sack lunch to these wolves mr davis said they clean out the bones and everything the wolf is expected to lose its protected status which will allow cowboys to shoot them and that should help finding good hands can also be a problem you ca n't get someone to stay in the woods anymore it 's hard to find anybody who wants to work and do manual labor for all the hardships mr davis and his wife vickie and son jim are not contemplating anything else ranching he said is more than a job it 's a way of life it may not be lucrative he added but it earns him enough to live on without fighting the hustle and bustle of the city jim robbins
