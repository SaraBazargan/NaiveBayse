the brazilian singer gal costa was the official host and headliner of a show at carnegie hall on tuesday night but the evening felt misdirected ms costa is in her late 50 's now and her voice is n't too far from how it sounded in her 20 's when she was a fledgling bossa nova singer and then part of the musical and cultural movement called tropicalia it 's clear and soft and lovely with age it has become slightly richer less transparent and when she sang antonio carlos jobim 's desafinado at a slow tempo she revealed her powers she filled out the words joining them up and showing her mastery over the song the problem was that there were n't enough of these moments ms costa appeared with a largely new york based group not her own touring ensemble and there was nothing particularly gripping about the group 's sound the rubric for the evening was a tribute to jobim and stan getz for which ms costa seems a perfect candidate she knows jobim 's work well which for the purpose of the evening also encompasses most of what getz recorded with joao and astrud gilberto she has come to represent brazilian popular music as well as any living singer but compared with her other recent appearances in new york when she came with working bands playing current music this felt perfunctory and devoid of deeper pleasures at one point during a long absence from the stage to make way for guest performers she was nearly upstaged when the trio morelenbaum2 sakamoto finished its five song segment at the end of the first half it was clear that ms costa had a crowd to win back the singer paula morelenbaum the cellist jaques morelenbaum and the pianist ryuichi sakamoto delivered jobim songs exactly as they did on their recent album casa and with a sense of almost holy rapture whatever you think of their versions which are imbued with impressionist harmonies and an almost classical style of singing whether you think they 're chilly or warm their concept for reimagining jobim felt undeniably brave and strong the second half of the concert crowded with underwhelming guests and suggesting a lack of prepared material was a disappointment the pianist cesar camargo mariano and the guitarist romero lubambo played a few jobim songs alternating between ballad tenderness and fast chugging tempos the guitarist john pizzarelli made an awkward gesture of american cool out of so danco samba michael feinstein who knows why sang gershwin 's shall we dance to bossa nova rhythm ms costa performed the girl from ipanema at the end of course syncopating the lyrics and making them swing and then all hands including the tenor saxophonist tom scott who had appeared through the evening for solos that channeled getz 's velvety tone if not his melodic inventions appeared in an encore to sing a felicidade for a second encore they ran through the same song again
