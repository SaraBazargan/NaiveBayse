some years ago after it became clear that my husband 's fate was to be a father of girls he decided to mess with nature the two eldest were still toddlers when he brought home a set of cardboard blocks designed to look like bricks within minutes his plans to build a fort from which he could command his cowboys to defend against outlaws went badly awry instead his daughters placed the blocks in neat rows and draped cloth napkins across their mid sections they 're playing day care center and the blocks are babies in cribs he reported he looked badly shaken they want me to put a block on my shoulder and burp it next he tried water pistols the girls wrote their names in water against a wall he even brought home a motorized robot kit he ended up assembling it while the girls designed furniture for its use a droid does not need a coffee table he complained a droid blows things up for a while i thought my husband had given up on his dream of captivating his girls with his favorite boy toys then one day last week i walked into the kitchen and tripped like lucille ball over a tiny radio controlled car that was zipping past the dishwasher the dinky red mazda rx 7 careered around a water bowl with the dog in feverish pursuit my turn shrieked clementine 5 trying to wrest the controls from ella 11 mom she hit me put her in her room ella said tell them to share the car said zoe 13 my husband crouched under the table propping a playing card on a matchbox ramp he explained he wore the smug grin of a man who finally had found a toy with irresistible cross gender and cross species appeal and at that moment in early november i realized i was facing a terrible holiday shopping dilemma it was too early to think about christmas but these two and a half inch cars with miniature motors which are making their american debut this year at sticker prices that range from 1999 to 3999 after enjoying success in asia could solve a lot of gift buying problems nieces nephews even my brothers would like them i could even picture my father who never wants anything playing with one my quandary did i need to hurry to buy some little cars online now if they proved a runaway holiday best seller they 'd become scarce later on the other hand if the marketplace became flooded with unwanted inventory radio shack and hobbico are distributing dueling versions nationwide i could pick them up later at huge discounts how do you predict holiday toy hits i asked sean mcgowan managing director at gerard klauer mattison an investment research firm it 's like the movie industry he said you just do n't know very often the one everybody thinks will be the big hit is but sometimes it 's a little movie out of left field instead with the furby craze for instance those in the know in the toy industry were predicting a hit months ahead of its introduction but then there was tickle me elmo the doll that originally looked like such a holiday dud that it got discounted right after thanksgiving then it became a hit mr mcgowan said the rule of thumb buy any hot toy on your shopping list this year 's top sellers so far include chicken dance elmo and yu gi oh trading cards as early as possible even a best seller from an established company that should be able to predict demand like rapunzel barbie from mattel could be in short supply in a few weeks mattel has been cutting back on shipments because they want to create the perception that products like these are scarce mr mcgowan said what about radio controlled cars i asked it turned out mr mcgowan has a relative who is already buying up all the radio shack cars in her neighborhood the store only has a couple at a time so she just buys them all he said her kids are wild about them and their friends are wild about them that was all i needed to hear but which cars should i buy the radio shack zipzaps 1999 apiece or hobbico 's r c microsizers from street prices as low as 2999 to a recommended sticker price of 3999 and from which site you have a drop dead date when those toys you ordered have to arrive by christmas so make sure the site actually has the product in stock instead of on back order said frank catalano a toy consultant who works with the toy industry association for control freaks like me that means phoning a toll free number to confirm even after a site has assured me that a product is in stock this phone call also gives me a chance to discuss the fine points of the return policy recipients should be able to return gifts to bricks and mortar stores for a full refund also i like to track a shipment 's physical progress from the warehouse to its destination somehow it comforts me if a package is delayed to at least know it has been sitting ignored in a dusty corner of a warehouse in oakland calif it gives me the illusion of control if the situation does n't improve by say dec 22 i could at least drive to oakland and make a fuss in the parking lot my husband 's little car was one of the more expensive hobbico microsizers but in cases like this i gravitate toward the cheaper alternative so i went to radioshackcom where i was unhappy to learn that zipzaps are in such short supply they are currently not available online last week before they stopped selling them on the site radio shack was unable to guarantee customers model choices was radio shack already having distribution problems my husband had reported separately to me that the cars were sold out in a radio shack store in san francisco that he visited last week the decision to stop selling online has a lot to do with the lack of available zipzaps it is such a hot product right now we are literally selling out said kay jackson the director of media relations for radio shack we 're trying our best to meet demand good luck in the meantime i went to microsizerscom to see a list of online retailers who sell them toysruscom where my husband had bought his for 2999 had no stock in inventory toys 'r us will have this item for the holidays promised tina fulkerson hobbico 's assistant product manager but kbtoyscom had the cars at a higher price 3499 i ordered a zillion of them gift wrapped next my youngest daughter wants a rapunzel barbie to play with daddy i predict he 'll tuck the doll under his arm and aim her at outlaws online shopper e mail slatalla nytimescom
