name recognition was never cheap but this year it has become more expensive than ever spending at a clip of 300000 a day an unknown wall street multimillionaire introduced himself this spring to the voters of new jersey and last week after investing a record 35 million nearly all of it his own money jon s corzine won the democratic primary for the seat being vacated by senator frank r lautenberg another multimillionaire who used his personal fortune as a launching pad to the united states senate mr corzine 's victory over former gov jim florio is the most recent reminder that in america these days candidates must spend enormous sums either their own or money they have collected if they hope to have even a remote chance to be elected to the congress or the presidency it is nearly impossible for candidates to win armed only with ideas but little or no money americans have two choices said charles lewis executive director of the center for public integrity we can either elect rich bored multimillionaires or plastic figures with perpetual smiles on their faces who are bought and paid for by special interests mr corzine the former co chairman of goldman sachs company who is worth an estimated 400 million shattered all spending records for a senate primary he spent 14150 for each of his 247351 votes an amount that experts say is extraordinarily high mr florio spent a meager by comparison 25 million or 1389 a vote mr florio repeatedly accused mr corzine of trying to buy the election by spending obscene sums but mr corzine defended his expenditures as necessary for a political novice running against a household name like mr florio 's make no mistake i want to invest in america mr corzine shouted to the crowd at his primary victory celebration tuesday night at a hotel ballroom in east brunswick nj that 's what this campaign will be about a congressional campaign 's largest expense is media commercials because new jersey has no widely watched television stations of its own candidates are forced to advertise on stations in new york city the nation 's most expensive media market and philadelphia the nation 's fourth most expensive market to put mr corzine 's 35 million war chest in context he spent nearly as much in his primary bid as the combined total spent in 1998 by senator alfonse m d'amato and his challenger charles e schumer in their fight for a senate seat at the time it was the most expensive senate race in new york history though the record will most likely be broken this year still mr corzine 's jaw dropping spending spree should not come as much of a surprise in a year when gov george w bush of texas has already spent a record 73 million to win the republican presidential nomination and experts estimate that a record 3 billion will be spent on the 2000 presidential and congressional elections it 's obvious why the regular person does n't even bother to run said fred wertheimer president of democracy 21 and former president of common cause who helped shape the post watergate laws that govern today 's campaigns the gulf between winning well financed candidates and their underfinanced opponents just continues to grow mr wertheimer said and that gulf greatly narrows the pool of individuals in this country who are prepared to become candidates any potential candidate is faced with the huge costs of campaigns the big advantage your incumbent opponent starts out with in terms of surplus funds and the fact that the only place you can turn to is personal wealth or donors who want something in return in 1998 94 incumbents in the house of representatives ran unopposed the highest number in 40 years an additional 114 incumbents ran against challengers who had raised less than 25000 a study by common cause found for all practical purposes nearly half of the house races in 1998 involved incumbents who ran unopposed or with no threat of losing in florida 18 of the 23 house incumbents seeking re election ran unopposed including 12 republicans and six democrats this year strategists say only three dozen highly contested house races are likely or for less than 10 percent of the 435 seats they attribute the few competitive races to the extraordinary advantage that the current campaign finance system gives to incumbents who can raise money with relative ease that leaves only self financed candidates with the ability to get in the game candidates who spend millions of their own money lose more often than they win in 1994 michael huffington poured nearly 30 million almost all of it his own money into his unsuccessful bid to defeat dianne feinstein for a california senate seat and al checchi a california airline executive set the record for any statewide primary when he spent 38 million of his fortune in his failed gubernatorial bid in 1998 rarely do candidates who are outspent by wide margins win but in long island in 1992 rick lazio unseated incumbent representative thomas j downey even though mr lazio was outspent by a five to one margin mr downey was hurt by mr downey 's overdrafts at the house bank it is difficult to judge if mr corzine 's victory was attributable more to his 35 million investment or new jersey voters disgust with mr florio 's 28 billion tax increase as governor in 1990 in the general election mr corzine will run against robert d franks a four term republican congressman from union county in his victory speech last week mr franks borrowed a line of mr florio 's to begin his campaign against mr corzine good evening new jersey i 'm bob franks the candidate with experience that money ca n't buy meantime mr corzine will continue to add to his record well said larry makinson executive director of the center for responsive politics when you 've broken the record for the most spending ever and there 's still five months to go until november you 've left the stratosphere and entered the ionosphere
