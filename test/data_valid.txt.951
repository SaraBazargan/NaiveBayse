the resignation of richard a grasso as chairman of the new york stock exchange has created a once in a generation opportunity to improve the exchange 's commitment and ability to serve the public interest but if the board and management of the exchange close ranks and resist further change investors will know that they can expect business as usual in the post grasso era how will we know whether the exchange is serious about reform look for action in three crucial areas the exchange 's board its management and its transparency the first step for the exchange is to diversify its board of directors the days when the big board could be governed for and by a small group of specialists members regional brokerages and listed companies should be long gone yet their interests along with those of the huge financial conglomerates still predominate a majority of the directors as well as the board 's chairman should be from outside the industry at the very least the compensation committee ought to consist solely of outside directors institutional investors shareholder activists academics the same constituencies who have had such an impact on reforming the boards of public corporations in recent years should be given a greater voice the structure of the exchange must also be made more efficient with management duties separate from regulatory functions the regulatory function should be pristine set apart from the business concerns of the exchange and the influence of its members its managers or other industry insiders the exchange should name a chief regulator who would report directly to a committee of independent non industry directors meanwhile a chief executive could oversee the exchange 's business affairs and serve as head cheerleader and administrator finally the exchange needs to open up its books last week 's fiasco has only underscored the degree to which the investing public is ignorant of how the exchange is run much greater transparency is essential if the public is to have faith in the stewardship of management and the board at a minimum the exchange should disclose its revenues and earnings go public with its management and governance structure and reveal how it goes about nominating candidates for its board these requirements are no more than what the exchange itself demands from the companies it lists remember this is an institution that has considered becoming a public company itself clearly that idea should be forgotten until the exchange demonstrates its willingness to conduct its affairs in the light of day as necessary and obvious as these changes may be they will not be easy for the exchange to swallow those who have been running the exchange for generations would have to cede control to outsiders who serve the investing public 's interests before those of the financial industry this opportunity to reconsider the institution its function and its responsibility to society can not be squandered the new york stock exchange is an integral part of a capital system that has made america the envy of the world it is no accident that most technological breakthroughs come from the united states in part because of the exchange american companies have the funds they need to innovate grow and start whole new industries now we must restructure the exchange so that we can maintain and enhance its vitality and credibility we can only hope that the current board having acted wisely and ethically in seeking mr grasso 's removal will follow its impulse for reform to its logical conclusion op ed contributor muriel siebert the first woman to own a seat on the new york stock exchange is chairwoman and chief executive of siebert financial corp
