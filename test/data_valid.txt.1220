five days before the most expensive election in american history top officials of the republican and democratic parties were still scrambling to raise huge sums of money today asking some top donors for checks as large as 1 million in recent days gov george w bush of texas and vice president al gore have placed calls to large contributors thanking them for their gifts campaign officials said the candidates calls were quickly followed by pleas from fund raisers for even more money to pay for get out the vote efforts and last minute television commercials in battleground states republicans have maintained a 2 to 1 cash advantage in the campaign 's closing days but spending by labor unions on behalf of democrats as well as advertising underwritten by various liberal organizations has helped to narrow the gap every check counts in a presidential election that analysts expect to be among the closest in decades and small checks of 25 and 50 continue to pour in to the parties headquarters here both the democrats and republicans received record setting amounts of money from direct mail appeals on tuesday party officials said envelopes bearing more than 22 million arrived at republican offices that day the democrats received 11 million the large unlimited donations known as soft money also have cascaded into national party committees republican and democratic national fund raising committees have raised a total of 3929 million in soft money since the beginning of 1999 nearly twice the 207 million in unrestricted donations raised by the parties over the same period before the 1996 presidential election common cause reported today since january 1999 the republicans have raised 2142 million in soft money for the presidential and congressional campaigns and the democrats have raised 1787 million the group reported in addition the parties have collected more than 430 million in so called hard money the smaller donations that are limited in size but can be spent for virtually any political purpose the republicans have a substantial edge in this category too outraising the democrats by 275 million to 157 million so far this election cycle according to federal election records several fund raisers said the democratic party had managed to narrow this traditional republican advantage especially since the democratic national convention in los angeles in august the record shattering cash flow is still not enough to pay for the parties final push on the airwaves and on the streets as of today the democratic national committee had just 10 million left in the bank while the republican national committee had 225 million there is a continuing mad dash for donations going on today and it is far more intense at this late stage in the election than it has been in previous years a senior republican fund raiser said a democratic finance official said all the goals have been exceeded but they 're still pounding the pavement for more people keep giving too because the race is so close the republicans planned to spend 10 million on last minute television advertisements which will run primarily in battleground states like pennsylvania florida and california the democrats have allocated 9 million for their 11th hour television messages both parties as well as allied groups including the sierra club the united states chamber of commerce and the national rifle association are also spending millions on get out the vote drives over the next four days they range from leafletting and door to door canvassing to high tech narrowly aimed appeals by e mail and cable television by the time the polls close next tuesday the major parties are likely to have spent everything they have in the bank today and then some a republican official said that the party did not expect to be in debt after the election and was counting on receipts from a direct mail appeal to finance the final push democrats are prospecting for large and small contributions to match the republicans spending and to avoid going deep into debt after the election the republican national committee has easily shattered its targets for both hard and soft money the democrats have exceeded their hard money expectations and are on pace to meet its goal for soft money campaign finance experts predicted last year that total spending on this year 's congressional and presidential races could exceed 3 billion if spending continues at its current pace that estimate will be exceeded experts say in the next five days each campaign will spend about 10 million on radio and television advertising in 17 to 22 battleground states for example the republicans have spent several million dollars on ads in california but the democrats have not yet committed any money to commercials there most california polls show that mr bush has cut into mr gore 's lead in the state both parties have also spent millions of dollars in florida whose 25 electoral votes could tip the balance both parties have also spent considerable sums on ads in tossup states including washington tennessee and arkansas but spending by the parties and the candidates is only part of the equation advocacy groups business alliances and trade unions are pouring millions of dollars and thousands of volunteers into the final hours of the contest the afl cio expects to spend 46 million this year on political activities and has dispatched 980 coordinators to 10 contested states to rally union members to vote for mr gore and other democratic candidates union officials said in all organized labor will spend as much as 75 million in this election virtually all of it on democratic candidates according to a top democratic fund raiser the gore campaign is counting on a muscular effort to get union voters to the polls countering the push by big labor is the united states chamber of commerce which has raised nearly 25 million from its members to pay for a broad effort to reach business owners by mail telephone the internet and workplace contacts said william c miller jr the chamber 's political director the chamber 's political spending this year is several times what it has spent in the past mr miller said while the group has endorsed a handful of conservative democratic candidates for congress most of its spending benefits mr bush and republican congressional candidates liberal interest and advocacy groups planned parenthood handgun control inc the national abortion and reproductive rights action league emily 's list the sierra club and the naacp are pouring additional millions of dollars into advertising and voter drives for democratic candidates citizens for better medicare a group largely underwritten by the pharmaceutical industry has been spending more than a million dollars a week this fall on behalf of congressional candidates who share the industry 's views on prescription drug benefits under medicare they are almost all republicans
