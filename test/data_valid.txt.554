i woke up feeling intensely guilty when i was young i used to go into a dark box at church and confess all kinds of guilt about talking back to my parents about unkindnesses about impure thoughts but now i feel guilty about just one thing not being a millionaire on the glowing boxes of my adulthood the tv and computer people are constantly getting rich quick when time warner merged with aol some predicted the end of print and my life passed before my eyes but i was far more disturbed that i had lost yet another opportunity to cash in or to cash out i worked at time in the early 80 's the magazine was not on the cutting edge of technology then when time made the computer man of the year in 1982 we were still pounding out our stories on typewriters i did n't hold onto my time stock and on monday many of my old colleagues became multimillionaires if there 's a way to lose money i 'll find it i called a washington psychoanalyst named justin frank i told him i did n't want to feel deeply inadequate just because i did n't know how to day trade he confessed his own feelings of inadequacy as a psychoanalyst i subjectively feel like a dinosaur because i am exploring things in depth and in the meantime everyone around me has gotten rich yesterday i was driving somewhere and my children said 'dad you 're smart and funny and hip why did n't you invest in internet stocks what 's wrong with you i told them 'i 'll take this under advisement we are moving into an era of decisiveness as opposed to an era of thoughtfulness people feel guilty if they have a subconscious identification with hamlet to trade or not to trade i never cared about money before it was not what country joe and the fish taught me to value once upon a time money was an occasion for guilt the robber barons who had exploited the poor would cleanse their lucre by buying great art or pouring it into charity the guilted age but now the only remorse that people feel about money is why have n't they made more once new money tried to disguise itself as old money says michael lewis who wrote the new new thing about a silicon valley billionaire it gave some of itself away it dressed itself up in airs and pretensions now old money cringes in the face of new money now even new money gets stale fast and has a sell by date we are obsessed about making money with our money making an honest living does not seem like a particularly sensible thing to do anymore when you can simply hold onto a stock that rises to the stratosphere i have never seen so many disgruntled people at the peak of a bull market says james stewart the author of den of thieves about the wall street scandals of the 80 's who is now an editor at smart money people look at their portfolios going up 40 percent last year and they are whining and complaining to me that they did n't own qualcomm they do n't even know what qualcomm makes if they had qualcomm they whine they wish they had more of it everybody brags about their gains nobody talks about their losses as a subject for boasting portfolios have supplanted sports and sex jim cramer the money manager who founded thestreetcom agrees people used to be mortified to talk about how much money they made now they get in my face and say 'i caught 79 points on oracle what did you catch in the old days you had to be intrepid or an mba to get in on a gold rush now your personal trainer knows as much about one day price movements as warren buffett it 's not like a land grab where you had to go out west brave native americans and horrible rains and run into the donner party mr cramer says you do n't have to brave anything at all you just have to have a predilection not to sell so the generation that prided itself on its idealism has finally found its true signature and the question that the children will ask is what did you do in the bull market daddy
