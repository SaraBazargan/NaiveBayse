i 've always loved film noir the grays the shadows the mysterious webs of murder deception and corruption the morally ambiguous characters but i never expected to see a noir shadow fall on the white marble hive of washington the film noir hero as nicholas christopher wrote descends into an underworld on a spiral the object of his quest is elusive and he is beset by agents of a larger design of which he is only dimly aware george w bush began as a president of simple precepts of right and wrong a leader who predicted his major foreign affairs challenges would be russia and china he has suddenly been drawn into a murky labyrinth from the caves of central asia to the casbahs of the middle east where he must trade in global grays to win strategic advantages our capital is clammy paranoid about what comes next how we should combat enemies we ca n't easily locate detect or vanquish who may use tactics and weapons against which we have little protection we are in blair witch territory letting our imaginations filigree the unknown and unseen bracing for the next terrible thing embarrassed by their impotence in stopping the sept 11 attack the freaked out fbi and cia now cover themselves by issuing blanket warnings telling congress there is a strong chance america will be attacked again by islamic sleeper agents once we retaliate against osama bin laden and revealing to cnn that they are picking up the same patterns and language you will be happy soon from terrorists under surveillance that were prevalent before sept 11 washingtonians jumpy about germs and gases are creating safe rooms in their houses meeting with security experts and clearing out pharmacies of antibiotics there were other echoes of israeli style precautions at the capitol and the supreme court they were putting protective film on windows in the subway they were removing trash cans and recycling bins senators who yawned at bioterrorism warnings before the attack are falling all over each other to hold hearings on the subject but their chicken little come lately cries do not reassure us that the bureaucratic rivalries and lapses in immigration and airline security that contributed to the monumental intelligence failure wo n't happen again and they ca n't tell the public what it most yearns to hear that we are not still just as vulnerable to another attack sept 11 was a day of crystalline certainty thousands of innocent people were dead we had to find the murderers and unleash hell but after that things got weirdly muddied we would have been prepared for a conventional war outside our borders but we were not prepared for the terrorists unconventional war inside our heads we went from never imagining the damage the barbarians inside our gates could do to imagining little else america always needs to demonize the enemy so we personalized our war around osama bin laden but his network of evil wears no uniform his soldiers dress in our clothes sleep at the comfort inn eat at pizza hut and shop at wal mart at his senate confirmation hearings to be bush defense secretary donald rumsfeld talked about the lessons of vietnam let 's try not to get into things we ca n't get out of he said let 's try not to get into things we ca n't finish well the last thing this country wanted was to be pulled into another hostile unfamiliar landscape or more political quicksand even in our national discourse we rejected ambiguities preferring the thumbs up thumbs down who 's in who 's out box office winner box office loser sureties but now we 're enmeshed in ambiguity first we wanted to bomb afghanistan then when we saw the suffering of the people there we wanted to send food now we may bomb them with missiles and care packages president bush is struggling with geopolitical jujitsu our old enemy russia is our new ally our old ally israel is accusing us of appeasing the arabs we have to now trust countries we distrusted like pakistan we have to hand out bribes and play footsie with those who tolerated and sheltered and exported terrorists and may again our desire for justice remains unambiguous beyond that as keats wrote there is nothing stable in the world uproar 's your only music
