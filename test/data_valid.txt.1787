do n't bring out the sock puppets just yet but there are signs of life in the online pet supply business for two years that category has been held out as the prime example of what went wrong during the dot com craze companies like petscom and others helped put a face on the e commerce lunacy the face of the petscom sock puppet and inspired lore of missteps like companies giving away 40 pound bags of dog food with free shipping now the traditional companies that preceded and survived those sites say their businesses have been helped by the internet in many cases sometimes significantly yet their praise of the web is often faint i believed a good bit of the hype for awhile said philip l francis chief executive of petsmart the industry leader among traditional pet supply retailers which withdrew a planned 115 million initial public offering for its online unit in late 2000 but before all of that i 'd believed the internet was really just a more efficient front end for a catalog and that 's what it is mr francis said petsmart which is publicly traded and sells 25 billion of pet supplies each year through its stores web site and catalog continues to rely on the web for sales but mostly to steer traffic to the stores he declined to characterize how much of its stores sales could be attributed to the web site but said the most highly used feature on petsmartcom was its store locator and mr francis said the company uses the site to sell goods that are impractical to carry in stores like dozens of varieties of 50 gallon fish tanks he said about 75 percent of the goods sold on petsmartcom were so called hard goods like these whereas in the stores those items account for just half of sales given such muted enthusiasm it is difficult to conjure the former runaway enthusiasm for the online pet supplies category which after books cd 's and toys was one of the darlings of the e commerce venture capital community hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into companies like pets com petopiacom and petstorecom in 1998 and 1999 like many dot com executives of the day in 1998 julie wainwright who left the defunct online movie e tailer reelcom to create petscom cited the 15 billion size of the pet supply industry and suggested that if online retailers could take just a small share of the market they would thrive the problem though was that few e tailers understood that dog and cat food represent nearly half of that figure and that such bulky relatively low price goods are nearly impossible to sell profitably when shipping to remote customers but as the pet supply market continues to grow the share of nonfood items grows thus lending some hope to the smaller number of companies now in the online pet supply market according to a study by the research firm business communications the total market will reach 335 billion by 2005 despite a soft economy this is a recession proof industry said colette fairchild associate editor for pet age magazine a trade publication even in a big recession people still buy for their pets it 's an emotional buy that and a number of other factors lead some other industry executives to predict that the internet could generate a more meaningful amount of money to pet supply merchants in the coming years than the 100 million in sales estimated by forrester research this year one of those executives is mike woodard senior vice president for business development for petco animal supplies the company with 13 billion in overall 2002 sales is the second biggest pet supply retailer mr woodard whose company bought petopiacom early last year and now operates the site under the petcocom name said the projected growth in overall industry sales was at least partially from a demographic bubble in the number of families with children from age 5 to 17 which is where you find the highest incidence of pet ownership moreover he said people were living longer and seniors were buying pets in greater numbers and people are postponing childbirth longer and having pets as surrogate children like many executives with an eye on the long term mr woodard says that he expects that when today 's teenagers reach their 20 's and start buying pets for their own homes they are more likely to buy a greater share of their pet supplies online while the sales growth rates of the company 's online division are much higher than the roughly 13 percent growth rate of store sales he said sales growth in the future will probably increase further mr woodard said the company which does not disclose actual online sales figures has like petsmart used the web to entice people to shop at its stores for instance he said the company recently began e mailing coupons and other promotional items to online customers when new stores open in their area as for the results of that initiative mr woodard said you ca n't put a number on it but when you look at the fact that customers who shop both online and in the stores spend more with you and then look at what that means over the lifetime of customer purchases it can be significant other pet supply executives who preceded the internet only companies said they had benefited from the estimated 100 million that these web sites poured into marketing before they shuffled off to the pet cemetery joe vollinger internet marketing manager for drs foster smith a catalog and internet pet supply retailer is one three months after petscom and petopiacom evaporated all of a sudden our online sales started to climb even faster mr vollinger said now he added online sales are way up at 35 percent of overall sales and growing the company which is named for the two veterinarians who founded it expects to sell 156 million of pet supplies and live fish this year primarily on the strength of the 38 million catalogs it will mail both the catalog and the web site drsfostersmithcom are dipping their paws into dangerous waters by selling pet food for the first time including a new brand bearing the company name the difference for this dot com though is that it is charging customers for shipping which can reach 8 for a 40 pound bag of dog food in january the company will also begin testing an auto replenishment service in which customers give the site permission to continue sending dog food vitamins treats and other supplies regularly on the issue of dog food in particular mr vollinger said the company would be watching the program closely forty pound bags of dog food mr vollinger pointed out can waste a lot of space in a warehouse and can pose difficult quality assurance issues we 're being realistic about our expectations on this he said we do n't want to end up where those other guys ended up
