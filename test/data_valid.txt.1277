following is an excerpt from president bush 's speech on monday in trenton and a transcript of the response yesterday by the senate majority leader tom daschle as recorded by the federal news service inc president bush i asked congress to give me the flexibility necessary to be able to deal with the true threats of the 21st century by being able to move the right people to the right place at the right time so we can better assure america we 're doing everything possible the house responded but the senate is more interested in special interests in washington and not interested in the security of the american people senator daschle i am very saddened by the fact that we have debated homeland security now for four weeks i have noted on several occasions that there is no reason why on a bipartisan basis this body can not work together to overcome our differences and to pass a meaningful and a substantive bill dealing with homeland security some have suggested that this delay has been politically motivated and i have said i 'm not willing to believe that in fact yesterday i said we intend to give the president benefit of the doubt over the course of the last several weeks as we have debated social security the issue of war in iraq has become more and more prominent and again as i go back to my experience in 1991 and '92 during a similar period fall and winter prior and after an election i expressed the concern that our politics and this climate could easily create a politicized environment and in so doing diminish minimize degrade the debate on an issue as grave as war no one here needs to be reminded of the consequences of war no one here should have to be admonished about politicizing the debate about war but increasingly over the course of the last several weeks reports have surfaced which have increasingly led me to believe that indeed there are those who would politicize this war i was given a report about a recommendation made by matthew dowd the pollster for the white house and the republican national committee he told a victory dinner not long ago i quote the no 1 driver for our base motivationally is this war dowd said war could be beneficial to the gop in the 2002 elections and then i quote when an issue dominates the landscape like this one it will dominate the landscape in a way that probably for a long time to come would put the republicans on a very good footing i thought well perhaps that 's a pollster perhaps pollsters are paid to say what 's best regardless of what other considerations ought to be made pollsters are paid to tell you about the politics of issues and were it left with pollsters perhaps i would n't be as concerned but then i read that andy card was asked well why did this issue come before washington and the country now why are we debating it in september where were we last year where were we last spring and mr card 's answer was from a marketing point of view you do n't introduce new products in august new products war and then i listened to reports of the vice president the vice president comes to fund raisers as he did just recently in kansas the headline written in the paper the next day about the speech he gave to that fund raiser was cheney talks about war electing taft would aid war effort and then we find a diskette discovered in lafayette park a computer diskette that was lost somewhere between a republican strategy meeting in the white house and the white house advice was given by karl rove and the quote in the disc was focus on war i guess right from the beginning i thought well first it was pollsters and then it was white house staff and then it was the vice president and all along i was asked are you concerned about whether or not this war is politicized and my answer on every occasion was yes and then the follow up question is is the white house politicizing the war and i have said without question i ca n't bring myself to believe that it is i ca n't believe any president or any administration would politicize the war but then i read in the paper this morning now even the president the president is quoted in the washington post this morning as saying that the democratic controlled senate is not interested in the security of the american people not interested in the security of the american people you tell senator inouye he 's not interested in the security of the american people you tell those who fought in vietnam and in world war ii they 're not interested in the security of the american people that is outrageous outrageous the president ought to apologize to senator inouye and every veteran who has fought in every war who is a democrat in the united states senate he ought to apologize to the american people that is wrong we ought not politicize this war we ought not politicize the rhetoric about war and life and death i was in normandy just last year i 've been in national cemeteries all over this country and i have never seen anything but stars the star of david and crosses on those markers i 've never seen republican and democrat this has got to end we 've got to get on with the business of our country we 've got to rise to a higher level our founding fathers would be embarrassed by what they 're seeing going on right now we 've got to do better than this our standard of deportment ought to be better those who died gave their lives for better than what we 're giving now so it 's not too late to end this politicization it 's not too late to forget the pollsters forget the campaign fund raisers forget making accusations about how interested in national security democrats are and let 's get this job done right let 's rise to the occasion that 's what the american people are expecting and we have to give them no less
