the republican congressional majority is working its will in the fine print of the huge appropriations bills that will detail the spending next year by a government already hobbled by a record deficit from an incumbent 's point of view the print gets no finer than the 1 billion in earmarks custom tailored pork barrel spending tucked into the enormous 470 billion budget for the labor education and health agencies fans of congressional budget politicking are familiar with the way lawmakers compete for projects that benefit their districts alone but earmarks take it one step further granting to specially favored lawmakers the ability to bypass formulas for allocating federal funds and pluck money from the budget sugarplums is a better term one notable aspect of the earmark tab is that it has quietly grown 30 fold in the years since the gop won the house in 1994 remember the contract with america 's promises of a meaner leaner government well it 's meaner if not leaner house leaders are threatening to dole out earmark money only to loyal republicans they would stiff taxpayers whose democratic representatives dared to oppose obvious flaws in the spending measure chief among those flaws is the republicans unconscionable 6 billion plus shortchanging of the leave no child behind education program which president bush used as an electoral promissory note rather than earmarking local slices of the financing pie lawmakers should use that money for the nation 's benefit for things like educating disabled students a program that will be shortchanged by over 1 billion next year or meals on wheels help for the elderly that is similarly stinted in the face of the gop 's greediness representative david obey of wisconsin the ranking democrat on the appropriations committee has a proposal too exquisite to resist mentioning why not use the 1 billion in pork to make up some of the shortfall in the president 's education promises we applaud his attempt to make pigs fly in the capitol
