nothing concedes like concession in his pre comeback valedictory address al gore unlike another defeated candidate in 1962 did not bitterly lash out at his opponents on the contrary gore rose to the historic occasion like the patriot most of us expected him to be i accept the finality of this outcome i offer my concession he said gently not flinching from the painful word this belatedly broken impasse can point us all to a new common ground vice president gore will with equally good grace on jan 6 2001 discharge his responsibility as president of the senate to chair a joint session of the house and senate to announce the official result of the vote of the electoral college and thereby to proclaim the election of the man who defeated him that 's what vice president richard nixon good naturedly did for john f kennedy in 1961 rn i detect a trend here and what vice president hubert humphrey just could not abide doing for nixon in 1969 tradition calls for the electoral result to be announced state by state and the cameras will zoom in to a close up of gore 's face when it comes to florida a medium sigh followed by discreet eye rolling would be well received that following a cordial meeting of the former political combatants should help along the process of public acceptance of george w bush the non loser who is president elect for the next few days until the naming of the cabinet dominates the news we can expect much learned hand wringing about the wound the supreme court inflicted on itself by daring to hear and to rule on the hottest political case imaginable and under record time pressure now the justices know what it 's like to write against a deadline the whole court did itself proud the close majority opinion that denied an unconstitutional recount the 7 to 2 agreement that the florida supreme court in failing to provide statewide standards for recounts had denied equal protection to all voters the vigorous dissents of the liberal quartet that partly concurred with one another all these were the products of fine legal minds thinking fast unafraid of complexity unsullied by rancor justice john paul stevens was a tad intemperate but we geezers are permitted some passion the central complaint of the losing side is that the nation 's highest court stopped the counting and then said time had run out but it was the florida supreme court that shortened the contest period from four weeks to two and reaffirmed in its slow walking response to the us supreme court 's urgent questioning the state election law 's inexorable dec 12 deadline though the rehnquist court can expect much law school derision for its activism in enforcing judicial restraint it can lick its wound by considering how much tension it saved the republic were it not for the court 's willingness to take the case and the heat internecine mud wrestling would have gone on for at least another month if gore had edged ahead in the counting of undervotes bush would have contested unexamined overvotes if the florida supremes had named a gore slate of electors the florida legislature would have named its own some electors in other states may then have been seduced into faithlessness ultimately the ever more angry dispute would have wound up in congress at the end with the gop in control of the clear majority of states we would have ended up exactly where we are today with president elect bush along the way many now reasonable opponents would have become implacable enemies and the electorate would have been not just evenly divided but angrily polarized the supreme court at some cost to its own serenity but not to its historic reputation saved us from that after the court acted gore did the right thing within 24 hours only then did the man gore called president elect play his part in the necessary coming together i hope the long wait of the last five weeks bush said will heighten a desire to move beyond the bitterness and partisanship of the recent past he reiterated gore 's theme of a common ground and drove it home with i was not elected to serve one party but to serve one nation bob herbert is on vacation
