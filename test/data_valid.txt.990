here are the clues a blue puppy a guy in a green rugby shirt and radio city music hall what is it that preschoolers want to do see blue 's clues live of course this is the theatrical version of blue 's clues the award winning nickelodeon television series in which an animated blue puppy leaves three clues that the viewers and steve the host in the rugby shirt use to solve a simple mystery the live production which opened this week embraces the same format just as steve uses a notebook to jot down clues each child entering radio city music hall receives a crayon and a notepad the mystery is finding the most spectacular place and while steve thinks it 's the world outside the television set blue disagrees but the live show differs in important ways it 's longer 75 minutes and includes new characters and songs it also features a different actor thomas mizer as steve the substitution allowed the series to continue to produce new shows we really did think of it as broadway for preschoolers because it 's a big adventure one big story and is really meant to be a theatrical experience said angela c santomero a co creator of the series and the co author with gip hoppe of the stage show the adventure includes visits to storybook forest where the audience has to help blue and steve unscramble some literary characters and to outer space where it must help steve learn the order and names of the planets this is all concocted to teach a variety of cognitive skills not to mention a little astronomy and to increase the show 's appeal to 7  and 8 year olds as well as their younger siblings there 's even a mystery with no clue the identity of the surprise guest who arrives at the show 's end it 's part of the bigger answer of what the most spectacular place is ms
