as buffalo soldiers lurches toward its fiery bloody ending there is a lull in the mayhem it is the autumn of 1989 a group of american soldiers stationed in germany woozy from the fumes of heroin cooking around them nod out in a warehouse where a television brings news of the fall of the berlin wall where is the berlin wall one of them asks another who answers that it 's in berlin yeah but where 's berlin somebody knows that it 's in germany explains that there are two countries with that name and guesses that the soldiers themselves are in the eastern one the cynical satirical premise of this film directed by gregor jordan and adapted from robert o'connor 's 1993 novel is summed up in that scene at the climax of the geopolitical struggle that dominated the second half of the 20th century according to the filmmakers the military professionals on the winning side had no clue what the whole thing was about or even where it was taking place the post vietnam united states army is depicted as a hotbed of loutishness incompetence and outright criminality the closest thing to a hero is ray elwood joaquin phoenix a supply specialist who in the tradition of joseph heller 's milo minderbinder uses his job as a taxpayer financed staging ground for black marketeering drug dealing and when the opportunity arises big time weapons trafficking his superior officers range from clueless ed harris to vicious scott glenn and the head of the local mp 's sheik mahmud bey becomes ray 's rival in a violent racially tinged turf war buffalo soldiers which was completed in the summer of 2001 opens in new york and los angeles today after having been moved on and off miramax 's release schedule several times after sept 11 2001 as american soldiers went into battle in afghanistan and then iraq it must have been hard to imagine the public embracing a scabrous anti military satire with united states forces still very much in harm 's way in iraq now might not be such a great time either miramax 's advertisements in which the stars of the american flag are rendered as dollar signs and the tagline reads steal all that you can steal have already sparked outrage in the military and elsewhere a predictable controversy is likely to ensue if buffalo soldiers were a better movie and made good on its apparent ambition to join the nihilists in uniform tradition of mike nichols 's catch 22 and robert altman 's mash then there might be something to argue about but the picture is sloppy when it should be incisive indulgent when it should be astringent and ultimately unsure of what it is mocking and in what spirit mr phoenix sullen and charming by turns almost holds the whole mess together with his loose cunning performance ray is thoroughly amoral a habitual liar and manipulator who butters up his commanding officer mr harris in the morning and cuckolds him in the afternoon but he is also curiously likable when a new immediate supervisor sgt robert e lee mr glenn decides to crack down on ray 's featherbedding and black marketing ray decides to seduce the sergeant 's daughter robyn anna paquin wise to his game she ends up seducing him and the best part of mr phoenix 's performance is the way he registers the delight of a hunter as the old song goes being captured by the game the romance between robyn and ray is clumsily lumped together with a scheme to trade weapons for heroin and the movie 's satirical potential is frittered away as it becomes a violent pulpy caper story there are some moments of keenly observed comedy like a cocktail party at which mr harris egged on by his ambitious unfaithful wife elizabeth mcgovern flatters a bored visiting general played by dean stockwell but the wit of the performances is dragged down into a quagmire of brutality and incoherence where there is peace ray muses in his voice over quoting nietzsche the warlike man attacks himself and buffalo soldiers which should have been smooth and provocative fights against itself every step of the way it claims to uncover and also means to celebrate the anarchy that percolates within a rigidly ordered institution but is itself too disorderly to make the point in a suitably interesting or infuriating manner buffalo soldiers is rated r under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian it includes heavy drug use extreme violence and frequent swearing buffalo soldiers directed by gregor jordan written by mr jordan eric axel weiss and nora maccoby based on the book by robert o'connor director of photography oliver stapleton edited by lee smith music by david holmes production designer steven jones evans produced by rainer grupe and ariane moody released by miramax films running time 95 minutes this film is rated r with joaquin phoenix ray elwood ed harris colonel berman scott glenn sergeant lee anna paquin robyn lee gabriel mann knoll leon robinson stoney dean stockwell general lancaster elizabeth mcgovern mrs berman sheik mahmud bey sergeant saad and michael pena garcia
