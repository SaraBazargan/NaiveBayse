days after delivering a broadly negative report on iraq 's cooperation with international inspectors hans blix on wednesday challenged several of the bush administration 's assertions about iraqi cheating and the notion that time was running out for disarming iraq through peaceful means in a two hour interview in his united nations offices overlooking midtown manhattan mr blix the chief chemical and biological weapons inspector seemed determined to dispel any impression that his report was intended to support the administration 's campaign to build world support for a war to disarm saddam hussein whatever we say will be used by some mr blix said adding that he had strived to be as factual and conscientious as possible i did not tailor my report to the political wishes or hopes in baghdad or washington or any other place mr blix took issue with what he said were secretary of state colin l powell 's claims that the inspectors had found that iraqi officials were hiding and moving illicit materials within and outside of iraq to prevent their discovery he said that the inspectors had reported no such incidents similarly he said he had not seen convincing evidence that iraq was sending weapons scientists to syria jordan or any other country to prevent them from being interviewed nor had he any reason to believe as president bush charged in his state of the union speech that iraqi agents were posing as scientists he further disputed the bush administration 's allegations that his inspection agency might have been penetrated by iraqi agents and that sensitive information might have been leaked to baghdad compromising the inspections finally he said he had seen no persuasive indications of iraqi ties to al qaeda which mr bush also mentioned in his speech there are other states where there appear to be stronger links such as afghanistan mr blix said noting that he had no intelligence reports on this issue it 's bad enough that iraq may have weapons of mass destruction more broadly he challenged president bush 's argument that military action is needed to avoid the risk of a sept 11 style attack by terrorists wielding nuclear biological or chemical weapons the world is far less dangerous today than it was during the cold war he said when the soviet union and the united states threatened each other with thousands of nuclear tipped missiles on balance nuclear non proliferation has been a success story he said the world has made great progress mr blix said he continued to endorse disarmament through peaceful means i think it would be terrible if this comes to an end by armed force and i wish for this process of disarmament through the peaceful avenue of inspections he said but i also know that diplomacy needs to be backed by force sometimes and inspections need to be backed by pressure the decision to disarm iraq through force was not his he said restating what has become a veritable mantra it has to be decided by the security council and yes by iraq mr blix reiterated his report 's key finding that iraq had not provided anything like the wholehearted cooperation he needed to certify that saddam hussein was not concealing nuclear biological or chemical weapons his concern about iraq 's attitude he said led him to refrain from explicitly asking for more time for inspections when he reported to the security council on monday i have n't pleaded for continuing inspections because i have n't seen a change of attitude on the part of iraq he said in the interview mr blix said that his examination of a liquid filled warhead that inspectors had discovered in a bunker on jan 16 found no signs of any chemical weapons agent the other 11 warheads found in the bunker were empty he said adding that scores of samples his team had taken across iraq in the past two months had turned up no trace of either chemical or biological agents mr blix spent hours wednesday in a closed meeting being questioned about his report by members of the security council mr blix declined to discuss his session with the security council but diplomats said that the united states ambassador john d negroponte had pressed mr blix to make public the indications he referred to in his report that iraq had made weapons with thousands of liters of anthrax it produced in the early 1990 's mr blix is said to have demurred saying that the burden was on iraq to prove that it had destroyed any anthrax weapons he also assured mr negroponte that he would probably be able to determine by feb 14 whether two missiles iraq has declared it is developing exceed united nations range limits mr blix stated in his report that the missiles seemed to be a prima facie case of a violation by iraq of council resolutions in the interview mr blix reiterated his longstanding position that practical problems prevented him from using the authority he was given to interview iraqi scientists alone without iraqi government minders present at a neutral place inside iraq or outside the country we will at some point ask somebody if he is willing mr blix said noting that inspectors were already probing the possibility of such interviews in their discussions with scientists during inspections as for mr bush 's charges that iraqi intelligence agents were posing as scientists to be interviewed mr blix said he had seen scant evidence of it there were some occasions where people did n't seem very knowledgeable he said but if it has happened it 's not from the top and it 's certainly not anything that is common mr blix said that the intelligence information being provided by washington had improved of late but diplomats and american officials said that tensions lingered over american suspicions that iraq had infiltrated the united nations monitoring verification and inspections commission known as unmovic both sides agree that american satellites photographed what american analysts said were iraqi clean up crews operating at a suspected chemical weapons site they had identified within 48 hours after the information about the site was shared with unmovic but the diplomats say inspectors concluded that the site was an old ammunition storage area often frequented by iraqi trucks and that there was no reason to believe it was involved in weapons activities it was a wild goose chase one diplomat said but an administration official said there was good reason to believe the site was suspect and that unmovic had waited a week before visiting it whether something was removed or whether it was ever there remains an open question he complained he noted that although the cia was still providing inspectors with sensitive information concerns remained about unmovic 's ability to safeguard it iraqis may have bugged offices or hotel rooms of some unmovic people he said noting there were several examples in which iraqis seemed to have either advance knowledge or very good luck in going to places before inspectors
