christmas in black and white word the season 's most exuberantly ambitious album may well belong to nicole c mullen who was named female vocalist of the year by the gospel music association she sets out to provide something for everyone on her christmas album her limber girlish voice is at home in current rb style tunes like the devout lamb of god but she only begins there in the title song she narrates the annunciation story over a slow funk vamp that marvin gaye would appreciate and then there 's the salsa chorus in away in a sacred night the big band disco arrangement of 365 a jazzy brass band vamping behind god 's own son and a calypso bounce to carry sing angels sing ms mullen gives her whole family cameo appearances but even that indulgence comes across as part of the album 's generous spirit jon pareles
