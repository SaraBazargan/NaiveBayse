as spider man in sam raimi 's film which opens today review weekend page 1 the vegetarian tobey maguire may not fit a steak eater 's notion of a superhero but he seems to come close to what stan lee had in mind when he and the artist steve ditko rolled out that marvel comics action figure in 1962 on a couple of new dvd 's mr lee says he wanted the average person to identify with spider man a k a peter parker which meant giving him more feelings and saddling him with worries about girls family and friends i gave peter parker as many problems as i could mr lee says in spider man the ultimate villain showdown released this week on dvd and videocassette by buena vista he was n't a popular kid some of parker 's vulnerability rubs off on spider man who has an asthma attack fighting a villain and there was responsibility here was a superhero who used his powers not only to fight evil but also to swing off to get medicine for his ailing aunt may the most important thing is to do the right thing mr lee says you do n't have to be the greatest at anything that young kid with no special power who does right is more of a hero than a superhero if there was any message in the comic strip he adds that was it the ultimate villain showdown includes several episodes from the old animated television series with the web slinger in action against the green goblin the kingpin and others mr lee talks about his work and introduces each episode he says the animated cartoons are a little happier a little simpler than the comics on the disc mr lee says he has written a comic book version of the raimi movie on another dvd stan lee 's mutants monsters marvels to be released may 14 by columbia tristar also on videocassette he and the director kevin smith a comic book buff talk about the film and the comics mr lee says that when he conceived the character he wanted an original with a superhero you need a guy with a new power he says he saw a fly crawling on a wall fly man did n't work or mosquito man his boss at marvel did not like the idea of a spider either or that the superhero was a teenager that would not be credible or so it was thought now we know otherwise mr smith wonders why it took so long to put marvel comics science fiction figures like spider man and the characters in brian singer 's x men 2000 onto the big screen there being no ready answer to that they move on to mr lee 's contribution to the raimi film not only did he do a comic book version but he was also to make an appearance in a cameo in the scene which was cut mr lee is selling sunglasses in times square when disaster strikes and he runs in panic on reflection he says running did n't do justice to a stan lee hero so he asked to shoot the scene again this time he was to pick up a little girl and carry her to safety but he says the girl was too heavy and he took too long raimi said 'stan if we do it your way it will be a mini series mr lee says
