bob kear has been coaching john jay high school 's varsity boys lacrosse team here longer than most anyone can remember in fact he started the team as a club in 1976 it became an official school sport in 1979 at this time of year mr kear 49 is usually running drills and practices for his players but this season he will cheer from the sidelines in september mr kear was not reappointed lacrosse coach by the katonah lewisboro school board after complaints about him including allegations that he favored his sons over other team members mr kear remains a physical education teacher at the school citing privacy laws school officials have refused to comment on the specifics of the case but mr kear has been less reticent i 'm not going to take this lying down he said i 'm going to fight as long as it takes even if i never coach again he said the complaints centered around charges of not doling out playing time fairly and of favoritism toward his twin sons who are juniors last year casey and tucker kear were two of only three sophomores to start on the varsity team at season 's end both won all section awards from the section 1 lacrosse coaches association representing westchester putnam and rockland counties a sore point for some older players mr kear admitted he nominated his sons for the honors and prioritized their rankings ahead of their more senior teammates but he insisted he was playing fair tucker and casey outplayed other kids on the team he said i could have ducked or given them lowest priority and it would have probably saved my job but it would not have been right this all boils down to jealousy and animosity on the part of a few disgruntled parents mr kear 's dismissal led to blistering newspaper editorials and has divided members of the community bob did play favoritism toward his sons but i do n't think he should have been fired for it said patricia petrillo whose son garrett cutler plays goalie on the lacrosse team several parents said their concerns went beyond favoritism to mr kear 's attitude which they said they perceived as arrogant a document from the katonah lewisboro school board states that mr kear when told about parental complaints responded to board members they are your customers not mine a remark he does not deny some see what happened here as symptomatic of the growing parental involvement in children 's athletics especially at the high school level over the last 10 to 15 years we 've seen a sea change in how high school coaches are being second guessed by parents said rick wolff a psychologist from armonk who specializes in sports and child raising issues he said parents now feel they have invested so much time energy and money in their child 's athletics that the coach becomes the final linchpin in making or preventing their child from getting an athletic scholarship to college or even becoming a professional athlete parents today feel they have every right to force a confrontation with the coach or athletic department and take it all the way to the schools superintendent he said in katonah the schools superintendent dr robert lichtenfeld agrees that parents are no longer content to cheer quietly from the sidelines we have a much more demanding public said dr lichtenfeld who has been with the katonah lewisboro school system for 21 years in athletics we see it with parents reliving their egos through their kids there 's pressure to get kids into good colleges in athletics there 's even more pressure elsewhere in westchester county athletic departments are responding to issues of parental involvement at mamaroneck high school parents were given a set of guidelines this year to prevent parental coach conflicts among the issues deemed not appropriate for parents to discuss with coaches are playing time play calling and other student athletes i 've had parents complain to me about their kids playing time admitted gerry walsh head lacrosse coach at brewster high school but i think it 's important we teach our kids values i play my kids if they deserve to play but if one of my kids skips practice i 'm not going to start him even if he is my best player mr kear 's case is complicated by the involvement of his own children there 's a potential for all sorts of land mines when a coach decides to coach his or her own kid said mr wolff who has suggested that coaches take a sabbatical during the year or two that their children are playing unless the kid is clearly of superior talent anything a coach does may be construed as favoritism dr lichtenfeld agreed it 's very difficult for a coach to coach his own kids he said the higher the level of sport the harder it becomes but in this particular case the issues transcended that of coaching one 's own children mr kear who was paid 4200 as the lacrosse coach has filed a grievance through his teachers union which is supporting him in his effort to get his job back an arbitration hearing is set for the end of april at which point the lacrosse season will be well under way in the meantime mr kear 's former assistant nick savastano has been appointed head lacrosse coach mr kear said he expected to feel a twinge this season watching his sons play as just another parent instead of as head coach it 's going to be very hard for me not being in the coaching box he said it 's not my team but i built it i want to coach
