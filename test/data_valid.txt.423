cabaret music in america and that now includes a lot of what 's called world music these days caters to the specifications of its audience members who want to be momentarily tickled by high minded earthiness and then get on with their busy lives performers have to satisfy this particular position of urbanity precisely if they 're too messy bohemian or too broadly commercial they 've come to the wrong party lila downs a singer who lives in mexico city and who spent her youth in minneapolis and southern oaxaca gets the idea and her act there 's no other word for her mannered dramatic tableaux fuses traditional mexican music with jazz and folk and art with politics at makor on friday night she appeared in traditional mexican costume her dark braids threaded with yellow yarn with wide eyes a dancer 's erect posture and a battery of different voices she inhabited her songs which dealt with the anxiety and fear of young border crossers tired maquiladora workers dreaming of a way out of their lives mexicans driven by racism to envy whiteness lonely fishermen and the mythical figure of la llorana the crying woman ms downs 's voice is special as she shifted from a oaxacan song with an updated velvety arrangement to a mayan song from the yucatan peninsula her voice shifted from a masculine throaty region like betty carter 's low register to a piercing pinched shriek ms downs 's new album on narada records is called border for obvious reasons but this mayan song was one of the show 's moments where she approached another border the one between homage and condescension in channeling the noble soul of a simple folk musician from the state of quintana roo this was clearly her intellectual aim ms downs 's delivery grew so heavy handed that the performance verged on parody the set shifted among poems set to music old folk songs originals and north american songs sung in english including woody guthrie 's this land is your land and a bit incongruously the man i love by gershwin her five man band shifted instruments often bringing in harp saxophone keyboards clarinet fiddle congas and the wooden box called the cajon the arrangements of paul cohen who is also the co writer of ms downs 's songs were spacious and varied but occasionally ham fisted in the pursuit of sophistication when he played a short interlude of piano fourths in the middle of sale sobrando it felt like quick superficial appropriation of a genre it 's an enormously complicated equation ennobling latin american folkloric culture for a haute bourgeois audience one can so easily push it too far then again it has to be pushed a bit for the audience to grasp its political dimensions ms downs could gain by striking a compromise keeping the political energy of the songs but draining her performance of the overacting that stiffens it
