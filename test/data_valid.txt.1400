regional music has been under siege for a century battered by the homogenizing effects of broadcasting and recording yet through isolation entrepreneurship and stubborn good taste it survives in certain enclaves passing on its secrets to the musicians who value them galactic from new orleans and the north mississippi all stars from independence miss who shared a bill at irving plaza on saturday night are both dedicated to building a party with the lessons of the past galactic is steeped in the new orleans funk concocted by the meters and the neville brothers terse snappy tunes carried by rhythms that distill memories of mardi gras parades traditional jazz and rhythm and blues lean bass lines stuttering drumbeats chords placed coolly on the backbeat and melodies like bluesy epigrams add up to some of the most danceable music on earth the singer theryl de'clouet joined the group for a few songs in each set chasing love with a gutsy soul growl but galactic is primarily an instrumental band it 's not just a meters tribute because it warps the tunes in select directions ben ellman on tenor saxophone baritone saxophone or harmonica huffed out the melody lines like a precise one man horn section yet his solos could take off for the free jazz streaks and hoots of the world saxophone quartet stanton moore on drums sometimes triggered prerecorded drum patterns then placed staggered rhythms against them to create surreal layers of syncopation in most of its tunes galactic was a straightforward funk band sticking to song forms and riffing methodically to spur one member 's solo but it could also take off on freer neopsychedelic jams while keeping its core of new orleans rhythm when jeff raines on guitar sustained a high tremolo note rich vogel held a simmering hammond organ chord and mr stanton built a long crescendoing drum roll the dancing audience whooped and screamed like a trance music crowd the north mississippi all stars have mixed success in their down home update luther dickinson on guitar and cody dickinson on drums who are sons of the rock producer jim dickinson have taken up the scrappy clattery irregular sound of juke joint blues luther picks and slides the jumpy guitar riffs while cody kicks around the rhythms spattering them with nontraditional double time outbursts at one point he also played a washboard hooked up to a wah wah pedal blending the old time clatter with an electronic whoosh so far so good unfortunately neither luther dickinson nor chris chew on bass is a compelling blues singer too often the beat turned conventional and mr dickinson played slide guitar solos like a second rate allman brothers imitation perhaps the southern rock passages were a misguided concession to the jam band audience but they were a letdown after the unruly beauty of the juke joint blues
