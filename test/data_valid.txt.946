last week 's tough questioning of jeffrey skilling the former enron ceo may have been a blow for the truth but it also had the feeling of a dash for the finish line the winner was the house energy and commerce oversight subcommittee one of about a dozen senate and house committees and subcommittees simultaneously investigating the enron mess and the first to bag a major enron figure and display him under the klieg lights if investigators ever get to the bottom of enron 's financial skulduggery the arcane system of derivative transactions carried out through the company 's now infamous raptors partnerships they may want to get to work unraveling the logic defying system congress has put in place to conduct the enron probe so far we have heard andrew fastow the former enron chief financial officer plead the fifth amendment before the house energy and commerce oversight subcommittee and joseph berardino ceo of enron 's accounting firm arthur andersen defend his company 's actions before a house finance subcommittee not to be outdone by the lower chamber the senate has had its banking committee energy and natural resources committee finance committee health education labor and pensions committee and governmental affairs committee and the governmental affairs committee 's investigative subcommittee hauling in enron related witnesses the enron scandal is worthy of the highest level of scrutiny both because of the enormity of the crimes that may have been committed and because of what the largest bankruptcy in american history has already begun to reveal about the weaknesses in our nation 's corporate structures and regulatory oversight but this huge deployment of congressional committee members and staff the legislative equivalent of a ground war is clearly not the most surgical way of striking at enron 's misdeeds it would serve congress 's purposes better if the house and senate republican and democratic leadership met and imposed some order on the chaos if one or two designated committees took the lead as was done during the watergate investigation it would prevent the sort of information overload that occurred two weeks ago when jittery cable news networks were forced to cut between a panel of andersen employees being grilled about their enron work by one committee and arthur levitt jr the former securities and exchange commission chairman who was recommending reforms in the auditing industry before another more important if the major witnesses all appeared before the same congressional panelists it would be easier to weave their testimony about the complex goings on at enron into a coherent narrative when the time comes to institute specific reforms it will make sense for specialized committees and subcommittees to hold their own hearings to consider the appropriate changes in pensions corporate governance and governmental oversight but for now those specialists should step aside and let the larger story unfold in this television age it 's no great mystery why these hearings are proliferating there 's not an elected official in america who does n't want to be seen preferably on television and ideally during prime time holding forth on enron 's sins it 's hard for a politician to resist a setting where he can look sternly into the camera and say to a disgraced accountant as representative james greenwood did to the fired andersen partner david duncan enron robbed the bank arthur andersen provided the getaway car and they say you were at the wheel hamming it up for the voters at home is harmless enough but there also seems to be a more troubling driving force an almost mathematical correlation is emerging between how much money particular congressmen have accepted in campaign contributions from enron and andersen and how eager they are to be seen in prosecutorial mode the public owes a genuine debt of gratitude to the bipartisan inquisitorial team of representative billy tauzin the louisiana republican and senator joseph lieberman the connecticut democrat mr tauzin the house energy and commerce committee chairman known back home in cajun country as the swamp fox has gotten his teeth into andersen over the past few weeks and shows no sign of letting go but mr tauzin was also the house 's top beneficiary of andersen largesse 47000 in contributions since 1989 mr lieberman chairman of the senate governmental affairs committee has been a fixture on the television news circuit lately aiming his trademark gravelly voiced earnestness enron 's way but mr lieberman has received more than 100000 in contributions from citigroup one of enron 's leading creditors which has a large stake in how the enron mess sorts out mr lieberman was also embarrassed last month when word got out that his staff had met quietly last year with enron officials gatherings arranged by a onetime lieberman chief of staff who had gone on to become an enron lobbyist it 's tempting to say that enron and andersen deserve what they 're getting unleash all 535 senators and representatives on them at once and let the games begin but the current if it 's tuesday it must be the house energy and commerce committee approach is unwieldy and to the extent that it becomes a forum for congressmen to implicitly lobby voters to ignore past campaign contributions from enron it comes off as cynical it 's time for the congressional leadership to streamline the process after all if there 's one thing the enron debacle has already taught the nation it 's the chaos that can result from underregulation
