the war of the words has already started in the senate which for the first time remains evenly split among democrats and republicans normally the party in control elects one senator to the post but because the chamber is evenly divided the republican senate president john bennett asserted in a press release last week no one can claim the title instead mr bennett announced two co caucus leaders robert singer and anthony bucco in contrast to the democrat caucus led by democrat leader dick codey we did not elect a member to the title of senate majority leader simply because neither side has a majority mr bennett said in a news release he asked that senator codey and his caucus reconsider the use of the title majority leader mr codey quickly responded with his own news release which effectively told mr bennett to get a life senator bennett apparently had a fight in his caucus over the senate republican majority leader position so they settled for two number two 's and called them co caucus leaders he said if that works for them fine mr codey then added with all due respect senator bennett should tend to his own caucus and i 'll tend to mine barbara fitzgerald
