to the editor fay vincent standing up for umpires op ed aug 8 is right i would add only that there 's a culture of mistreating umpires that needs to change and i believe that it should start at the grass roots level with the fans it has been a baseball tradition to boo the umpire when he rules against the home team but i feel that there 's no longer self restraint on the part of fans abusive language and even objects are hurled at umpires in all the major league parks i visit as a current college player i can tell you it is easy for players to overreact if they hear the fans egging them on next time an umpire makes a close call and you know that it 's right why not applaud and while you 're at it boo a player who wrongfully argues with an umpire faiz shakir palm bay fla aug 8 2001
