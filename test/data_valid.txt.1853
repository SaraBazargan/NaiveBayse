the crowd at three rivers stadium groaned but mike hampton was not about to apologize for a called strike too often for his liking this season the mets left hander has not gotten close ball strike calls much of that has been hampton 's fault if he had not been so wild he would probably have gotten the benefit of the umpires doubt but it was a different hampton who beat the pittsburgh pirates tonight in a 2 0 victory constructed on home runs by edgardo alfonzo and derek bell and secured by armando benitez who earned his first save after four disastrous outings in non save situations this was the hampton the mets installed as their no 1 starter after acquiring him in a december trade with houston he worked eight and one third innings allowing six hits walking only one he seemed to have earned the right to get a borderline call hampton who leads the majors in walks permitted only one runner on a single through four innings but he opened the fifth by allowing a single and a double putting runners at second and third and he fell behind pat meares 2 and 1 hampton prides himself on refusing to give in to hitters and he tried a slider on the next pitch it just nicked the outside corner for a strike and though most of the 14015 fans disputed it evened the count 2 and 2 hampton jammed meares with a fastball on the next pitch which meares swung through for the strikeout when you 're always falling behind and walking guys you 're not going to get away with anything catcher mike piazza said tonight he was able to command both sides of the plate effectively the meares strikeout brought up the pirates eighth and ninth hitters and seemed to inspire hampton on a grounder to third he spun off kevin young while applying the tag in a rundown then took a grounder off his wrist to end the inning bouncing his throw to first because he had lost feeling in his hand his bruise was unsightly the stitch marks from the ball were visible manager bobby valentine said but the numbness wore off quickly and hampton was in charge the rest of the way in each of the next three innings a runner reached first with two out each time hampton ended the inning one batter later hampton had the best ground ball to fly ball ratio in the national league last year when he went 22 4 but as he struggled to a 2 4 record and 652 earned run average before tonight 's start he sometimes had trouble getting grounders his trademark sinker was on tonight mets right fielder bell said it was falling off the table and all of hampton 's final 21 outs came from grounders or strike outs hampton had insisted that his problems were not mechanical but he said tonight that he had sped up his delivery the biggest difference he said was mental a weekend tutorial with the mets broadcaster and hall of famer tom seaver had a positive impact talking to tom seaver in between starts some of the greatest pitchers in the world have had this hampton said you 've just got to focus and relax that 's the biggest thing there 's ups and downs and for me that was a big down period but you 've got to shorten those up go out there and do your job and make pitches hampton was pitching under pressure all game long the mets gave him only two runs and they came on consecutive pitches in the third inning kirk benson the pirates right hander allowed an opposite field home run to right by bell and alfonzo followed with a homer to center but the mets offense slumbered after that and the pirates had the potential winning run at the plate with one out in the ninth after hampton allowed a single and hit batsmen on what valentine said were the only two pitches he left above the belt all night benitez 's era average had swelled to near 700 over his past four outings in which he allowed nine earned runs in three and two thirds innings john franco had gotten the call in the mets last save situation and franco warmed up tonight but benitez was summoned and he used an improved slider to help earn his ninth save getting meares to fly out and pinch hitter john vander wal to strike out looking it 's a good step said benitez who worked on slowing his delivery i have to continue like this so does hampton and so do the mets who had lost nine of 12 before the game no 1 starters are supposed to stop losing streaks and hampton stopped his first one tonight inside pitch outfielder darryl hamilton underwent surgery on his left big toe tuesday and general manager steve phillips said it would be six to eight weeks before he could start playing again if hamilton needs a rehab assignment it would be even longer before he could return to the mets hamilton is three weeks from being able to run again the right hander bobby j jones will make his second rehab start for class aaa norfolk on friday at buffalo jones who has missed about a month with a strained right calf said he has been told he would return to the mets after the second rehab start manager bobby valentine had lunch tuesday with texas gov george w bush who was the owner of the texas rangers when valentine managed the team
