as a deadline to save their jobs came and went this afternoon scores of striking nurses picketed in front of nyack hospital in a defiant display of their resolve in a months long contract dispute the nurses had a deadline of 5 pm today to notify the hospital of their intention to return to work monday morning or risk being permanently replaced hospital officials said they would wait until monday to reveal how many nurses had called about coming back but union leaders said a source inside the hospital had told them it was only a handful under a gray blanket of clouds the nurses marched many accompanied by young children and supporters as the protesters counted down the seconds to 5 o'clock a union leader burned letters the hospital had sent the nurses about the deadline one union official at the rally estimated that 250 nurses were present officials of the new york state nurses association the union representing 33000 nurses statewide said the deadline 's timing was odd given that a negotiating session was scheduled for monday but nancy kriz a spokeswoman for the 375 bed hospital in rockland county said the contract still needed to be resolved an intent to permanently replace does n't end the strike she said in the four months since the strike began there has been no progress in negotiations hospital administrators and union officials do not even agree on what the pertinent issues are with union negotiators concerned about staffing levels and hospital officials focused on merit pay after declaring negotiations at an impasse in december the hospital implemented the terms of its final contract offer a move upheld this month by the national labor relations board those terms included a new wage system based on merit and a reconfiguring of sick time last weekend letters went out to the 425 striking nurses about the decision to begin hiring permanent replacements in the letter the hospital said that a nurse who was replaced could get the job back only after the replacement nurse left because of retirement or resignation during the strike many nurses found interim employment at other hospitals while nyack hospital turned to a colorado company for temporary nurses about 25 nurses chose not to strike some of the picketers said they doubted the hospital would find many replacements in the current nursing shortage union officials oppose the changes the hospital put in place but their strongest objection is to the hospital 's refusal to guarantee nurse to patient ratios inadequate staffing they said has led to forced overtime and has hurt patient care one picketer wore a placard that read 16 patients 1 rn disaster you have nurses who have 20 years of seniority said anne schott a union spokeswoman who have put this all on the line there were only 44 mandatory overtime shifts out of 85000 shifts in 1999 ms kriz said but union leaders said that number reflected instances when an individual nurse was ordered to work extra hours more often union negotiators said a supervisor tells a group of nurses that someone must stay longer the nurses then decide who is in a position to work overtime in reviews of the hospital 's operations in recent years neither the joint commission on accreditation of health care organizations nor the new york state department of health has singled out staffing levels as a concern ms kriz said greger c andersen the hospital 's president and chief executive said the union 's focus on staffing was a tactic to distract from the real issues of merit pay and sick time the infrequent cases of mandatory overtime resulted from the misuse of sick time he said
