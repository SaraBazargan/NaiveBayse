towering over the yankees spring training base casting a super bowl shadow of civic superiority from across dale mabry highway is raymond james stadium home of the tampa bay buccaneers the only kind of team george steinbrenner can bring himself to respect champions in the most current sense unlike steinbrenner 's yankees who went tamely in the first round of the playoffs last fall who have brought shame to legends field in steinbrenner 's hometown by failing to win the world series for two years and counting whatever magic joe torre was working when he won four titles in five years has in steinbrenner 's mind obviously worn off the intangibles that made derek jeter the modern mr october have been misplaced steinbrenner apparently believes at a trendy new york night spot so much for the owner 's seven year homage to stability subtlety and all other wimpy baseball conventions with the dynasty in the balance steinbrenner has put torre and his coaching staff on notice that he wants to see a little less grace and a lot more gruden jeter the highest paid yankee and renowned money player has been told to dig a trench at shortstop and not to come out even for dinner he takes the belt off reggie jackson said yesterday he says 'all right you 're going to play better and if you do n't you 're going to get some of this steinbrenner has decided to motivate the troops the way he used to the way he was taught by his father through outright fear consider his recent comments on the work ethic of torre 's coaching staff and on jeter 's lifestyle they are the confessions of a dangerous football mind on the subject of his expensive baseball team that 's always been the mentality of steinbrenner the sideline screamer who has treated every failure as a betrayal of effort year after world series year he watched torre calmly make all the right moves and jeter execute all the big plays and you just knew it was a complete mystery to steinbrenner how it all managed to work out without the use of his belt even when we win there 's a lot of that driving people torre said yesterday asked if the so called strategy might actually work on jeter torre said if he has a better year that 'll be what 's written that he had a better year because of it i do n't buy it one reads between torre 's lines to gauge his frustration but jeter 's comments to the associated press this week stripped away the cool veneer of a player who has worked hard on his clean public image and was insulted to suddenly have to be defensive about it what he said has been turned into me being this big party animal jeter said i 'm like dennis rodman now of course he is exaggerating because he is 28 and has had a storybook career but jeter now knows what the old timers around camp could tell him every yankee star who takes the biggest paycheck from steinbrenner eventually becomes the target for what goes wrong if he asked me how he should handle it i would say 'do n't change anything said willie randolph the third base coach who over the years has watched reggie and winfield and mattingly deal with the noise from upstairs it is true that jeter 's numbers last year were below his norm but how exactly might he have altered the outcome of the season with 30 more points on his batting average when the yankees ran away with the division and he hit 500 against the angels in the playoffs as long as the yankees were producing network stages for steinbrenner to cry on while accepting world series trophies he could let people think he had mellowed with age while he went about the business of leveraging the championships into a cable network and total control of his product he is close now in the red zone with only charles dolan keeping him from revenue streams that will maximize his profits with plenty more left over to outspend the field he collected starting pitchers this winter the way division i schools stockpile scholarship players to further the football metaphor this winter steinbrenner dropped all pretense of payroll constraint trying to buy back whatever edge the yankees have lost to keep the cable network on the rise and dolan on the run it conditions us for the season said torre in summary of steinbrenner 's opening remarks knowing that if the yankees do n't win it all it 'll likely be his last
