that fashion is so often equated with change has always seemed a funny notion given how much it remains always and forever the same since the dawn of cloth for instance runway shows have followed an unaltered course they begin with comparatively simple pieces meant to telegraph the designer 's particular conceit dorothy hamill meets dorothy day and end with the most fantastic and costly iterations of the idea in play by the time the mango dyed sheared sable ball skirts come down the runway the message of each and every fashion show is clear the more you acquire the greater the chances the world will treat you as if you rule over your own empire it took alexander mcqueen to come along muck up the script and subvert the narrative which he managed with the kind of intensity rarely experienced in fashion anymore the notes passed out in advance of mr mcqueen 's show on friday night did not immediately suggest what a promising affair one was about to behold the very first sentence mentioned the director sydney pollack a man easier to imagine as a nice orthodontist than as a fashion muse as it turned out mr mcqueen was informing the audience that he had turned to mr pollack 's 1969 film they shoot horses do n't they as his reference of all the dispiriting movies hollywood produced about the delusions of capitalism during the late 60 's and early 70 's that one is arguably the bleakest depression era couples compete in a barbaric dance marathon in exchange for food and the sketchy promise of prize money it is hard to remember the last time a designer tried his hand at grim social commentary and accomplished anything more than showing a lot of black clothes with harnesses and duct tape accompanied by a soundtrack of bad atonal music recorded in berlin mr mcqueen aiming at something both more explicit and more subtle built his show around the idea of a dance contest in which hope and happiness quickly evaporate he showed the pieces that traditionally make up the finale first on models coupled with dance partners here came a gown with gentle bell sleeves made completely of silver sequins and a full skirt constructed from marabou feathers set in the round the next sequence cleverly introduced handkerchief dresses inspired by basketball jerseys and other vaguely athletic looks with the models racing around the floor in circles the show ended with the losers strung out immobile or dead wearing clothes rendered in patchwork or miserably exquisitely torn up it is rare for any single fashion week to produce one such flash of originality remarkably this one produced two the viktor rolf show also held friday provided what might qualify as an actual new garment viktor horsting and rolf snoeren the dutch design team whose work is the subject of a retrospective at the union centrale des arts decoratifs here turned out a series of tulle and chiffon gowns with skirts that wrapped three quarters of the way around the body exposing trousers ingeniously built in in a sense the show served as a rebuke to all the mindlessly literal ways in which designers have aimed for the androgynous sexuality of yves saint laurent invoking many of his conceptual tropes the designers played creatively with tuxedos for example lopping off the tops to give the jackets the appearance of falling off but preserving them on the body with straps like those on a bra they did the same with white men 's shirts and they clipped off the sleeves on trench coats blouses were tied at the collar at a deranged looking angle phoebe philo 's show for chloe on saturday afternoon indicated that this designer does n't want to test her talents too much the show opened with unusually high waisted bell bottom jeans the kind available in any college town thrift shop for 14 that will invariably cost 30 times that amount in a chloe boutique the same went for high waisted denim gaucho pants as did high heeled sandals worn with lacoste tube socks indeed the whole thrill of chloe seems to rest in the faintly masochistic idea of paying a great sum of money for clothes the baby sitter was wearing around 1975 that said there were a number of pretty looks that seemed worth the price of admission chief among them a chevron patterned leather duster inlaid with panels of green beading ms philo 's predecessor at chloe stella mccartney who now has her own line needs to take a trip move to sweden study accounting at wharton anything to help her figure out that very few women wish to live in wispy vaguely grecian inspired little dresses she shows those sorts of dresses repeatedly and she devoted nearly her entire show to them sunday morning many were offered in colors like acid green suitable for precious few in the human species julien macdonald 's continuing presence at givenchy has perplexed many in fashion since the clothes he turns out for the venerated french couture house have so little in common with what it once represented on saturday afternoon mr macdonald presented a collection reminiscent of his first ready to wear line for the label two years ago all the clothes in gauze and laden with rope seemed intended for the sort of holiday one might have taken in mykonos decades ago this time out mr macdonald added music from the carpenters the carpenters would have been welcome at ann demeulemeester 's show on friday night another go and get your prozac escapade from this designer a visit to the territory of lank hair black cargo pants and miniskirts dangling with too many hanging straps and an excess of ill temper the world is no party at the moment but the cheerful still live among us
