at a butlers convention in denver last year paul burrell the former butler to diana princess of wales won a standing ovation more than 150 butlers most of them americans who serve americans were moved by their british colleague 's steadfast loyalty to his late employer mr burrell whom diana had called her rock had not yet blabbed about the princess or any members of the royal family he had remained silent despite hurtful and as it turned out false accusations that he had stolen diana 's belongings after her death at the convention where he delivered the keynote speech mr burrell preached passionately of the button lipped traditions that he then practiced she knew she was safe with me and she still is he said to thunderous applause from his personal service peers the royal butler of course has since talked his head off he has retailed dirty royal linen to a british tabloid pushed the house of windsor into another squalidly delicious scandal and transformed himself into a rich and nearly famous man he has secured his own television game show what the butler saw an hourlong television interview diana 's rock the paul burrell story has been peddled to abc as well as to networks in eight other countries what then of the button lipped traditions of personal service as british royals hire lawyers and run for cover should wealthy americans with servants fret that their secrets might go on public display if there is money in it for the nanny maid or butler the answer seems to be yes especially when employers are cheap creepy or cruel there is a time for comeuppance if they are going to take advantage of you and are nasty said fraser brown a british born butler who works for a family in connecticut if i were at retirement age and did n't have any money saved up then blabbing might be a consideration mr brown said it depends on what the story is worth mr brown hastened to add that his current employer whom he declined to name is treating him very well indeed the downstairs propensity to dish for dollars is roughly proportional to the upstairs supply of degrading meanness according to keith greenhouse who specializes in finding jobs for butlers and chauffeurs in new york i 'm not saying it is right but it is human nature said mr greenhouse president of the pavillion agency in manhattan when servants are treated well there is nothing they would n't do for their employer or their former employer but when they are not he said temptation is definitely great they say 'i gave them so many years of good service and i got nothing but abuse in return so why not blab mr greenhouse advises all clients even those who are not especially rich famous or badly behaved to insist that every member of their household staff sign ironclad confidentiality agreements fewer than half of his clients take this advice he said in new york as elsewhere when an employer is unpleasant to work for word quickly gets around one prickly billionaire in manhattan is known to have a particularly difficult time hiring and keeping qualified staff like many rich people with staffing problems this billionaire insists on confidentiality agreements in mr burrell 's case the apparent trigger for a lucrative tell all was the torturing silence of queen elizabeth she kept quiet for nearly two years as mr burrell was investigated humiliated and put on trial for stealing diana 's possessions after her death in a car crash in september 1997 the queen waited 12 days into the trial which started last month until the point where mr burrell was scheduled to testify and possibly embarrass the royal family before suddenly remembering that no crime could have been committed long before robbery charges were filed the queen acknowledged mr burrell had informed her in person that he was holding onto some of diana 's belongings for safekeeping the times of london reported last week that mr burrell 's lawyers had sought the queen 's intervention three times in 2001 had she spoken sooner the loyal butler might still be loyal he might not have given the police a 39 page deposition full of revelations about the royal family such as prince charles 's insistence that his valet hold a specimen bottle while he urinated into it not long after what was meant to be a secret court document was leaked to the press and not by the butler mr burrell unbuttoned his lip sold his story to the daily mirror for a reported 480000 and became a globe trotting for profit television tattler like all royal servants mr burrell signed a confidentiality agreement prince charles 's lawyers however have apparently determined that trying to enforce it with the cat already out of the bag would only draw more attention to what the butler said according to british press reports being hung out to dry by the royal family while certainly unpleasant is still no excuse for betraying the ethics of personal service said mary louise starkey the founder of the starkey international institute for household management the school based in denver markets itself as the harvard of high end household help it was mrs starkey who invited mr burrell to give the keynote speech at the butler convention she organized that invitation she hastened to add was offered at a time when mr burrell was still honoring the standards of his profession she said she would not invite him now if we are to be a respected profession a code of ethics must apply no matter how the relationship between a butler and the family has deteriorated mrs starkey said her school teaches novice butlers everything such as how to space plates at the dinner table and when to clip their nose hair mrs starkey said there is no gray area when it comes to disclosing the secrets of one 's employers even if they are abusive creeps even if they are dead once you have been given access to someone 's private life you can not capitalize on what you know she said there is she said one ethical escape route we teach them to say 'if you continue to treat me in this shabby manner i unfortunately am no longer able to serve you mrs starkey said noting that one of the most important skills of a service professional is knowing how and when to quit outside butler school however relationships between master and servant tend to be much muddier jeff jones a longtime butler in manhattan said that in the real world of household help loyalty is always a two way street just because they have money does n't give them the right to treat the staff like dogs he said the queen was in a position to stop this nonsense up front when she did n't speak out burrell was released from his ethical responsibilities mr jones hastened to add that his employer whom he declined to name treats him very well indeed
