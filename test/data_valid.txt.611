back in the days before i knew botanical latin i thought of a geranium as a popular annual with splashy pink white or red flowers now that i have mastered the nomenclature i know that so called geraniums are actually pelargoniums and that true geraniums botanically speaking are underused garden treasures treasures because they are beautiful require exceptionally low maintenance and are generally avoided by rabbits and deer and because they are perennial in my central new jersey borders and most of the united states as well they need not be replanted every year until recently i could n't understand why true or hardy geraniums as they are known are so seldom used in gardens i have since learned that many true geraniums adored by gardeners in europe are often unhappy in hot humid situations hallmarks of summers in the mid atlantic and southeast because of this true geraniums gained reputations as temperamental hard to grow plants while the easy going pelargoniums won the hearts of americans twenty years ago unaware of their reputation i bought some bigroot geraniums g macrorrhizum adding them to a dry shady spot in one of my borders as it turned out i chose an easy plant that has thrived ever since bearing magenta pink flowers for two to three weeks each may its rich green foliage forms a dense mat up to two feet wide and often features red and yellow tones in fall i next acquired ingwersen 's variety named for a distinguished british horticulturist this bigroot cultivar has soft pink flowers that bloom for up to five weeks starting in early may as if compensating for the extra energy put into flower production the leaves spread at a much slower rate than those on the species plant i next added the spessart bigroot cultivar to my border this bears blush white flowers veined in pink for almost two months and it too appears to have a slower spread than the species plant to fill in a mostly sunny area i bought lancaster geraniums g sanguineum var striatum their soft pink flowers lightly veined in a darker pink bloom from late may to hard frost these flowers seem to float above the low growing mat of dark green foliage in november i will often see a last pink blossom or two among leaves acquiring bright red tones a friend meanwhile gave me g cinereum lawrence flatman its rosy pink flowers have a dark magenta eye and are etched with the same color while i have read that this has a bloom period of up to two months it is more like three weeks in the shady spot where i have placed it the dark green ground hugging leaves are handsome paired with the silver splashed foliage of lamium cultivars though i felt i was fairly sophisticated when it came to true geraniums i changed my mind two months ago when i met gabriel welsch a poet and lecturer at pennsylvania state university in state college pa his garden is so spectacular that it is featured on garden conservancy tours and his partly shaded borders are filled with hardy geraniums his favorite is g biokova karmina with fuchsia blossoms early spring through early summer and leaves mottled with red and dark green he also mentioned g renardii heidi morris with lilac blue flowers and lovely glaucous foliage and g himalayense with almost gentian blue flowers intrigued i got in touched with two noted plant people dan heims the president of terra nova nurseries in portland ore and bruce blevins the director of glasshouse production and propagation at the new york botanical garden mr heims explained that recent interest in true geraniums has been fueled by the introduction of varieties from japan that easily handle heat and humidity his company 's web site wwwterranovanurseriescom has pictures and information on retail sources confetti a g yoshinoi cultivar is one of his favorites it has variegated foliage that also exhibits pink tones during cool springs the pink flowers bloom for many weeks mr blevins recommends g brookside with large long blooming white eyed blue flowers and colorful fall foliage g pratense victor reiter jr with royal purple spring leaves which age to a purple edged dark green and large dark lilac flowers and rozanne a june to frost bloomer with blue to lavender flowers then there is g rubescens currently on display in the ladies border at the botanical garden it has exquisite red trimmed foliage and a summer flush of long purplish pink flowers true geraniums are wonderful under flowering crab trees or dogwoods mr blevins said it 's also nice to elevate them letting them spill down a slope or over a retaining wall for the most part they like good air and soil drainage and morning sun or semi shade many are great in containers or even hanging baskets
