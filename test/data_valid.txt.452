on the first friday after that sudden tuesday i took an afternoon train back homeward out of manhattan and into the country do you remember the day the clouds were pulling apart in the distance exposing blue sky along the western horizon the streets of harlem took the light and held it their brick buildings seeming almost to swell with solidity in the substance of those streets and the surface of the river and the embrace of the railroad bridge into the bronx there was a profound material comfort material is the important word the world into which i was passing exuded nothing but its own repose it had no news to deliver or rather only the old inarticulate news that bricks and water and steel have always delivered after a while i reached my stop and drove north along a highway through the cornfields here too i felt the same thing that there was a mute voice in the extreme order of those rows of corn in the rasp of their drying leaves against each other the round bales in the hayfields looked like a gathering point for shadows the trees slipped by dispassionately it 's often possible to look at a rural landscape and feel that you 're being drawn into it that what you see in the distance somehow tugs you outward along the line of sight but this was just the opposite the countryside seemed to pour itself down into the windows of the pickup the empty corncribs the neat stacks of firewood the mellifluous pastures on the highest hillsides at home the horses and dogs consoled me in a way i could n't understand until i finally realized that they could not be told what had happened that week in that fact lay the consolation they had only the old news to give their old satisfaction with the world as they know it life is bearing witness in some superficial sense the morning of sept 11 sifted us all into different circles of witnessing some people narrowly escaped the collapsing towers others watched in terrified safety from windows and rooftops farther uptown many like me saw it live on television from midtown while an incalculable number of people around the country and the world watched as the tapes were replayed into the night and the coming days but we 're all witnesses no matter what we saw or how we saw it our burden is of course very different from the burden the victims bore and their families still bear but it is no less real witnessing is a matter of knowledge and of conscience we know what we saw and yet we watch the televised tapes play over and over again because we disbelieve what we know we also watch because it feels as if we 're attesting to history denouncing a crime renewing a commitment and also because to break off watching feels like a betrayal it 's hard to know just yet whether for each of us this witnessing has caused an erosion or a sedimentation a stripping away of the skin or a callusing but paradoxical as it may sound to continue to bear witness in conscience to these terrorist crimes it may be necessary to stop watching them for a while to turn off the television to break what in many people has become a self reinforcing circle of despair there is no abiding consolation at the moment but the clouds do sometimes pull apart if only temporarily the day after i got home i stopped by a small lumber mill to pick up some siding that the owner had cut for a chicken house i 'm building it was the sort of day we 've been having plenty of luminous and deep the owner waved from behind a metal grinder that was throwing off sparks and pointed me toward the mill on its wooden rails lay my lumber smooth fragrant planks of pine scalloped and grooved to fit together the way so few things seemed to be doing elsewhere i ran my hand down their lengths felt the light flouring of sawdust on each board and for the moment thought of nothing else
