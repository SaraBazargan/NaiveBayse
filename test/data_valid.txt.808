there will be football played at columbia on saturday and the weekend ca n't get here soon enough for the players and the coaches alike the lions will play bucknell starting their season a week late after their game with fordham was postponed last weekend if there had been a game i think that my guys would have been prepared columbia coach ray tellier said but i think it was a good idea not to play in the wake of the terrorist attacks last week the athletic departments of columbia and fordham decided that their game would take place despite the growing national sentiment that games should not be played that decision was reversed on friday however no decision has yet been made on a makeup date although one possibility is thanksgiving weekend i slept at the office last tuesday and we had a late practice on wednesday so i really did n't get to see the full magnitude of what had happened until thursday said tellier who lives in new jersey and feared he could not get back to work on wednesday if he went home i think some of the players wanted to play but maybe a lot of them were not sure if it was the right thing to do but they understood fully and some of them were probably relieved tellier had told his coaching staff to prepare as if there would be a game but he also told them he doubted that the lions would play on thursday the nfl and all of the major college football conferences called off last weekend 's games but still no decision had been made about the lions game with fordham then on friday a conversation between the presidents of the two universities resulted in the postponement it was a really frustrating week as far as football goes columbia 's senior tailback johnathan reese said i never really believed that we would play and i was surprised it was still on the roster but as we got closer and closer to saturday and still no decision had been made i thought that we might just go through with it then we find out the day before that it would be canceled it was tough but i understand the decision i just think there was a lot of focus on us because we were one of the last ones to pull the plug this week 's game will not be easy for columbia bucknell which has run off six consecutive winning seasons would present problems to columbia under normal circumstances bucknell already has a game under its belt a 38 17 loss at kent state on sept 8 and has one of the patriot league 's most dangerous players in the senior running back jabu powell they do n't try to trick you tellier said they are very physical and they do n't beat themselves by making mistakes after practicing for four weeks without a game the lions are eager to get on the field it 's like we 've been in camp for a month and a half and that 's a ridiculously long time reese said but now i think we can focus our energies into something we really want to do which is playing quarterback jeff mccall said football is the one thing that we can lean upon and know we can go out with our friends and enjoy ourselves with our friends for a couple of hours last week was a hard one but i think we 'll be ready to play saturday
