the chicago bears finally tired last season of the tampa bay buccaneers smacking them around r w mcquarters a bears cornerback remembers when his team ended the bucs six game winning streak in this rugged series we beat them here last year 13 10 and warren sapp said 'i ca n't believe we let the chicago bears beat us how could that happen those guys are the doormat of our division mcquarters recalled today he paused and added i imagine right now they are shocked they are probably wondering what happened to the doormats i 'm not saying that 's what they are now but it sure does n't describe us anymore no try playoff team that 's the bears they ripped tampa bay 27 3 at soldier field in a game that chicago dominated as much as it sounds from the score the bears ran around over and through tampa bay for 207 yards and added two jim miller touchdown passes in improving to 10 3 and completing a sweep of the bucs this season add it up and that is three straight chicago victories over tampa bay as the bears earned their first playoff berth since the 1994 season and it is their first 10 victory season since 1991 this is a team that crashed to records of 7 9 4 12 4 12 6 10 and 5 11 in the last five seasons a franchise that has seen its share of turmoil in recent years in ownership management coaching quarterback and stadium issues a team that others especially those in the national football conference central kicked around for nearly the last decade one they used to trample on the way to greater things now the bears enjoy that role while tampa bay 7 6 struggles to reach the playoffs the bucs do not have to worry about the bears completely flipping the script though because next season as part of realignment tampa bay moves out of the nfc central so for the bears this was one nasty parting shot and the bucs felt the sting they took it to us in every way bucs coach tony dungy said they played with a lot of energy we played with energy but not well enough to keep going with them to lose a game of this magnitude a game that meant so much by this score is disappointing bucs safety john lynch said the second half they just ran it down our throats that 's the ultimate insult there 's no worse feeling as a defense to have that happen it 's the easiest thing in the world to turn around and hand the ball off and that 's what they were able to do and receiver keyshawn johnson said the bears they 're going places a chicago field goal accounted for the only points in the first quarter but tampa bay tied the game with 7 minutes 54 seconds left before halftime then the bears answered with a 62 yard pass from miller to receiver david terrell that wound up at the tampa bay 2 the bears looked smart throwing the deep ball early loosening the passing game to later loosen the running lanes terrell 's long grab set up miller 's 2 yard scoring lob into the left corner of the end zone to receiver marty booker booker was ruled out of bounds but the bears challenged the call when referee bob mcelwee returned to the field and dramatically raised his arms signaling touchdown the crowd of 66944 rocked the stage was set domination would follow we lost a big game to green bay last week and maybe people thought the wheels would fall off bears linebacker warrick holdman said right now i 'm just open like a little kid this is great stuff holdman helped make sure the wheels did not fall off with tampa bay at the chicago 27 with 58 seconds left before halftime holdman tackled quarterback brad johnson stripping the ball away chicago got it and drove 25 yards in 54 seconds and paul edinger kicked a 46 yard field goal as time expired for a 13 3 lead that gave us a lot of momentum for the second half said bears linebacker brian urlacher who made eight tackles and defended two passes we have n't lost two in a row all season that says a lot about the character of this team in the second half bears tight end fred baxter made a leaping twisting catch of 18 yards against two defenders for a touchdown running back anthony thomas got 146 of his 173 rushing yards in the second half and scored on a 5 yard run the rout was complete miller completed 14 of 29 passes for 190 yards brad johnson struggled connecting on only 18 of 40 passes for 191 yards and 2 interceptions warrick dunn 10 carries 27 yards mike alstott 7 carries 23 yards and the entire tampa bay offense struggled even when keyshawn johnson made a 47 yard grab midway through the second quarter and was sprinting toward the end zone that potential lift for tampa bay turned sour too cornerback walt harris forced a fumble from behind near the chicago 1 and bears safety tony parrish returned it to the chicago 22 chicago created its own luck as it has all season it forced four turnovers won the rushing game 207 yards to 61 and ran the ball 40 times while throwing it 29 times great balance great production we have n't been good in this league for a long time and winning does wonderful things for your team and for the city miller said you can hear and feel the buzz and sense it from coach dick jauron and all the bears this is a wonderful group of guys they work jauron said they deserve the playoffs they 've worked to get in and they 've earned their way in we 've got a lot of work in front of us obviously but it 's a great feeling in that locker room
