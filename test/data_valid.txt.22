to the editor having lived the first 40 years of my life in new york city and on long island i consider myself a total new yorker despite currently living outside seattle and like so many of my fellow new yorkers i think of sept 11 as the date of the attack on the world trade center but then i catch myself sept 11 was the date of the attack on america and we lost precious lives outside new york city at the pentagon and in pennsylvania the redevelopment plans front page july 17 are all beautiful and painfully not our beloved towers but they can be even more beautiful by being a fitting memorial for all those lost that terrible day wherever they perished honor them all we are all brethren whatever city town or country we call home jeanne mendez sammamish wash july 17 2002
