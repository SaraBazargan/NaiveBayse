bobby valentine is not a proponent of clubhouse speeches so he does not remember specifically the last time he gave one he thinks it was during the last days of spring training or after the mets returned from japan but he is not sure valentine does remember one of the things he said during that speech he warned the mets that there are going to be distractions this season this is new york something always happens be ready that was valentine 's stern advice but anyone who needed to be told that needs smelling salts too the manager should have also reminded the mets that he can be a walking talking distraction valentine can not avoid distractions some that he causes and some that get pinned on him because he is as popular as a dentist who eschews novocain still the mets must heed valentine 's words and try to ignore any controversies that emanate from the manager 's office the front office anywhere the test of a team valentine said is how it deals with winning and losing and distractions so far the mets have tested well even though it is surely coincidental that they have snatched seven of the last eight games since valentine 's comments at penn 's wharton school of business were reported nine days ago the mets swept the cubs 8 3 and 7 6 yesterday behind a surprising glendon rusch and a surprising dennis springer things are going amazingly well for the mets when they can use two starters with a combined career record of 35 71 and win both games i was really proud the way the two unknowns came through for us valentine said valentine helped spice up the gray day before it even started by bringing the lineup card to the plate for the first time in 535 games as the mets manager something the cubs don baylor had challenged him to do while valentine said his players persuaded him he obviously enjoyed stirring the feud that started when baylor forgot to include jeff huson on the lineup card in the season opener in japan and the mets protested the encounter before the first game of the doubleheader started curiously as valentine and baylor separately shook hands with the umpires and not each other the umpires explained the ground rules and then valentine said something to baylor baylor took two steps toward valentine and the managers had an animated chat before parting i just wanted to make sure there was n't a problem valentine said he indicated there was no problem we indicated that it 's over baylor huffed whatever about the exchange as reporters left his office valentine playfully said where would you guys be without me the wharton incident sure seems a lot older than nine days valentine made supposedly divisive remarks about the mets a graduate student interpreted them and popped them on the mets web site and general manager steve phillips wanted to clarify valentine 's explanation and bolted to meet the manager in pittsburgh phillips 's itinerary which was approved by fred wilpon the president was hasty and looked even more careless once the student apologized for botching valentine 's words but as the saga erupted unfolded and subsided the mets remained largely unaffected maybe they did not need a lecture to tell them that whatever happens with valentine and phillips will not help them on the field as rick reed said that stuff is none of my business it 's not something we should deal with let the lame duck manager and the lame duck gm play nice as they are doing now or criticize each other privately as they are probably doing now the organization hopes the players are shrewd enough to treat the distractions like infomercials by tuning them out i think the guys here are showing that they 're professional baseball players who can play the game valentine explained as the season continues there will be other challenges if this was the first hurdle it 's good to get over it phillips added i did n't expect the players to be impacted by this one valentine was leaning back in his office chair when he was asked how his world would be different if the mets had stumbled after his innocuous speech at wharton he nodded knowingly who knows how much longer that chair would have belonged to valentine but the mets have seemingly navigated these waters even though wilpon and nelson doubleday continue treating their 82 million team cavalierly by not giving valentine and phillips contract extensions still there are deeper concerns reed the best pitcher in the league other than randy johnson this season is unsure if he will make his next start because of a bruised left hand bobby j jones has a strained right calf and an ineffective right arm rey ordonez had his first hit with a runner in scoring position todd zeile is adapting to first base those are problems not how the manager and general manager get along valentine should offer another speech and reiterate that the distractions will continue a player will grouse or valentine will be pulled into something but winning obscures these distractions just look at the difference the last nine days have made for valentine and the mets
