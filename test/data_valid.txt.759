in the late 1980 's a blood test for prostate cancer came into widespread use the test the psa can find cancers when they are too small to feel and before they have spread it is only now being evaluated in clinical trials to see if it reduces the risk of dying from the disease gina kolata asked two experts to assess national data on prostate cancer dr otis brawley professor of medical oncology and epidemiology at the winship cancer institute of emory university is concerned national data he said make him wonder whether the psa test is saving many lives the test dr brawley said has led to a huge increase in the number of prostate cancer diagnoses but if the psa was saving lives the early diagnosis of prostate cancer should lead to a sharp downturn in its death rate that has not happened dr brawley said while the mortality rate has fallen it did not fall precipitously and the introduction of better treatments clearly played a role dr brawley said the data indicated that the test was finding tumors that would not be noticed and would cause no medical problems but these tumors look exactly like dangerous ones there are cancers that fulfill all the histological criteria for malignancy dr brawley said when a pathologist looks under the microscope he says 'yes this is cancer but these tumors are not dangerous and many that are dangerous may not be cured by early diagnosis and treatment the concept that every cancer that can be found early can be cured is a faulty concept he said yet with no way of knowing which tumors are potentially lethal doctors usually treat everyone with methods like surgery or radiation that can cause impotence and incontinence while the number of men with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis has gone down dr brawley says the reason is not necessarily that the psa test is finding cancers when they can be cured doctors he said operate and remove the prostate only when they find no evidence that cancer has spread those men are counted as having localized disease but he said within two years 40 percent of them have recurrences the cancer had already metastasized but the spread was not obvious when the original diagnosis was given before the test most of those cancers would have been found after they had spread and counted as metastatic dr brawley worries that some doctors are including psa 's in routine blood tests without discussing these issues if a man understands that the test is unproven and still wants it he should be allowed to get it and should not be criticized dr brawley said at 42 dr brawley has not been tested and does not want to be once a doctor ordered the test on a lab order sheet without telling him i asked her to scratch it off he said
