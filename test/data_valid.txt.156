sky of stone by homer hickam 365 pp new york delacorte press 2495 in recent years we have had a flood of gritty best selling memoirs about the pains of growing up in adversity and eventually triumphing over circumstances the genre is related to the testimonial service in churches where one admits misdeeds confusion and weakness but goes on to describe victory against the odds a genre dear to a nation of people who believed they could struggle through to progress and prosperity homer hickam 's rocket boys 1998 made into the film october sky was a prime example it told of his growing up in the mining town of coalwood wva son of a zealous coal miner who has become superintendent of a mine the first sputnik of 1957 inspired young sonny hickam to build rockets with a group of friends who become known as the rocket boys and who facing opposition of parents and town got timely help from a teacher and a sympathetic machinist and ended up winning national recognition for their work it is a story of a very special and close community and hickam 's clean vivid prose won a vast audience rocket boys was followed by the coalwood way about hickam 's last christmas as a boy in the mining town now sky of stone his third memoir about coalwood tells the story of his first summer working in the mine after completing his freshman year in engineering school the prose of the third book is as vivid and alive as that of the first and the bond with the people of coalwood just as intense and complex but sky of stone is also a mystery story in the spring of 1961 a wise foreman tuck dillon is killed in an underground explosion any miner would have known how to avoid sonny 's father is being investigated as possibly responsible if judged guilty he could be fired even charged with criminal negligence though relations between father and son are strained sonny is ordered by his mother to come home for the summer sonny soon realizes that he must help exonerate his dad he takes a summer job in the mine and joins the union but no one will tell him much about the explosion or the mysteriously broken wrist of a brain damaged former miner nate dooley called a secret man because he is paid even though he can no longer work in the mine sky of stone is a story of the secrets of blood sonny does not understand what his parents or the townspeople are trying to cover up it is a book of thresholds initiations and the bonds that restrain and hold people together in the mine sonny descends into deadly dust deadlier methane gas stinking air and falling rocks crumbling roofs and gob of waste coal and water the rocket boy who has been reaching for heaven to beat the russians descends into the inferno to beat his father who resists his efforts at discovery and his father 's enemies sonny is scared and disoriented he has lived all his life above the mine and the deep passages are terrifying i had no idea where i was after the noise of the man trip faded it became very quiet i could feel a slight breeze in my face i peered around with the feeble light from my lamp trying to catch sight of big jeb when i did n't spot him i held my breath and listened until i heard a distant wheezing it is said that the best stories are not so much about good versus evil as about conflicts of loyalty one good colliding with another sky of stone is a fine example hickam angry and confused enters the mine to help his father but also almost to spite him he has spent his life planning to escape coalwood and homer hickam sr but they have pulled him back he wants to make his way without help yet is dependent on the foreman johnny basso who saves his life from a kettle bottom of rock falling on him and he is helped by just about everybody else in the mine and in the town he falls in love with a dazzling engineer rita walicki but finds she is only interested in winning the right to go down into the mine where women are forbidden because of the superstition that they will bring bad luck a subplot of the book is a track laying competition for the mine 's rail network between sonny 's work crew and a crew from another mine and rita 's efforts to fix the race one of several revelations that teach sonny things he did not want to know the detective story is a moral genre it is about finding truth and placing responsibility in a tangled ambiguous world one strength of sky of stone is its combination of sonny 's personal struggle to become a man with the quest to find out what really happened on the night of tuck dillon 's death sonny is also wrestling with the possible breakup of his family his infatuation with rita his need for friends his need to escape the burden of his home town and family it is a mark of hickam 's skill that he is able to link these separate strands so effectively out of his obsession and frustration with rita sonny begins to learn something about women it is a major step in his growth parallel to his new physical strength gained from the heavy work of laying rails it came to me in a flash the way things so often did rita was not only out to prove false the superstition about women in a coal mine she was also out to show she was good as any man and maybe better it was such an alien concept it was nearly past my ability to grasp it and as it was i was only able to hang onto it for the briefest of moments in the closing chapters one secret after another comes out in the testimonies of various people at a hearing into dillon 's death the story ends on such a note of victory and harmony in the family and community that it is startling to read in the epilogue that much of coalwood is now boarded up the mine long closed it has settled back into the mountain landscape though there is a museum to the rocket boys luckily hickam has made the town live again in his writing a reader will not forget these people the mother with her pet fox and the painting of myrtle beach fla taking shape on her kitchen wall the reverend richard with his eloquent prayers and quotations and his astute reference to the potter 's wheel of jeremiah the foreman johnny basso praying before beginning work the men in the guts of hell with faces blackened and lungs diseased with dust who believe in the worth of the work they do in overcoming odds in loyalty and affection for one another and in ultimate victory if not in this world then the next even the sky of stone glimpsed down in the mine has mica stars that wink promises and suggest secrets robert morgan 's most recent novels are gap creek and the rock correction october 21 2001
