somehow this world series has seemed too short it probably would have seemed too short to new yorkers even if it had gone to seven games each one of them as long as the record breaking first game but if it had to end it could hardly have ended in a finer more emblematic manner than the contest that took place on thursday night between the yankees pitcher andy pettitte and the mets pitcher al leiter who seemed until his final moments on the mound to be growing stronger and stronger all of the yankees usual heroes bernie williams paul o'neill mariano rivera and derek jeter who was named mvp made it possible for the unusual hero luis sojo to win game 5 and with it the 26th world series in the history of this remarkable team few of the fans and probably none of the players have made the pilgrimage directly from yankee stadium to shea or vice versa but during this series we all imagined making it taking the 4 train to the 7 and out to willets point or driving the deegan to the grand central to 126th street or paddling down the harlem river and along the east river and into flushing bay the landscape of these two stadiums and their teams is what carl sandburg would have called big shouldered though perhaps that adjective should be reserved for some eventual october when the cubs at last take on the white sox if you were alive and breathing this week you got a glimpse of gotham that is not often revealed to strangers or to itself the rivalry between the mets and the yankees did not divide the city it united it these breathless games so much closer in score than in the final tally of games won and lost drew fans of both teams into a single vortex no matter how much they claim to differ from each other it became clear this week just how much mets and yankees fans truly share who cares whether the rest of the country was watching or not we were watching and new york loves nothing better than watching itself everyone had ideas of how this series should have worked out the mets in 7 the yankees in 4 a home run battle a defensive duel but those ideas have all been replaced by what has actually happened by 47 1 2 innings of impeccable baseball marred only by one strange moment in the first inning of the second game somehow what actually happened is even better than what we imagined that perhaps is one of the things that sports are really for to replace daydreams with actuality and thereby to fuel new daydreams
