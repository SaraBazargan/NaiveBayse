the bloomberg administration 's proposed budget has eliminated a 10 million fund that was being used to encourage the creation of charter schools by offering them financial help with the renovation and construction of buildings libraries and laboratories the fund established by mayor rudolph w giuliani and the city council in october 2000 and renewable annually was intended to help address what charter advocates said was a serious flaw in the 1998 state legislation creating the schools the absence of money for school properties including leasing building and renovation charter school operators complained that they were having trouble getting established because of the high cost of real estate especially in new york city charter school advocates said yesterday that they feared the loss of the buildings fund which provided up to 250000 for each new charter school would set back the charter school movement in new york city the grants they said had been a cost effective way of helping the schools by leveraging much larger amounts it would be a lot easier for us to borrow money if we had that 250 grand said xanthe jory founder of the bronx charter school for the arts approved last month by the state board of regents city councilwoman eva s moskowitz of manhattan who is the chairwoman of the council 's education committee said she was surprised that the fund had been cut because mayor michael r bloomberg had seemed supportive of new approaches to public education charter schools are publicly financed but independent of local school districts i think charter schools are one of the most important if not the most important educational reform on the horizon ms moskowitz said yesterday they are public schools she said they serve the poorest of the poor i 'm not saying they are the answer to the entire problem but they seem on the right track to me mr bloomberg 's decision to eliminate the fund was first reported yesterday in the new york sun the plan to eliminate the charter school fund comes as mr bloomberg is proposing to make cuts of 358 million to city schools and an additional 115 million in contingency cuts which chancellor harold o levy has warned would reduce critical services to both disadvantaged and middle class schoolchildren some educators said yesterday that in the context of dire budget cuts charter schools serve such a tiny portion of the city 's schoolchildren as to constitute a special interest lobby some of the most prominent charter schools have been founded or supported by politically well connected business leaders since 1998 about 40 charter schools have been created across the state about half of them in new york city said peter murphy vice president of the new york charter school resource center which helps prospective charter school operators some of the charter schools have been started by business people who want to earn a profit others by nonprofit or grass roots groups that include teachers and social workers the schools receive operating money from the state but only at about two thirds the rate of conventional public schools in a january 2001 interview mr bloomberg expressed support for charter schools dennis m walcott the deputy mayor for education made a point yesterday of saying that the charter school fund was established with money that mayor giuliani originally wanted to use to experiment with school vouchers but he said the elimination of the fund had nothing to do with ideology one way or the other it just has to do with the budget issues we are facing he said mr walcott said that the fund had been scheduled to expire in the current fiscal year and that it was never a long range plan
