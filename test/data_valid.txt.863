most of us have freeze frame memories of truly awful moments when the world seemed to turn upside down depending on your age you probably remember exactly what you were doing when you heard that franklin d roosevelt had died or that john f kennedy had been shot or that martin luther king jr was dead or that the space shuttle challenger had exploded sister mary burns 's freeze frame memory takes her back to dec 2 1980 when she learned that four american churchwomen had been raped and murdered in el salvador as it turned out by members of the salvadoran national guard for many americans the news brought home the brutality of a salvadoran civil war that had more than its share of chaos and violence for many roman catholics the murders of the three nuns and a laywoman had even deeper meaning i think that if you ask most women religious where they were at the time they will know sister mary said she was in her brooklyn apartment she recalled writing a paper on how the theory of liberation theology might be applied to new york city 's problems they were ordinary women in many ways trying to do the best they could she said of the four who were killed who were working with el salvador 's poor but they represented something larger for women religious it was as if one of us was killed the work those women did was something we really believed in and it was challenged today the 20th anniversary of the killings many catholics in new york will pray for the martyred women maura clarke and ita ford maryknoll nuns dorothy kazel an ursuline nun and jean donovan a lay missionary tonight at the church of st ignatius loyola on park avenue there will be a benefit performance of missionaries an opera about the women by elizabeth swados the money raised tonight will be divided among several programs including a center that sister mary burns founded seven years ago in bushwick brooklyn dozens of women and men go there immigrants from various spanish speaking countries in search of instruction in english and training in skills that will help them move from welfare to a paycheck you do n't need to look beyond the sign out front to guess who sister mary 's heroes are it tells you as you pass through the doors of the building a former catholic school on menahan street that you are entering the maura clarke ita ford center she never knew either woman said sister mary whose flattened a 's leave no doubt about her boston origins nor is she from the same order as they were for three decades she has belonged to the sisters of charity of halifax but she felt compelled to honor these two women both for their life and their death and for their new york roots queens for maura clarke brooklyn for ita ford they 're from this diocese and it 's good we have something here to remember them by sister mary said obviously even after 20 years the story has n't gone away somehow it remains important it is important enough to echo still in american courtrooms this fall two retired salvadoran generals both now with permanent resident status in florida stood accused in federal court of bearing ultimate responsibility for the churchwomen 's death several enlisted men who were convicted of doing the killing had said they were acting on superiors order families of the victims brought a wrongful death suit in florida against the two former generals charging that they were responsible for a climate of violence that produced the murders federal jurors in west palm beach did not agree last month after listening to weeks of testimony they cleared the former military men sister mary had attended the trial for two days and was startled to learn of the jurors decision it was very disappointing she said then again it was also precedent setting she added the generals had to sit there and they were held accountable in many ways maybe their lives wo n't be so comfortable now all the recent news has not been discouraging for her though far from it last night hers was one of eight groups honored by the nonprofit fund for the city of new york which gave them its union square awards each worth 50000 that 'll keep us going for a few months sister mary said adding that it seems so often that something happens on anniversaries i do n't take coincidences lightly sometimes she said
