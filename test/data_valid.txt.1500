to the editor re senate kills plan for drug benefits through medicare front page aug 1 as a disabled person i find it painful to see that congress has again failed to add a prescription benefit to medicare i worked and paid taxes until i became sick as i have seen congress come up with money for so many things it has been very difficult to understand why the disabled and the elderly are not equally important for many of us these medications are a matter of life itself how can something that people need to stay alive be continuously reduced to a political game why could the republicans not agree to even the pared down version offered in the senate i have already used everything i had saved and charged my credit cards to the limit to pay medical costs people do not choose to get sick or old why are we not important enough to help sharon ford clinton miss aug 1 2002
