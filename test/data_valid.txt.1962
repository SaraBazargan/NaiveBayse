the islanders beat a good team today then grumbled about how imperfect the victory was in other words they finally sounded sort of the way they did last season chris osgood made a season high 38 saves and jason blake scored a third period goal to lift the islanders over the dallas stars 3 2 at nassau coliseum it was the islanders first victory of the season over an opponent with a winning record the islanders 5 9 1 0 won their second straight game after a ghastly six game losing streak the islanders were critical of themselves afterward but they sounded as if they had finally elevated their standards what matters is winning coach peter laviolette said that 's the nature of the beast here the stars 8 4 3 1 have much more speed and skill than the islanders and dallas took 40 shots considering that osgood had a lackluster 793 save percentage four days ago he might have allowed eight goals had this game been played last week but osgood gave up only two goals today jere lehtinen scored dallas 's first goal on a gorgeous power play feed from mike modano then popped in a goal from the slot that tied the score at 2 2 at 5 minutes 51 seconds of the third period generally osgood was so superb that the 14378 in attendance were less reluctant to chant his name after big saves his best save came on a wrist shot by dallas defenseman sergei zubov who had swerved through the islanders defense as if it were invisible we wanted to get the puck out of our zone as much as possible blake said blake scored the game winning goal 1 52 after lehtinen 's second goal eric manlow a 27 year old journeyman who earlier scored his first nhl goal was stopped by stars goaltender marty turco 22 saves but blake flipped in the rebound osgood protected the lead and he had help with less than nine minutes left in the game dallas center jason arnott barged toward the goal and appeared as if he would knock the puck past osgood but the islanders mark parrish tied him up arnott not the puck hurtled past osgood and into the goal where parrish poked him with his stick to keep him from getting out i think we 're trying to make a mental point to work on our defense parrish said that might seem like a strange thing to say after giving up 40 shots but the islanders have been stingier in their last three games with only seven goals allowed their weaknesses are less apparent now that osgood is playing well again that 's my job osgood said when guys make mistakes i cover them up but the islanders have made incremental progress in other areas they entered the game with the worst penalty killing percentage in the nhl but they killed four of five penalties and scored their first short handed goal in nine games today with dave scatchard serving a high sticking penalty shawn bates swept in the puck after it popped off zubov 's stick bates threw a shot over turco 's right shoulder at 16 51 of the first period to tie the score at 1 1 manlow gave the islanders the lead at 18 06 of the second period richard matvichuk was called for high sticking with dallas 's philippe boucher already in the penalty box manlow rammed in a rebound 20 seconds into the two man advantage it bounced around about seven times and it just seemed like i was in the right place at the right time manlow said manlow one of three players called up monday from bridgeport of the american hockey league has drifted around in his eight year professional career but one of his stops was the ahl 's providence bruins his coach happened to be laviolette manlow played nearly 16 minutes today scatchard left the game with a bruised heel early in the second period so laviolette had to scrap some of his line combinations but manlow earned the time by continuing to thwart modano 's high speed line it 's more than i expected but i 'll take ice time when i can get it manlow said scatchard is to undergo an mri test on his heel monday and defenseman kenny jonsson missed another game because of a virus the team said but there is a sense that the islanders may have escaped the bad times we have to keep taking baby steps with that momentum laviolette said
