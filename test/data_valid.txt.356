with the tournament in the new york metropolitan area it is only fitting that it have its own version of the bleacher creatures the famously rowdy fans who preside over the yankees outfield this week a contingent of particularly enthusiastic fans have staked out a standing room only spot along the top row of the grandstands next to the 17th green for them it appears that the location 's virtue lies less in its view of the 17th green than in its proximity to the beer taps at the nearby concession stand yesterday the group well outfitted with plastic cups of beer chanted sarcastic comments to golfers approaching the green they cheered overzealously for unknown golfers and jeered the popular ones many fans in the group said they were hockey players from connecticut who traveled here together when tiger woods played the hole he was greeted by the large gallery with shouts of praise but this group scolded him for consistently deciding not to play the greater hartford open with loud chants of gho gho they frequently delivered play by play narration of shots like baseball announcers as john daly 's tee shot sailed toward the left rear of the green one fan yelled it is long enough it is far enough corey kilgannon
