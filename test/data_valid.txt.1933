propelled by james e mcgreevey 's solid victory in the governor 's race new jersey democrats on tuesday recaptured a majority in the state assembly for the first time in a decade and battled to at least a tie with the republicans in the state senate shortly after midnight this morning the democrats had won 42 of 80 assembly seats and were leading in 3 other races according to late election returns in the senate the democrats fought the republicans to at least a 20 20 tie in late unofficial returns and the democrats said one senate race which at first looked like a republican victory was now so close that they might still have a chance of seizing the majority outright by winning the assembly democrats have guaranteed their governor elect mr mcgreevey substantial leverage in moving his agenda through trenton we are going to be in the majority joseph v doria jr the democratic leader who stands to be elected speaker declared late tuesday it means he has a house that he can work with that is supportive of him on the issues that are important to the people of the state going into tuesday 's election republicans controlled the senate by 24 to 15 with 1 independent who is a former republican and they held the assembly by 45 to 35 meaning the democrats needed to pick up 6 seats in each chamber to win control republicans had held the majorities since 1991 when voters voiced their fury over democratic tax increases the democrats capitalized on a legislative map that was redrawn earlier this year mostly in their favor the redistricting by a state commission moved large groups of minority and some white democratic voters into three traditionally republican districts in the north and the democrats won big in all three perhaps the most symbolic victory came in the 22nd district in suburban union and somerset counties where joseph s suliga a democratic assemblyman from linden won the senate seat that since november 1979 had been held by donald t difrancesco the longtime republican senate president who has served as acting governor the democrats also won two assembly seats there mr difrancesco did not seek re election to his district which was heavily redrawn three republican communities westfield chatham and berkeley heights were removed and replaced with three democratic strongholds plainfield linden and rahway in the 34th district in passaic and essex counties redistricting allowed the democrats to pick up all three legislative seats in the senate race nia h gill a democratic assemblywoman from montclair ousted norman m robertson the republican incumbent the two democratic assembly candidates also won in redrawing the map wayne a mostly republican township was removed from the district and two communities with large numbers of minority voters east orange and montclair were added giving the democrats an edge and in the 38th district in bergen county the democrats won a hotly contested senate race with joseph coniglio a popular civic leader defeating the republican incumbent louis f kosco who was seeking a fourth term the democrats also picked up an assembly seat there state senator joseph m kyrillos the republican party chairman said we drew the short end of the stick on redistricting everybody knows that if the senate is in fact deadlocked it will be the first time in its modern history in the event of a tie vote a bill fails a recipe for gridlock that means there would be enormous pressure for a deal in which one or more senators switched parties officials in both parties said democrats held out hopes that they would ultimately win the senate race in the first district in south jersey there james s cafiero of north wildwood a veteran senator initially appeared to have fought off his challenger william j hughes jr a former federal prosecutor from ocean city but late tuesday democrats said that there was a problem with several hundred ballots and that the result was in question in another major win the democrats picked up all three seats in the third district which includes salem county and parts of gloucester and cumberland counties and is the home of the current assembly speaker jack collins one of the state 's most powerful republicans in the senate race raymond j zane a longtime senator who switched to the republican party in february was defeated by stephen m sweeney an ironworkers union leader one close contest may have saved the republicans from losing control of the senate in the 14th district which includes parts of mercer and middlesex counties the republican incumbent peter a inverso survived a tough challenge from samuel j plumeri jr the mercer county sheriff
