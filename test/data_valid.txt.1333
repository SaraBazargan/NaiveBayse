the atlanta braves constructed a decade of dominance around the fundamentals of baseball strong pitching and solid defense those were their constants as they navigated through the regular season only to see them vanish when it mattered most in the postseason no one embodies that approach more than greg maddux the dominating pitcher who has won 11 straight gold glove awards but maddux failed as a pitcher and fielder tonight as the arizona diamondbacks routed the braves 11 4 to take a 3 1 lead in the national league championship series the diamondbacks are now one victory from their first world series appearance in their four years of existence and the braves are one loss from another bitter exit in october nothing worked out maddux said after the game i made a good pitch i gave up a hit i got a ball hit to me i did n't know where to throw it it 's embarrassing randy johnson who snapped a record seven game postseason losing streak by pitching a shutout in his last start will start for arizona on sunday and will oppose tom glavine who will be pressed into service on three days rest glavine is 9 8 with a 363 earned run average in 25 career starts on three days of rest he has not pitched on that little rest in the postseason since the 1992 world series maddux was starting his first postseason game on three days rest since 1995 and he crumbled he allowed six runs four earned on eight hits in three plus innings his 27th postseason start was the shortest of his career and his postseason record fell to 10 13 maddux also accounted for one of the braves three errors in the third inning which set an nlcs record and resulted in four arizona runs atlanta made four errors over all with shortstop rey sanchez committing two twice braves catchers could not hold on to third strikes allowing the batter to reach first maddux 's misery provided the first surprise in what had become a predictable series johnson pitched a shutout in game 1 glavine won game 2 for atlanta curt schilling threw a four hitter in game 3 on friday according to expectations maddux a four time cy young award winner should have easily beaten albie lopez who lost 19 games this season lopez had allowed four runs in three innings against the cardinals in the division series tonight lopez allowed two runs in three innings and arizona used five relievers to secure the victory atlanta loaded the bases with no outs in the eighth on a grounder an infield single off pitcher miguel batista 's glove and a blooper to center but closer byung hyun kim got a double play and a lineout to end the threat the diamondbacks have not hit well this postseason yet they are on the verge of appearing in the world series because they have johnson and schilling and because the braves have played two horrific defensive games the past two nights arizona scored all its runs in a 5 1 victory friday capitalizing on braves mistakes even by less lofty standards maddux was terrible maddux misplayed a comebacker made a throwing error that scored two runs and was unable to contain an offense that had averaged 225 runs in its first eight postseason games maddux 's matchup with lopez figured to be a mismatch but both pitchers were gone by the end of the fourth with maddux having inflicted more damage atlanta was also supposed to have the better relievers but when the game became a battle of the bullpens the braves had been left with too big a deficit atlanta gave maddux a 2 0 lead on a run scoring double by chipper jones in the first and a home run by andruw jones leading off the second but the braves fell apart in the third starting when chipper jones dropped tony womack 's grounder to lead off womack was caught trying to steal but shortstop rey sanchez then threw away a ground ball by craig counsell who went 3 for 6 with 4 runs batted in for the second error of the inning luis gonzalez followed with a single to right before reggie sanders hit a grounder to the mound maddux fielded the ball looked to third spun to his right to gauge the chances for a double play then turned toward third again by then he had no play the bases were loaded steve finley followed with a liner at maddux 's glove but maddux closed it too soon and the ball popped toward third he chased it and fired an off balance throw home that grazed catcher paul bako 's glove and went to the backstop with nobody behind bako two runs scored and the game was tied 2 2 the pitching coach leo mazzone tried calming maddux but matt williams and mark grace each delivered run scoring singles for a 4 2 lead the diamondbacks scored twice more in the fourth with counsell 's two run double ending maddux 's night in the ninth gonzalez turned the game into a rout with a three run homer after the game a message on a board in the braves clubhouse said we will travel to arizona after the game that may be wishful thinking
