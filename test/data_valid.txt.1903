this racially tense city was placed under a strict nightlong curfew today as the authorities struggled to stop sporadic vandalism and the confrontations with police officers that followed the fatal shooting of a black teenager by the police despite the best efforts of the good citizens of our city the violence on our streets is uncontrolled and it runs rampant mayor charlie luken declared as he announced a state of emergency and ordered that the streets be kept clear of most people from 8 pm until 6 am until further notice acting after four days of confrontation between the police and roving crowds of protesters and vandals mayor luken conceded that there might be very legitimate validity to complaints by blacks about racial profiling by the police but he said the more immediate problem was to restore civil order knock it off now the mayor a democrat told violent protesters who have emerged among groups of young black men protesting the shooting on saturday of an unarmed teenager in an alley by a pursuing officer he was the 15th black suspect killed by police officers here in the last six years and the fourth since november in the first hours of the curfew the city was a ghost town under lockdown police reported a few violent incidents and more than a score of arrests of curfew violators while the mayor claiming initial success cautioned that a long weekend lay ahead the white house announced that president bush had asked attorney general john ashcroft to help calm and resolve the situation by dispatching two justice department mediators to investigate the trouble with the city 's 1030 member police force working 12 hour shifts the mayor said there was active consultation with gov bob taft about the use of national guard troops if necessary to provide relief i do n't expect that situation will arise governor taft said tonight in a broadcast interview seventy five state police officers have been ordered to assist the local police through the day political and church leaders met emphasizing the need for order we are trying to keep our youth in tonight said juleana frierson an assistant to the rev damon lynch iii the influential pastor of new prospect baptist church who traveled from meeting to meeting some families left over the rhine a black neighborhood where much of the vandalism has occurred to seek refuge in calmer neighborhoods complaining of violent young people compounding the problem we do n't want any of this one resident fantasy keahana said as she left cincinnati 's a microcosm the belly of the whale said kweisi mfume national president of the naacp who addressed community leaders on the need to solve the problem of racial profiling by the police it 's important for the nation to focus here on ground zero if we can fix it here we can fix it elsewhere but if it does n't get fixed here it turns into anarchy and all of us are left wondering is justice blind no deaths have occurred in the four days of street violence in which groups of vandals have staged hit and run raids on dozens of stores looting some of them more than 40 people have sought treatment at hospitals including some struck by the rubber bullets beanbags and tear gas the police have fired in efforts at crowd control the police made more than 100 arrests most of them on monday and tuesday shopkeepers in some of the quieter parts of the city could be seen boarding their windows as the curfew was announced the police were instructed to allow only people going to and from work to pass on the streets with property damage mounting violence reported in additional neighborhoods and a police officer reported grazed by a sniper 's bullet overnight the mayor used emphatic language in announcing the curfew and citing a new development civilian gunfire in some incidents gunfire went off like you might hear in beirut or some other place mr luken told the city of 331000 which is 43 percent black as he spoke protesters heckled him with accusations of police brutality we have been telling you for two years about the brutality one person shouted the mayor emphasized that the immediate need was to restore order without regard to what anger and frustration any citizen might be feeling only a week ago the mayor said a curfew was unthinkable some of the city administration 's leading critics did not disagree the fringe has taken over the protest said scott greenwood a cincinnati resident and general counsel for the american civil liberties union the aclu and prominent blacks filed a federal lawsuit against the city last month accusing the police of systematically violating the rights of black residents for 30 years with frivolous arrests and the excessive use of deadly force we ca n't negotiate about police behavior while the entire city is under siege mr greenwood said citing the fatal shooting on saturday of timothy thomas 19 as an example of the very conditions that led us to file a lawsuit the police said mr thomas was shot when officer steven roach who is white thought he was about to draw a weapon no weapon was found and on tuesday mayor luken said of officer roach 's account that the initial finding do n't back him up the police said mr thomas had 14 outstanding warrants when he was shot but mr greenwood said all were for misdemeanors or for traffic infractions five of them for not wearing a seat belt while driving mr greenwood said that 's a charge of last resort when they ca n't get you for something else he said contending that countless blacks had been similarly stopped by police officers the last racial protests that attracted outside attention in this city were in 1968 in the aftermath of the assassination of the rev dr martin luther king jr
