ten years ago when i was diagnosed with parkinson 's disease i suddenly found myself an unwilling member of a group apart from the mainstream the handicapped it was a group whose existence i had always been aware of but had relegated to the periphery of my consciousness now that i was somewhat disabled my sensitivity to other people 's physical limitations became more acute i found myself mentally rooting for anyone with a slower gait using a cane walker or crutches i understood their plight because i had become one of them a person who elicits from passers by either total avoidance of eye contact or ill concealed looks of pity of course people 's kindness became more evident too strangers rushed to open doors for me and graciously offered to help me load groceries into my car i appreciated their thoughtfulness but at the same time found it increasingly difficult to fulfill my desire to be independent and self reliant friends and family members attitudes changed too and although well meaning imposed limitations on me that were not always necessary for example i am a retired teacher and every few months my former colleagues and i get together for a potluck lunch at someone 's home the last time we met everyone volunteered to bring something an appetizer salad main dish or dessert when i asked the hostess what i could contribute i was firmly told you just bring the rolls this was the second time i had been given this undemanding assignment yes it 's true i am a little slower a little stiffer than i used to be but i can still bake a pie simmer a stew or soup and whip up a souffle it may take a little longer but the end results are as good as ever last thanksgiving my husband and i were invited to a friend 's house for dinner our hostess greeted us warmly and graciously thanked us for the wine that was our contribution to the feast my offers to bake a pumpkin or apple pie had been rejected as i came into the kitchen she and her two adult daughters were busy fussing with the final details of the meal when i asked if i could help i was greeted with a resounding chorus of no you go sit down and read the paper sounds of their laughter and camaraderie reached me from my lonely exile in the living room i felt like an outcast the desire for independence the desire to continue doing the usual tasks and to fulfill my normal responsibilities is very strong and i think quite healthy it 's very hard for me to relinquish my lifetime role of nurturer whether as wife mother teacher or friend i recently read an article about a woman who despite her severe arthritis went out every day to do volunteer work she said i just put my aches and pains on the back burner and try to help others this spunky unselfish attitude is probably the best medicine the scottish poet robert burns had the vision and compassion to realize that in spite of material conditions a man 's a man for a that is n't a woman a woman for a that too soapbox rosalie s lawrence lives in briarcliff manor
