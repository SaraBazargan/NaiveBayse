thousands of american business people have canceled travel to asia particularly to china because of the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars but broader economic shock waves from the disease have barely begun to resonate in the united states which is china 's second largest trading partner behind japan and one of china 's biggest sources of foreign investment robert a kapp president of the us china business council in washington the principal organization of american corporations that do business in china spoke on wednesday about short term and potential long term effects of sars rick gladstone q have any large business deals between american companies and china been delayed or derailed because of sars a we are not aware of any large transactions which have fallen through over this but the fact that nobody 's traveling sooner or later has got to have an impact the longer this goes on the more likely the final consummations are going to be delayed we do n't expect a flood of deals while this situation remains q which industries that do business in china have been hurt most which have been relatively insulated a obviously airlines are at the top of the list we 're not seeing the autos the chemicals and so forth being crippled by this most american industrial production has not been affected at the level of administrative staff and expatriates we will have to watch in the weeks to come to see whether the impulse to get some of them out increases as levels of social anxiety rise so does the possibility at least that the normal work styles of expatriate managers and expatriate planners and high end office people could be affected that could make some difference we have n't seen it yet q aside from disruptions to exhibitions conferences travel and so on are you seeing more subtle damage in business and economic relations between the united states and china a the obvious right in your face problems are the problems of holding a trade show the canton trade fair was hurt the auto show in shanghai was called off a week early i was involved in a chinese sponsored conference in beijing and regrettably the final decision to postpone came only yesterday beyond that when we get into subtle damage as distinct and isolated as the travel and hospitality industries are the impact spreads outward from those sectors rooms do n't get used detergents do n't get bought uniforms do n't get cleaned there 's an inevitable spinoff it has a depressing effect on economic activity we 'll see more of that you ca n't keep flying empty aircraft the people who work on those planes wo n't have jobs anymore if the trajectory of this disease goes on in the same manner for a prolonged period and the industrial production workplace is affected that will be a new and difficult challenge for china and for some customers who rely on chinese industrial production for things they need to sell elsewhere that we do n't see yet though it 's not impossible the biggest thing here is that none of us know the duration or virulence of sars and a lot hangs on that q assuming that the spread of sars can be halted soon how long will it take for the economic and business effects to dissipate a my feeling is that at least for china the economic effects would recede rather quickly obviously if an airline goes out of business or a hotel goes into bankruptcy the effects are n't cured immediately but the broad fundamentals for why china has become an important place for business those fundamentals have n't changed at this time and i do n't think they 're likely to by the time these kinds of fundamentals changed because of sars sars would likely have spread globally and many other equations would be up in the air q where would you put sars in a ranking of the most significant problems confronting american chinese business relations in recent years a i think it has the potential to be quite high if this goes on for an extended period crises in china us business have n't swept across all businesses before the biggest crisis was in 1989 during the tiananmen crackdown when vast numbers of companies said let 's get out of here but today that seems like something from another era it almost does n't apply in this ranking even the bombing of china 's belgrade embassy in 1999 or the ep3 spy plane crisis on hainan island in 2001 did n't cause a crisis in business a long run of this disease with a lot of social disruption could cause a more serious business emergency
