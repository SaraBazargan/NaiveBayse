the computer there were no other open applications so that certainly is n't the problem what causes this and how can i prevent it from occurring a a type 2 error on the macintosh operating system is usually related to the mac 's use of its memory in many cases it is because the computer tries to store a bit of data from the program you are using into a section of its memory that can not hold it when this data is rejected it can cause the program to crash although the program crash may not immediately cause your whole system to crash restarting is always a good idea it resets the machine 's memory and returns the system to normal if you can still move your mouse you can restart the mac from the special menu if your mouse has frozen press the small button with a tiny triangle on it located on the front of most recent mac models on the imac the reset button is on the right side near the cable ports type 2 errors can be caused by macintosh extension and control panel conflicts or processor problems but a common cause is insufficient memory one way to try to stop the type 2 errors is to give the crashing program more of the system 's memory to increase the memory allocated to a particular program on your mac quit the program if it is open and find the program 's original icon on your hard drive click once on it to select it then go to the file menu to get info click on the pop up menu under general information and select memory from the list you will see a suggested size for memory allocation listed as well as places where you can type in new amounts for the program 's minimum and preferred ram allotments increasing the numbers here to higher amounts than the suggested memory size will assign more ram to the program if you use the mac 's virtual memory control panel to simulate actual ram try increasing the amount of space devoted to virtual memory q what is an active desktop a the active desktop which is part of the windows 98 operating system lets users add
