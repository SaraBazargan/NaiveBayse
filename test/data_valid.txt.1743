to the editor re on the home front a winnable war by bruce ackerman op ed nov 6 i am beginning to suspect that this generation of americans is not made of the same stuff as those who paved the way for our wealthy and powerful country from the american pioneers who conquered a wild continent to the greatest generation that laid down their lives by the thousands to defeat nazism our country 's history reflects a can do spirit and an iron resolve toward success the war against terrorism is this generation 's first real test but even after the slaughter of thousands of our citizens we still do n't seem prepared to defend ourselves in what could be a long and bloody campaign did the lavish comfort of the 90 's weaken our willingness to get our hands dirty if so we do not deserve what our ancestors left us and it will surely be taken away john van amburg st louis nov 6 2001
