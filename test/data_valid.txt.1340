ten days after the shuttle columbia broke up over texas here is all that is known for sure the seeds of disaster appear to have been rooted in a failure of the left wing but no one is willing to bet what triggered that failure while 12000 remnants of the craft have been picked up along a 500 mile swath of texas and louisiana much of the shuttle america 's first may never be found and the message today from retired adm harold w gehman jr the chairman of the committee investigating the disaster was that with solid evidence hard to come by americans should not expect answers soon this will be a long slog seventeen years ago the challenger investigation homed in fairly quickly on the failure of some inexpensive o rings on a booster rocket and then became a hunt for those who covered up evidence of a long record of near failures the columbia appears to have been brought down by troubles that were not nearly that discernible almost every day brings a new theory falling debris that hit the wing on takeoff still a likely suspect even after nasa embraced that answer and then backed away micro meteoroids they have hit the shuttle before though they never caused serious damage ice possibly we are very careful not to fall in love with any particular scenario admiral gehman said today it would be helpful he said to figure out what piece of the shuttle hit the ground first thus the intense search around fort worth and points west for a clue to what failed first but he cautioned that even if we find out what fell off first we have to find the cause of it and then we have to find the contributing cause of it he added that is a long long way from the statement that ron d dittemore manager of the shuttle program made on feb 2 the day after the disaster we 're making the assumption from the start that the external tank was the root cause of the problem that lost columbia he said then a reference to the large piece of foam insulation that was seen by cameras that were out of focus falling off the tank and hitting the left wing 81 seconds into liftoff on jan 16 that 's a fairly drastic assumption and it 's sobering but just two days later mr dittemore backed away from that statement for reasons still as murky as the air force photograph of the columbia streaking over new mexico with what looked like a jagged injury to the left wing and a dirty plume of debris behind ever since no better theory has emerged just confusion over not only what happened but also what pieces of the doomed orbiter have been recovered while nasa officials insist that everything is now on the table clearly there are prime suspects the investigative board is getting ready to put a mockup of the left wing in a wind tunnel to see what happens when heat resistant tiles are missing or when the brittle material called carbon carbon that protects a wing 's leading edge is cracked the truth of the matter is that no one knows what happens when you propel a piece of insulation at the wing at 700 feet per second said one expert close to the investigation the problem is that it may be a little late to be seeking that answer the ground search has been for telltale pieces of that wing and at least one large segment has been recovered in texas but it was a sign of the confusion that has surrounded the search that nasa gave three different descriptions of where it was found first in fort worth then 200 miles east of that city then 60 miles southeast of it two senior nasa officials also reported the discovery of a flight computer only to declare later that it was an avionics box and today that it was an antenna all this seems symptomatic of an agency that may not be in the best shape to determine by itself what went wrong both in the narrow sense of what hardware failed and in the broader sense of what may have failed inside the agency or among its contractors admiral gehman insisted today that he was prepared for both tasks even if they take far longer than the 60 days formally allotted for his panel to issue a report he said that he was not looking to assign blame but that the lesson of the challenger investigation was that it is impossible to separate the question of what went wrong from the question of who failed to ask the right questions and show the right degree of caution but the differences from the challenger investigation are considerable the first is the most obvious there was clear evidence in the challenger case of where the problem started in the seams of the booster rockets we narrrowed things very fast because it was so evident once we saw the picture that trouble came from that spot said gen donald j kutyna a leading member of the commission that conducted that investigation general kutyna who went on to run the united states space command before retiring said that of course we had to close out every other branch of the fault tree of possible causes but there was little doubt we also realized pretty early that there was something sick with nasa that they were covering up that they knew about this problem from the second flight that they did n't want news of it to get out general kutyna also noted that there was far more politics surrounding the challenger investigation than surrounds this investigation the chairman fo the commission former secretary of state william p rogers was told by the white house that whatever he did he should make sure that nasa emerged in one piece and that the shuttle program went on mr rogers who died early last year did exactly that but his mastery of the ways of washington from handling congress to the art of the news leak meant that he also made sure nasa was forced to clean house but this is a different time washington 's attention is elsewhere on iraq on al qaeda president bush 's interest in space exploration seems well contained in two years in office he has never spent much time on the question of america 's mission in space if that moment comes it will happen only after admiral gehman has found probable cause and that may not be anytime soon
