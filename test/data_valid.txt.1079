an internal british debate over adopting the euro grew more intense today when the government published data that showed overseas investment in britain had soared to a record despite the strength of the british pound the data undercut complaints by foreign companies that the pound 's strength was damaging them by making britain an expensive place to manufacture goods for export further fanning the debate prime minister tony blair acknowledged today that there were some economic benefits from euro membership but he insisted that britain should maintain its prepare and decide policy on signing up for the currency the euro adopted by 11 of the european union 's 15 members has fallen sharply against the pound and the dollar since its introduction 18 months ago that weakness has made british exports to europe in particular more expensive the statements from politicians and business leaders have followed weeks of dispute within the british government over how to present its policy on the single currency either bullish or bearish as foreign manufacturers like nissan motor toyota motor and mitsubishi insist that the pound 's strength against the euro is unacceptable to them these companies along with nestle and others have called in recent days for britain to commit itself to joining the euro such a move would lock the pound into an immutable relationship with the euro zone and remove the risk of exchange rate swings from manufacturers calculations and export sales in figures announced today sir david wright head of the department of trade and industry 's invest in britain bureau said foreign investment here rose to a record 382 billion in the fiscal year almost half of it from the united states 25 percent higher than the prior year there is nothing which suggests that the attitude of foreign companies is being significantly affected by the policy with which we are all familiar in respect to the single currency mr wright said britain prides itself as the favored site among outside investors seeking a beachhead for sales into the european union but there is evidence that the pound 's strength against the euro is eroding the readiness of manufacturers to risk the extra currency driven costs of doing business here this year alone the ford motor company and bmw ag have pulled out of british automotive plants and nissan has hinted it might move production of a new subcompact elsewhere adding to pressures to commit to the euro mr blair faces a competitive challenge from the strengthening economies of france and germany the twin motors of european integration which could leave britain on the sidelines but mr blair faces a domestic political challenge pulling in the opposite direction with his popularity at its lowest in three years a new opinion survey suggested that more than 70 percent of britons oppose abandoning the pound in parliament today mr blair insisted that britain stick to its present view known as the prepare and decide policy that it would join a successful european currency if the euro zone 's performance met british economic criteria and if britons voted for it in a referendum membership of a successful single currency would be good for british jobs mortgages and industry but it must be dependent on the economic tests mr blair said but in remarks typifying british ambivalence he said what would be disastrous for british jobs and inward investment what would mean the immediate loss of jobs and investment in this country is to rule out the euro altogether
