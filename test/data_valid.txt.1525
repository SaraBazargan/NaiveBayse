it was the best pitch derek jeter saw all night a fastball down the middle from the texas rangers colby lewis in the fifth inning jeter pounced on the ball and though he hit it off the end of his bat it carried earnestly toward the fabled black seats in center field ramon nivar the texas center fielder sprinted back in pursuit it was high it was far but it was not gone jeter is not reggie jackson and he did not hit three home runs last night but he almost did jeter smoked homers to right in his first two at bats last night and he followed them with the deep fly that nivar caught at the warning track the fans stood and cheered anyway as jeter retreated to the dugout he had thrilled them enough already the yankees homered four times to support roger clemens who allowed one run in seven innings to beat the texas rangers 6 2 and collect his 304th career victory hideki matsui homered for the third time in seven games jason giambi crushed a ball into the third deck and jeter 's two homer game was his first in two years it 's not often my name 's in the middle of a power display jeter said jeter has never hit three homers in a game but he seems capable of almost anything now sizzling through a prolonged stretch of hot hitting after separating his shoulder on opening night jeter missed seven weeks and was sluggish when he returned as recently as june 18 his average was 247 since then he is batting 401 and looking better than he has in years he 's done this before but in recent years this is probably his longest stretch of being really still with his body manager joe torre said and his hands are so quick jeter has shortened his stride and eliminating movement has kept him from being too eager at the plate when you miss six weeks it 's going to take a while that 's the reason you have spring training jeter said pretty much ever since then i 've slowed things down and gotten a little bit more comfortable i think it 's normal to jump after you 've been gone a while jeter 's first homer was a leadoff shot in the first and he connected again with two outs and a runner on in the second hitting both homers to right field is always a sign jeter is on i 'm not a pull hitter said jeter who has eight homers and a 326 average i pretty much hit it the other way when i 'm going good the second homer gave a 5 1 lead to clemens who said fans must have loved the game because the marquee players hit home runs they also saw a fine performance from clemens who turned 41 on monday and was coming off a shutout in anaheim last wednesday the rangers made sure he did not repeat that performance early when hank blalock homered as the second batter of the game clemens then got ahead of alex rodriguez 0 2 but walked him the early innings were a struggle culminating in the fourth that was when the rangers loaded the bases with no outs on a double by rodriguez an infield single and a walk the pitching coach mel stottlemyre went to the mound as clemens and catcher jorge posada debated pitch selection after the meeting clemens got a popout and a strikeout and faced nivar nivar 23 who was called to the majors last week was looking for his third career hit he made clemens work fouling off three pitches with an 0 2 count and driving him to distraction i wish i could have thrown an eephus pitch for the first time clemens said i was letting it go and that kid was swinging away i was like 'man this would be the night to do it if i was ever going to do it but i think probably joe would have taken me out of the game or he might have fainted clemens spared torre the sight of a blooper pitch but he did go for something unconventional dropping to a sidearm angle for a tailing fastball a surprised nivar bounced it back to the mound where clemens snagged it and threw to first to end the inning pumping his fist at his side clemens was on his way to retiring 12 of his last 13 hitters and the yankees were recovering nicely from a ninth inning loss at oakland on sunday they have lost consecutive games just once in the last month in spite of what seemingly is a devastating loss they come back the next day like it 's a brand new story torre said that 's important especially when you get into september and you know every single game means so much you keep from having that carryover inside pitch jason giambi 's homer was his 32nd this year giving him the american league lead giambi also singled and doubled but bounced into a fielder 's choice in his final at bat alfonso soriano was hit on the right thumb in the fourth but stayed in the game he had minor discomfort throwing but expected to play tonight
