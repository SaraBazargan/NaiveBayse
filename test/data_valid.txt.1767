when the phone rang at her desk she would answer it in her slow and distinctive voice mis ter ro zelle 's off ice for four decades thelma elkjer who died recently at age 77 was the late pete rozelle 's executive assistant but in and outside the national football league headquarters she was much more tall and slender usually in a dark dress she was the commissioner 's feared office sentry who screened his calls and his visitors the guardian of his time on weekends she often took the divorced rozelle 's daughter anne marie to museums the opera and ballet and in a little known moment elkjer pronounced elk yer drew an envelope out of a glass bowl that set the course of nfl history if you 've ever wondered why the giants are in the eastern division of the national football conference with the cowboys the redskins the eagles and the cardinals the answer goes back to when the club owners were merging the nfl and the american football league into two conferences for the 1970 season each with 13 teams the steelers the colts and the browns agreed to join the afl teams in the american football conference which quickly realigned but the nfc owners could n't agree each owner rozelle often said of that realignment meeting wanted his team to be in a division with at least one warm weather site or a domed stadium with teams with large season ticket sales and with teams that are pigeons eventually after several hours of wrangling the nfc owners agreed to put five different divisional alignments in five sealed envelopes into a glass bowl but who would reach into the glass bowl and pull out the deciding envelope i 'll get thelma the commissioner said thelma elkjer pulled out the envelope with the slip of paper marked plan 3 which had the giants the cowboys the redskins the eagles and the cardinals in the east the bears the packers the lions and the vikings in the central the 49ers the rams the falcons and the saints in the west the nfc 's basic structure ever since had she picked any of the other envelopes the giants redskins eagles axis would have endured in the east but some rivalries would never have developed in each of the other four alignments the cowboys were slotted either in the central or west divisions had elkjer pulled out any of the other envelopes the cowboys would have only occasionally played the redskins who turned out to be their fiercest rival or the giants in each of the other four alignments the vikings were slotted in the east division that was elkjer 's only public moment but those in the nfl office remember other moments like the time a small smoky fire occurred in the office kitchen thelma just closed the kitchen just locked it up recalled don weiss once the nfl 's executive director she kept it closed for four or five years we 'd ask pete to tell her to open the kitchen 'you 're her boss we 'd say and he 'd say 'next week i 'll tell her next week but next week never came i do n't think he ever told her but one day she decided to open the kitchen elkjer who never married had been rozelle 's secretary in los angeles when he was the rams general manager then moved to new york to work for him when he was elected commissioner in 1960 she lived in an apartment on east 63rd street about 10 blocks from the nfl office it seemed like the nfl people were scared of thelma even my father said anne marie bratton the late commissioner 's daughter from her fort worth home but she was like a mother to me if my father was away on a weekend i 'd go over to her apartment and she 'd take me places or i 'd play with all her cats yes all her cats and occasionally a stray dog after rozelle retired as commissioner in 1989 and settled in rancho santa fe calif with his wife carrie he opened an office there with thelma in charge but when her move with all her cats was delayed by the illness of an elderly dog she remained in the nfl office for a while as commissioner paul tagliabue 's sentry for whatever reason i do n't think thelma liked jim finks weiss said referring to the late general manager of the new orleans saints whenever jim called after pete retired instead of putting jim through to paul she would just transfer him to me and i 'd hear jim say 'i guess that dog 's still alive even after pete rozelle 's death in 1996 thelma elkjer answered the phone as she had for four decades slowly saying mis ter ro zelle 's off ice and when people reminded her that her boss had died that maybe she should answer the phone differently now she would say it 's still his office
