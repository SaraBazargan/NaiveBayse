senator john mccain cast himself today as a vigorous campaigner for the republican congressional majority and insisted he was not interested in harming gov george w bush 's candidacy at the same time the senator left the door ajar to another presidential run of his own four years from now in an hourlong interview about his political plans mr mccain acknowledged several times that he was walking a very careful line in trying to be loyal to his party while remaining true to the insurgent cause that attracted millions of new voters to the republican primaries this year mr mccain said he wanted to fight to change the republican party from the inside and he indicated he was looking for a rationale to support mr bush that would allow him to go beyond dutiful and distant assurances that he would stand by his party 's presidential nominee slouched in a chair in his senate office and playing with a pen mr mccain said the difference between an endorsement of mr bush and his assurance this week that he would support his party 's nominee was a difference in the degree of enthusiasm there 's all kinds of ways as you know of quote supporting the nominee mr mccain said i 've always said i would quote support he said he needed to explore whether he and mr bush shared fundamental agreements on things that allow me to express the enthusiasm which i want to express i mean he said i 'm not interested in harming the candidate any candidate of my party for president of the united states at the same time he said that in weighing an endorsement of mr bush he also had to consider how the millions of people who had been attracted to his candidacy would react i do n't want them to pick up the newspaper and say 'ehh you know he 's just like all the rest mr mccain noted that bob dole the 1996 republican nominee had been working to bring the two former rivals together he added so it 's a very careful line that i 'm trying to walk and that line is being nonconfrontational with the bush people noncritical of governor bush indeed the senator complimented mr bush and said he had learned from his rival that education was a more critical issue than he had initially realized and he praised mr bush for displaying as governor if not in the south carolina primary a willingness to work with democrats and to try to broaden the base of the republican party and he said he did not have to agree with mr bush on every issue at another point mr mccain indicated that he was well aware that his role model ronald reagan had given no more than pro forma support to gerald r ford after mr ford defeated him in the bitter republican primary fight of 1976 mr ford lost the general election and mr reagan went on to win the presidency four years later mr mccain said i would much prefer not to take that route still in contrast to remarks he made along the way on his campaign bus senator mccain did not rule out another presidential run even though he seemed uncertain whether he could recapture voter enthusiasm a second time around there was a certain magic there he said the fervor the enthusiasm you saw it what 's the shelf life of that you do n't know he said of another presidential race you never say never but contemplation of another run right after this one i 've got too many other things to worry about mr mccain showed little ambivalence about his decision this week to put his energy into campaigning for house and senate republicans whose seats are considered vulnerable in november whether or not they support the ban on unlimited unregulated campaign contributions that he calls the gateway to all other reforms in washington i ca n't litmus test these people he said we are republicans we are all of the republican party we share the same philosophy and goals i would rather try to employ my persuasive powers on them than say 'ok just because you do n't agree with me i would rather have a democrat mr mccain said he hoped that if he worked for other republicans in congress they would be more receptive to his ideas but he also puckishly added that in politics amnesia is a notorious disease that i have seen manifested on many occasions he laughed and added in fact most recently in the last campaign making a playful reference to republicans who did not support him in the primaries senator mccain said that even as he appealed to independents and democrats in his campaign i never campaigned contemplating i 'd become a democrat i campaigned hoping that democrats would support me just as democrats supported ronald reagan recognizing that he was n't going to change his party affiliation or his core beliefs as well he said mr mccain also defended his decision to create a political action committee even though an earlier version of his campaign finance legislation a few years ago had contained a ban on political action committees he said that his organization would only pay for his own travel and that he would not accept the kind of big donations that he is trying to ban but only the limited donations allowed by the election law people in the reform movement understand that we have to have some way of funding travel he said mr mccain acknowledged that with an array of candidates now calling themselves reformers there was the danger of the debasement of the word and he said he had to quickly put meat onto his call for a reform agenda which includes changes in the campaign finance law the tax code the social security system medicare and the military now you have to prioritize those and try to achieve what 's achievable he said and he indicated that after addressing campaign finance he was particularly interested in overhauling social security asked whether mr bush 's proposal for a sweeping tax cut could be squared with his own proposal to use much of the projected budget surplus to pave the way for some social security payroll taxes to be put into private retirement investment accounts mr mccain lapsed into a long silence well i would be glad to entertain their proposals he said but very frankly i do n't see the way you get there without putting some money into the social security trust fund so that 's one of the topics i want to discuss with governor bush returning to one of the most controversial moments in his campaign mr mccain staunchly defended the speech in which he called two leaders of the christian right agents of intolerance i will continue to reject the leadership of pat robertson and jerry falwell he said because of my fundamental conviction that they were leading the party in the wrong direction
