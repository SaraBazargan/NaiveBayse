behind the pricey hotels and pruned palm trees much of this capital and its surrounding villages consist of cramped little streets that a car negotiates with difficulty the politics of this island state of 650000 people run a similarly jagged course a new monarch pitches his smooth vision of a government abandoning repression but feelings on the back streets run more ragged there slogans denounce the absolute rule of the dynasty and warn against imitating the thousands of americans stationed here at the home port of the fifth fleet american style haircuts are the start of being corrupted reads a line spray painted across a concrete wall the khalifa monarchy is now engaged in an effort to still the anger of these poor warrens an experiment being monitored throughout the persian gulf and the arab world beyond this spring king hamad bin isa al khalifa who is 52 made good on the first step toward easing away from one man rule with municipal elections the vote for a national parliament is expected in october repressive arab governments are watching to see if the experiment produces the magic balance required to maintain their grip on power while introducing just enough openness to ease the simmering frustration of the new generation young arabs express increasing anger about their inability to find jobs and buy houses and at watching the world advance while they stagnate they see the campaign against terrorism as an assault on islam and chafe at the inability of the arab world to improve the lot of the palestinians and they seethe how can you stop the fire inside people hissed a rail thin 25 year old man in the government unemployment office here he gave his name then retracted it when he noticed police officers and other officials who materialized behind him people have no chance to live the potential for instability is plain in april islamic opposition groups rallied tens of thousands of people to anti american demonstrations to protest the united states support of israel one 24 year old demonstrator was shot to death after rioters breached the wall of the united states embassy the stencil of his portrait is now spray painted on walls across the island often with the slogan death to america the protests recalled the violence of the mid 1990 's with its deadly friction between between the ruling sunni minority who have most of the wealth and the shiite majority which is largely poor at the time the shiites were barred from jobs in the security services out of fear that they would act in the interests of shiite iran across the persian gulf members of the shiite population staged a violent rebellion seeking a greater voice in running bahrain bombings and violent demonstrations led to about 40 deaths hundreds of militants were exiled and thousands of political prisoners were jailed under draconian security laws the new king who ascended bahrain 's throne in 1999 released the prisoners welcomed home most exiles and abolished the security law under which hundreds of dissidents were imprisoned or exiled in cases handled in closed courts he also promised the first elections since his late father dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution in 1975 this island nation is considered too tiny to serve as a model for say saudi arabia next door the demographics too are different but bahrain does share certain traits with other arab governments there is a big similarity among arab governments in dealing with their people said majid milad al jazeeri a high school arabic teacher newly elected to one of the municipal councils in manama they meet the people 's demands for more freedom with violence with beatings tear gas jail and torture mr jazeeri speaks from experience the police stormed through his narrow street at 3 30 one morning in december 1994 not finding him at home they took his wife and brother hostage until he turned himself in he was accused of trying to re create the iranian revolution in bahrain and was sentenced to three years in jail he was freed for two weeks and then thrown back in this time without charges he stayed in jail until the new king decreed the amnesty before criticism was dangerous but now the road is open for almost any mr jazeeri said noting recent marches over the demand for jobs still people in bahrain wonder how much democracy their ruler can deliver many bahrainis thought they were going to get back the 1973 constitution with a single legislative chamber boasting wide powers instead the king promulgated a new constitution creating an appointed upper house that can effectively block anything the elected parliament does it also gave women the right to vote and run for office as they did in the municipal election there is a step forward toward democracy but it is just a step said sheik ali salman it is less than what people expected sheik ali 37 is the leader and religious guide of wifaq a conglomeration of shiite muslim opposition groups that captured about 22 of 50 seats on the five municipal councils the people lack a voice in the system that is the main problem he said either the king does it or no one else can experts say that in the long run the principal goal of the ruling family is to ensure stability to attract foreign investors who can create jobs but the violence of the 1990 's caused foreign banks and other companies to flee ok if we want full democracy we are going backward but if you compare it to reality it is a big step forward said sawsan shair a columnist at the newspaper al ayam she said that in the old days the ruler periodically threw open the doors of the palace to listen to complaints it was a bedouin system that is still widespread in all persian gulf countries but the growth of the population and the complexity of government show its limitations as a simple form of democratic system we want stability ms shair said and you can not have that without giving people some role in making decisions
