luhring augustine 531 west 24th street chelsea through march 29 direct casting from reality rachel whiteread 's signatory sculptural method has never provided a lot of room for development as the careers of artists from george segal to duane hanson have already proved so not surprisingly ms whiteread 's fourth new york gallery show finds her pushing against its limitations until now she has concentrated on positive or negative casts in plaster or resin of relatively simple single volumes objects rooms houses or recently a big empty plinth in front of the national gallery of art in london in addition her best works are usually site specific the cast plaster plinth was displayed on the real one for example ms whiteread 's latest work is a cast of a staircase with a double switchback a kind of symmetrical t shape with boxy vestibules at its three terminals she exhibits it rotated 90 degrees from its real orientation so that it takes longer to decipher exactly what is positive and what is negative and which way is up because of the staircase 's complexity ms whiteread had to cast it in parts which were then assembled with certain details like conduits and switches added for legibility much of the pleasure and the point of ms whiteread 's work has been its economic dumbness if you will with few exceptions it has been a direct translation of some pre existing unaltered piece of the actual world its power has resided in a form of blind acceptance of the real now ms whiteread seems to be moving toward the kind of sculpture that her previous work reacted against which is considered composed and arranged she had to go somewhere maybe going backward a bit is the only way to find forward roberta smith
