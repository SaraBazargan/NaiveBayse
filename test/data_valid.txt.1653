a year ago a national title seemed inevitable for connecticut and the ncaa women 's tournament served merely as a prelude to a coronation few would be surprised if the huskies 31 1 repeated as champions but this year 's tournament is expected to be a rigorous test for a team that is talented and ravenous on defense but also young and incomplete villanova snapped uconn 's 70 game winning streak with a 52 48 victory in the big east tournament final but the huskies have been seeded no 1 in the east regional and will have the advantage of playing the first and second rounds at gampel pavilion in storrs conn uconn opens next sunday against 16th seeded boston university 16 14 which is making its first tournament appearance a victory would result in a second round matchup against either michigan state 17 11 or texas christian 19 13 on march 25 the east regional 's final two rounds are march 30 and april 1 in dayton ohio the top seeded team with perhaps the most unobstructed path to the final four in atlanta is tennessee 28 4 if they keep advancing the lady vols winners of five ncaa titles will play all four games in the mideast regional in knoxville duke 31 1 which lost only at home to uconn is the top seeded team in the midwest regional the blue devils lead the nation with a scoring average of 816 points they pressure ceaselessly on defense and feature alana beard a favorite for national player of the year the west regional appears to be the deepest the top eight seeded teams are ranked in the top 25 louisiana state 27 3 perhaps the hottest team in the country is seeded no 1 in the west which also includes past ncaa champions texas 25 5 stanford 26 4 and louisiana tech 29 2 lsu overran tennessee 78 62 to win the southeastern conference tournament and won 11 games against teams ranked in the top 25 the lady tigers are led by point guard temeka johnson who averages 57 assists simeone augustus has been voted the top freshman in the country after averaging 153 points a game lsu is deep fast and selfless but faces the prospect of playing the regional semifinals and final on stanford 's home floor this is probably the most exciting year of all duke coach gail goestenkors said on espn 's tournament selection program so many teams can get to the final four and win the title it 's wide open the women 's final four is being played on sunday and tuesday this year instead of the traditional friday and sunday in an attempt to separate itself somewhat from the men 's tournament and to increase its profile if uconn reaches the final four seeking its fourth title in nine years it would face a team from the west regional in one national semifinal the other semifinal would pair the emerging teams from the mideast and midwest regionals in addition to uconn the east regional includes boston college virginia tech and notre dame from the big east the conference received a record seven tournament bids villanova 25 5 drew a no 2 seeding in the mideast regional after defeating uconn but faces the prospect of having to play tennessee in knoxville rutgers 20 7 drew a fourth seeding in the midwest miami another big east team also made the tournament purdue 26 5 is seeded second in the east but uconn 's most difficult opponent in the regional could be third seeded kansas state 28 4 which features a balanced attack with five players averaging at least 13 points one of two things can happen to the huskies now that the 70 game winning streak has been snapped with the pressure off uconn might play relaxed and forceful basketball or still stunned and insufficiently mature with a team that relies heavily on three freshmen uconn may be a year away from title contention the real news might not be that the streak was broken but that it reached 70 games during what eventually was supposed to be a rebuilding phase uconn must remain assertive on defense the huskies defense ranked first in the country allowing opponents to shoot only 324 percent and finished second in allowing only 523 points per game the nagging questions are on offense where diana taurasi is playing while hurt and her teammates are playing unevenly we do n't have enough other scorers coach geno auriemma said after the loss to villanova we have to get our bearings offensively many consider taurasi to be the best player in the country but she has been bothered by a wrenched back and a bone spur in her right ankle she can still dominate a game but it remains to be seen whether she can score 30 points when her team is in a bind in a tournament game she 's trying to hang on auriemma said recently of taurasi 's injuries if taurasi is at less than her best additional pressure will be placed on the perimeter shooting of the junior guard maria conlon and the freshman guard ann strother and on the inside play of the sophomore center jessica moore and the freshmen forwards barbara turner and willnett crockett a year ago with a lineup that featured the seniors sue bird swin cash asjha jones and tamika williams uconn finished 39 0 and took all the suspense out of the postseason they are gone and engaging uncertainty has returned to the tournament now it 'll become fun auriemma said
