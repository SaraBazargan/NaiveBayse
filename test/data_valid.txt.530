to the editor the interesting article on doppler radar now the weather brought to you by doppler radar jan 4 makes a common error when he says that the pitch of a horn appears to increase as the car approaches actually the pitch depends only on how fast the car is moving toward or away from you and if a car is approaching at a constant speed the pitch of its horn remains steady the pitch is indeed higher than it would be if the car were n't moving but you have no way of noticing that directly what you do notice is that the pitch drops as the car passes you then it continues at a pitch that is again constant we astronomers measure the expansion of the universe using the same doppler effect that meteorologists use to measure winds on earth jay m pasachoff williamstown mass the writer is professor of astronomy at williams college and author of a field guide to the stars and planets
