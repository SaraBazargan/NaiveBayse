tenants of independence plaza north in tribeca long considered one of the best housing deals in lower manhattan say they fear that the expected sale of the apartment complex next spring will result in rents that force them from the neighborhood the soon to be landlord of their complex three sleek 40 story apartment towers plans to withdraw the buildings from subsidized housing under the mitchell lama program residents fear that rents could as much as triple though laurence gluck the property investor who plans to buy the complex said it was too early to tell what the rent increases might be residents mostly elderly and of moderate income say they did not have to move after the world trade center attack just blocks away and should not have to do so just because the property will change hands how much more do we have to take asked diane lapson who moved to the complex at greenwich and duane streets in 1975 and was one of its original tenants people did n't want to come visit me there was nothing here ms lapson recalled we built tribeca before it even was tribeca ms lapson and about 50 other tenants of the 1330 unit complex marched several blocks from their front lobby to city hall yesterday using their protest posters as snow shields they joined more than 200 other people at a rally that called on mayor michael r bloomberg to create a 10 year plan for lower cost housing in new york city william wagner a real estate agent who brokered the sale of the complex to mr gluck said it was likely to go through next spring he would not say what mr gluck had bid mr gluck said yesterday afternoon that he had not heard about the protest march but he said he had met with tenants recently and had listened to their concerns and hoped that his purchase of the building would involve as little disruption as possible in addition to renovating the building he said he plans to remove the property from the mitchell lama program that program gives developers tax incentives for keeping rents low and allows them to withdraw after 20 years by paying full taxes and paying off the long term bonds used to finance construction people are very emotional about their homes and i respect that mr gluck said i have thousands of apartments that i manage and this is business but there 's a human side to it that someone in my position has to be mindful of or you ca n't be successful mr gluck said he did not know yet whether he would raise the rents to market rate a common practice after a property is removed from the mitchell lama program about 70 percent of the independence plaza north tenants qualify as rent burdened or eligible for rental assistance programs to support them in paying any increased rent he said as for the remaining tenants he said i do not have a plan for future rents for people who are not rent burdened mr wagner said that if rents were raised to market rate at independence plaza north a 1000 square foot two bedroom apartment could cost as much as 3000 a month currently the base rent for a two bedroom unit is 924 a month he said gertrude stein 79 who has lived in the complex for 10 years with her husband philip a painter said we will be at the very mercy of the new landlord because of our age everything 's within walking distance she said if i move to new jersey i 'll have to get a car and who knows how long that will last the couple live on their social security payments and mrs stein 's pension even with rental assistance programs they said paying increased rent will be nearly impossible we do n't know what we will do said mr stein 83 who attended yesterday 's rally with his wife we have no place to go
