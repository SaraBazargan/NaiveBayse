in a speech in early june well before iraq dominated dialogue in the capital representative richard a gephardt endorsed the use of the military to disarm saddam hussein should diplomacy fail today in signing on to a resolution that would give president bush that authority mr gephardt the house democratic leader from missouri gave the white house some cherished high level democratic support in its drive to move against iraq in doing so mr gephardt broke publicly with his longtime friend and ally senator tom daschle the majority leader angered some in his party and gave other democrats a compromise resolution to rally behind we have to do what is right for the security of our nation and the safety of all americans said mr gephardt in a rose garden celebration of the agreement between president bush and house leaders on the language of the resolution it was significant moment for mr gephardt a once and possibly future presidential candidate who had been a vocal opponent of the resolution authorizing the 1991 persian gulf war with his endorsement of the resolution mr gephardt places himself in the hawk wing of his party at a time when national security matters are rising in importance in retrospect i must say that i think that was not the right vote mr gephardt said of his opposition to the gulf war resolution in an interview today republicans said mr gephardt 's support was essential particularly given that the chances of getting mr daschle 's endorsement of a resolution the white house could back seemed to fade late last week it speaks volumes if the democratic leader of the house is working with the speaker and the president said nicholas e calio the white house congressional liaison mr gephardt said he was finally won over by changes in the resolution that made the role of the united nations more prominent limited the scope and required more presidential reporting to congress but senator joseph r biden jr delaware democrat who is chairman of the foreign relations committee expressed frustration that mr gephardt 's action sapped momentum for an alternative proposal he was circulating in the senate mr gephardt 's aides said they worked with mr daschle 's office throughout the talks that concluded today a spokeswoman for mr daschle said he understood mr gephardt 's decision but some of mr gephardt 's fellow house democrats were not happy with his prominent role in moving the resolution forward several said anger was expressed in floor conversations about the alliance with the white house representative jose e serrano of new york said some members are saying that it was kind of shocking to see the display of unity at the white house lawn when so many of us were still grappling with the issue the most positive thing to say is that he softened up a resolution that would have been much more repugnant to democrats said representative charles b rangel of new york gephardt aides said his goal was not to change the minds of opponents of the war but to provide members who were undecided or who wanted to support the president with language they could accept new support was quickly voiced by some democrats this new resolution addresses many of my constituents concerns while also allowing us to address the clear and present threat posed by saddam hussein said representative jane harman of california others said democrats were worried about fallout from a visit to iraq by three democrats who created an uproar when one member representative jim mcdermott of washington suggested that the president might mislead americans to build support for military action mr mcdermott said today that he might have overstated his case but he and representative david e bonior of michigan who also traveled to baghdad continued to press for a diplomatic resolution mr gephardt said that he would not advise any of his fellow democrats how to vote and that in the end he expected the house and senate to come together in a broad bipartisan vote for a resolution as the president said this morning war is my last choice said mr gephardt recounting the meeting between mr bush and congressional leaders he said the president told them that he did not want to hug spouses of people who get killed i believe him and i feel the same way mr gephardt said this is not something to trifle with
