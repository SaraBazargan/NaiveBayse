there are no more secrets in the nfl draft some executives claim but the players picked by the giants in the second and third rounds are at least highly classified with backgrounds more typical of double agents than of football players osi umenyiora second round pick born in london grew up in nigeria played defensive end in obscurity at troy state in troy ala vishante shiancoe third round pick parents from liberia first name is indian last name african attended morgan state in baltimore and played tight end because scouts and executives were enthralled with their physical potential the giants were willing to risk the inevitable criticism if these small program gambles do n't pay off the giants added a second layer to their thin defensive line in the first two rounds of the draft picking defensive tackle william joseph in the first round before taking umenyiora in the second they later added a tight end in shiancoe a cornerback in roderick babers and seven other players they did not use any of their first four picks on offensive linemen their two vacant starting positions are expected to be filled by candidates already in the organization this evening the giants were in the process of signing a handful of undrafted players including two defensive linemen the giants did not draft a running back and general manager ernie accorsi indicated it was now highly unlikely that they would trade the unhappy back ron dayne if they did and tiki barber were to be injured the veteran dorsey levens would be the only experienced backup dayne creates a problem if you trade him because we 'd have to get another one accorsi said if you put a highlight film together a long one of ron dayne 's play with the new york giants it would be awful impressive accorsi added so i feel very good about him staying right here the giants have plucked relative unknowns from small college programs before with intermittent success they picked ron dixon out of lambuth college in the third round in 2000 and because of dixon 's speed the giants hoped he would develop into a dangerous kick returner and wide receiver but dixon has never blossomed the way the giants envisioned first becoming tentative on kick returns before losing that job and later becoming generally unreliable fassel suspended him last season for missing treatments after he hurt his knee because of dixon 's mediocrity the giants were compelled to use a second round pick last year on wide receiver tim carter in 2001 the giants selected cornerback william peterson of western illinois in the third round a gamble but not because peterson came from a small program he had played at michigan but was thrown off the team because of off field trouble the giants took him anyway and peterson became a terrific starting player accorsi and the giants staff gambled on a player from a small program last year picking jeff hatch out of penn in the third round because of his athleticism hatch missed the season with a back injury but he has worked his way back into condition still until he plays the giants will not know whether they reached too far and similarly the team 's 2003 draft will depend heavily on how much umenyiora and shiancoe contribute i believe in big schools accorsi said we pick a lot of miami players a lot of big ten players but that does n't mean that guys do n't go to other schools we would be here until 4 o'clock in the morning if we were listing hall of famers from the morgan states and gramblings of the world umenyiora did not begin playing football until late in high school in auburn ala and was recruited by only troy state and samford but umenyiora excelled at troy state and the giants were attracted to his speed this guy can fly off the edge said jerry reese the giants director of player personnel and he 's not a little guy this kid 's got some size he 's not like an undersized situation pass rusher he 's only been playing the defensive end position for the last couple of years but i do n't want to say we reached too far for him umenyiora said he was surprised to be drafted in the second round but i 'm not surprised because the new york giants look at players through an unbiased eye the giants coaching staff reached the conclusion in its draft meetings that the most effective offensive set last season included two wide receivers tailback tiki barber and two tight ends jeremy shockey and dan campbell but campbell went to the dallas cowboys as a free agent and the giants looking for a replacement added shiancoe who excelled at the league combine and told rosie brown a giants scout that he was better than shockey shiancoe is a downfield threat averaging 204 yards on his 25 receptions last year he had five touchdown catches and he will be expected to improve his blocking before he has a chance to assume campbell 's role i 'm a tenacious blocker shiancoe said there 's always room for improvement and they 'll be teaching me accorsi and coach jim fassel expressed satisfaction that the team had improved in the draft that holes had been filled now all we need fassel said is to be right on our draft choices
