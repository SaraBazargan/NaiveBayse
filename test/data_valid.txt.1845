the most brilliant manager in the history of the new york yankees at least in this century sat behind his desk in his yankee stadium office yesterday afternoon a day after guiding his team to its fourth world series championship in five years this one was the toughest said joe torre and perhaps the most improbable this five game series victory over the mets was in its cockeyed way as remarkable as any of the other 25 won by the bronx bombers dating back to their first in 1923 when the mighty babe was discovering that a ballpark sometimes seemed no bigger than a birdhouse no team had ever gone into postseason play as bedraggled as woebegone as akin to a car puttering along with four flat tires as the 2000 yankees losers of 15 of their last 18 games at regular season 's end but now here sat torre his deep set eyes serene after having not gone to bed until 5 am as aglow within one might guess as the diamond studded world series ring on his finger this one he said holding up the ring is from last year 's championship i 'll change to the new one just as soon as i get it one can hardly fault him for wishing to stay au courant after all there is that weighty pinstriped legacy looking over his shoulder literally on the wall behind him was a framed drawing of five of the most prominent yankee managers of the previous century miller huggins who led the team to six pennants and three world championships in the 1920 's joe mccarthy whose 1931 1946 yankees won eight pennants and seven world series casey stengel manager of 10 pennant winners and 7 world series winners from 1949 to 1960 and a record five titles in a row and billy martin who netted two pennants one world series championship and five separate and wacko terms as manager torre was asked where he saw himself in the history of great yankee managers he did n't he said he could hardly believe his luck i was in the game for 30 years before coming here he said remarking on his years as a player for 16 years with the braves the cardinals and the mets and as a manager for 14 years with the braves the cardinals and the mets torre had never been in a world series game before joining the yankees in 1996 and was only in the playoffs once as manager of the braves it was like there was always one step up to reach the top of the hill but we i kept slippin he said now it seemed i had someone holding my arm and helping me to reach the top as one of his predecessors casey stengel had said i want to thank all the players for giving me the opportunity of being what i was torre has expressed equal if somewhat less convoluted appreciation for his troops not only did torre come to the yankees with a sub 500 career managing record so did huggins and stengel mccarthy had won one pennant in five previous seasons with the cubs and none with boston after he left the yankees and none of those managers had to contend with division and league playoffs making entry into the world series more grueling than ever did torre believe he was a better manager now than in previous jobs i do n't he said for one thing i have an owner who i can talk with directly who will spend the money to get the players i think i need i do n't think i had that before and your players know that and often respond accordingly the yankees have often seemed to do that so where lies the art of the manager look to the losing streak he was so patient billy connors the pitching coach said yesterday it was amazing he never screamed he never hollered he did crack the occasional joke i had to laugh otherwise i 'd cry torre said we were n't playing well because our pitching was poor i believed it would come around i had to show patience as for torre 's strategy in winning i know i get a lot of credit for that he said he recalled the last game against the mets on thursday night i started vizcaino at second base ahead of sojo because he hits al leiter better jose vizcaino was lifted for a pinch hitter late in the game luis sojo went to second for defensive purposes and then torre said luis comes up in the ninth and gets the big hit off leiter to win the game i guess that shows you how smart i am as smart or smarter than any manager in the 21st century and he 's making a good case for himself for all the other centuries too as casey also said you could look it up
