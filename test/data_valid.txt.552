harry caray was sputtering defiance after the loss cubs are gon na win he shouted cubs are gon na win this prediction came from behind a cardboard cutout of caray the deceased icon of the broadcasting booth the mask with caray 's trademark outsize horned rim glasses was sported by johnny dolan who had driven 22 hours to view an event that had not happened in his lifetime a pennant for the cubs instead thousands upon thousands of cubs fans had to watch a cocky young pitcher named josh beckett throw a two hitter and also buzz a fastball near sammy sosa 's prominent mandible bone as the marlins survived the cubs 4 0 to extend this national league championship series to a sixth game after 58 years what are two more days just because chicago has been waiting for another pennant since the early days of the truman administration that does not mean the windy city has to go into psychic shock all those fans wearing a sosa 21 jersey or a banks 14 jersey in alien territory yesterday could recite the familiar litany of disaster in chicagoland these fans know how the 1969 cubs blew an eight and a half game lead over the mets that august and how the 1984 cubs had three straight chances to dispatch san diego in the league championship series only to fail steve garvey muttered brian howard of elgin ill mentioning one of the chief tormentors in the debacle of 1984 i was in the seventh grade it still hurts the fans know all these dreadful chapters in the 128 year history of the franchise yet they refused to panic at least outwardly to a stranger in the crowded corridors after the game they had worn their bright cubbie blue paraphernalia into the pastel football stadium in the outback of south florida as the cubs had a chance to wrap up their first pennant since 1945 far from the sidewalks and elevated trains of the second city the jinx could have been lifted in front of fans wearing sandberg 23 jerseys and santo 10 jerseys in honor of all the stalwarts who never got to celebrate a pennant with the cubs now they must wait until the series moves back to chicago tomorrow we did just fine here said rob strom of chicago who brought his 7 year old son kevin down here with him we won two out of three here that 's all you can expect strom does not believe in the ancient curse levied by an angry fan who was not allowed to bring his pet goat into a world series game in 1945 the sianis family which owns the billy goat tavern just north of the loop has long since patched it up with the cubs and tried to exorcise the curse greek americans gloomily note however that greek curses are not easy to eradicate until further notice the cubs still suffer one of america 's long standing sporting droughts the 1951 brooklyn dodgers the 1964 philadelphia phillies the 1978 boston red sox and the 1982 and 1986 angels from anaheim calif all suffered ghastly collapses but few franchises have suffered long range institutional heartbreak like the cubs who have not won a world series since 1908 of course there are the red sox currently playing out their own gloomy destiny up in boston i think this is a better team than the 1984 team strom said staying upbeat the cubs have been lovable losers at times but dusty baker has done a great job strom does not expect to come up with one of the expensive tickets for the sixth game in wrigley field tomorrow night it was cheaper to fly down here he said many of those wearing blue gear in the marlins stadium had endured decades when all they had to celebrate in chicago was day baseball the ivy on the outfield wall the low red brick wall behind home plate the effusive bellow of harry caray and the chirpy mantra of ernie mr cub banks let 's play two all the fans had seen horrible things happen to the cubs i jinxed them said gene leary formerly of chicago now of fort lauderdale i never see them win i 've been a lifelong fan for 100 years could she remember the last pennant at the end of world war ii when the cubs lost to the detroit tigers no leary said i mean i probably could if i wanted to but i do n't the cubs fans have every reason to anticipate a clinching on home ground tomorrow behind their young pitching star mark prior and if that does n't work there will be a seventh game and they will have their other ace kerry wood so everything is fine they 're going to have to face prior in 50 degrees at wrigley announced jonathan weiser of winnetka ill who is not old enough to remember 1984 much less 1969 they wo n't be able to handle that weiser comes by his enthusiasm through his mother susan weiser who in turn was indoctrinated by her mother i was going through my mother 's things a few years ago susan weiser said and i came across a letter from the cubs putting 1969 world series tickets on sale she saved the letter all those years the world series never came around in chicago in 1969 this is why the entire weiser family was wearing t shirts that said any team can have a bad century the nice thing about cubs fans is their optimism in the face of history there is still time for fear and trembling plenty of time
