korean restaurants have now established themselves in manhattan beyond their familiar herald square zone the next step dae jin hwang says is to show americans that korean restaurants have a lot more to offer than grilled beef mr hwang 's first restaurant mandoo bar was a step in that direction specializing in house made dumplings but it was still situated in koreatown his new place muzy which opened in may in the east village is a bolder break from the past offering a small menu of light appetizers and noodle dishes with just a few meat oriented selections and a choice of fresh juices muzy which seats about 15 people practically disappears into the streetscape between a mexican restaurant and a middle eastern takeout spot yet it is pleasingly sleek and minimalist with contoured walls made from what appear to be silver and gray industrial tiles each place is set with pretty little dishes and bowls and a wooden rest for a spoon and chopsticks muzy which mr hwang said means something very much beyond breaks with the korean tradition of setting out panchan little nibbles to begin the meal instead there may be slender carrot and cucumber sticks with an earthy dipping sauce or thin slices of pickled white radish though the emphasis seems to be on light dishes muzy 's food ca n't help offering the robust lusty flavors that characterize korean cuisine pan fried mandoo or dumplings stuffed with minced vegetables 495 and served with a vinegary dipping sauce are delicate and delicious while rectangles of sauteed tofu 450 barely crisp outside soft and porridgelike within go well with fiery hot sauce pa jun a big scallion filled pancake 850 is lively and satisfying especially when filled with shrimp and squid 1150 eat it right away while it is crisp and warm otherwise it turns gummy this can be a problem if you eat american style with each person ordering an appetizer and main course waiting politely for everyone to be served muzy serves korean style with foods arriving haphazardly and placed in the middle of the table my advice do n't wait and share noodle dishes occupy central stage at muzy including unusual offerings like somen 750 ramen like japanese wheat noodles stir fried with mushrooms tofu and other vegetables and given a light ginger sesame flavoring giant casseroles of curly egg noodles filled with hot chili spiked broth greens tofu a poached egg and elongated mountain vegetables resembling ginseng arrive boiling at the table they will make fabulous cold weather meals whether with chicken 950 beef 1050 or seafood 1250 more familiar korean specialties also showed well like bibimbop 1150 the rice casserole stuffed with vegetables bits of beef and an egg sauteed pork 1250 served in a spicy sauce with onions and peppers is delectable and hearty when scooped into a giant piece of lettuce but bulgogi 15 the slightly sweet barbecued beef dish that mr hwang feels is overexposed is dull and wan the small list of beer and wine is perfunctory but not so the juices a blend of apple and orange juice 450 is tart and wonderful while the ginger limeade 450 manages to be spicy and refreshing at the same time muzy is still evolving mr hwang says witness its prospective dessert list offered on the menu but not yet available which has intriguing offerings like peanut butter and banana in a korean wrap attempts at an explanation of this dish met with an insurmountable language barrier but i could n't help feeling that if it were fried in butter it would be as american as elvis presley muzy 81 st marks place near first avenue east village 212 533 6876 best dishes mandoo sauteed tofu pa jun seafood pa jun somen noodles egg noodle casseroles bibimbop spicy sauteed pork fresh juices price range appetizers 450 to 1150 main courses 750 to 15 credit cards american express mastercard visa hours monday through saturday 5 pm to 1 am sunday noon to 10 pm wheelchair access step at entrance restroom is narrow
