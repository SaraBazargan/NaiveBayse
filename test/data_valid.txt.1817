six weeks ago they both saw it coming the e mail messages whisking back and forth between lance armstrong in europe and chris carmichael in colorado predicted armstrong was going to have a rough ride in this year 's tour de france there are some small signs of lance starting to age so to speak carmichael his personal coach and friend said even when they are 5000 miles apart they are close carmichael sends out the daily workout from his base in colorado and armstrong wherever he is training ships back his reactions you ca n't just see it it 's a feel carmichael said yesterday by telephone from france during a rest day in the tour it 's not power data not his heart rate the heat bothers him more he does n't rebound as well from each workout their frank appraisal six weeks ago has come true armstrong is 31 not the same beast he was when he won the tour the last four years he has had to struggle to gain a 1 minute 7 second lead over jan ullrich of germany after monday 's duel on the brutal slopes of the pyrenees armstrong bounced back from a spill on monday the leaders observed the code of the pack by slowing down and later armstrong widened his lead only to have ullrich fight back for precious seconds lance attacked for the first time this tour and ullrich raced the last few kilometers uphill as if he were sprinting for a world championship carmichael said yesterday still in awe it was the greatest sports event i have ever seen think about this for a second everybody can come up with the greatest sports event i have ever seen whether it is mickey mantle hitting one into the upper deck off barney schultz to win a world series game or magic johnson playing the pivot for the injured kareem abdul jabbar carmichael who raced in the 1986 tour and caught a stomach virus and could not finish picks monday in the pyrenees this tour seems to have caught the imagination of people everywhere i got an e mail message from a friend who watched armstrong and ullrich live at night at her home in yokohama japan the sports and news radio stations in new york which cringe at world sports like soccer are providing awed updates on lance armstrong maybe it 's the name eating her heart out because we are stuck with a cable system that does not provide the outdoor life network my wife finds french news programs to watch clips of armstrong because of his survival from cancer armstrong was a legend going into this tour now in his struggle he has only added to his legend lance is pretty stoked carmichael reported yesterday from a chateau somewhere near bordeaux he has been taping segments for oln and giving advice to his friend while not interfering with johan bruyneel the multilingual dutch coach of the united states postal service team armstrong and carmichael go back to 1990 when carmichael was coach of the united states team at the world championships and gave armstrong orders to hang back armstrong a brash texan promptly waved and rushed toward the front later carmichael said he liked armstrong 's moxie but added that lance 's stubbornness had cost him a medal a year later carmichael predicted you 're going to win the tour de france one day before that could happen armstrong was treated for cancer that struck his testicle lungs and brain carmichael was the first person to prod him to cycle again competitively they went back to beech mountain in north carolina where armstrong had once won a key race and while armstrong trained carmichael drove next to him and shouted allez lance allez allez carmichael 42 runs the carmichael training systems in colorado springs and keeps in touch with armstrong via their laptops he is also the author with jim rutberg of the ultimate ride recently published by the putnam publishing group in the book carmichael stresses training over every mile of the tour find the manhole covers the storm drains the potholes and the fastest lines through the corners he advises visualizing the line of riders the crowds cheering and banging and waving their arms and even the crashes as well as the sprints for the finish line armstrong has become obsessive about this form of preparation carmichael also gives his advice for armstrong 's physical training oxygen delivery to working muscles is the limiting factor for endurance performance which means the aerobic system needs to be the cornerstone of endurance training recently carmichael said we do n't even claim to have an off season three or four years ago he could afford to take a little more time but now he just ca n't my approach is he should never be far from 10 percent of peak condition at any time very few athletes do that that way if there 's a crisis like breaking a collarbone or some flare up if he misses a few weeks that puts an extreme amount of pressure on you he 's on his bike all year carmichael said it gives him confidence if he 's the best prepared guy on the tour people see his demeanor brash cocky whatever you want to call it but it all comes back to the preparation six weeks ago i asked carmichael to name armstrong 's chief competitor if lance can reach his condition of 2001 2002 i do n't think anybody 's going to ride through him and win he said then he named a few good riders but added ullrich is the complete package he 's got a good team he 's experienced he has n't done much the last few years so he 'll be motivated five thousand miles away armstrong also named ullrich he 's won the tour de france armstrong said referring to 1997 you ca n't say that about many guys he 's one of the biggest enigmas in cycling he 's a special rider now they are separated by 67 seconds with five stages to go including sunday 's dash to the champs elysees in paris usually the final sunday is a celebration of the riders and the bicycles and the circular tour of that beautiful nation this time there could be an epic sprint between armstrong and ullrich nothing comes easy this tour sports of the times correction
