was the belichick shuttle about oedipus money power personality disorders and football or was it about something really important the sports rivalry between boston and new york the rivalry is mostly a media creation said dr howard katz a boston psychiatrist who grew up in chicago as a white sox fan it 's what you 're doing every day you have a sports page to fill and here we have several sports talk radio shows alan klein an anthropologist at northeastern university in boston thinks the rivalry is real and positive it provides a social cohesion in a fragmented city he said we can all think of ourselves as losers together a major fear is that pedro martinez will pitch the red sox into the world series and win red auerbach who lived in washington even when he coached the boston celtics said i like both cities but there is a cockiness about new york that makes you really want to beat them i always really wanted to beat them most of it was personal when bill belichick was reported to have quit as jets head coach after holding the job for only a day the analytic waters churned was he getting a better deal with the new england patriots or just afraid to step into bill parcells 's shoes had parcells masterminded this to demand draft choices for his former assistant and also to tighten his control of the club under the new ownership perhaps it was belichick more devious and angry than any had ever imagined he would slay parcells the father by going to work for his archenemy robert k kraft and then coaching the patriots to the super bowl championship that under coach bill had just eluded them that may have been the key just eluded them boston seems always a tittle away from the title in a field of dreams that will never come true that wistful 'day late dollar short yet we still love our teams has often been portrayed as a boston characteristic said dr katz a prime mover in the sports wing of the american psychoanalytic association but i 'm not sure there is one unifying boston mentality the red sox mentality is different from the bruins mentality and from the celtics mentality auerbach would agree to that as the celtics coach and chief executive he is still the national basketball association prototype patriarch of a winning dynasty you always like to win in new york said auerbach who was born and raised in the williamsburg section of brooklyn like the saying goes 'if you 're outside new york you 're in the country it was hard to beat new york because they always got the breaks referees were afraid of incurring the wrath of the new york media which was national anything negative would get back to the league office so how come you beat new york so often you always keep fighting them growled auerbach 82 who still plays racquetball three times a week then his voice became confidential with a story he has only told for 62 years in 1938 as a point guard at george washington university young red looked forward to playing in madison square garden in the national invitation tournament then the pinnacle of collegiate basketball we had a hell of a team and we were promised a spot he said ned irish at the garden asked us to play nyu at the brooklyn college of pharmacy and we beat 'em twice and then he gave our spot to st john 's we were double crossed he was protecting the new york teams from us though it fueled a personal vendetta against new york the personal was political that kind of double cross auerbach said was very new york years later sonny werblin made him an offer to take over the knicks auerbach was on his way to new york with his lawyer but bostonians on the street begged him to stay he deferred the decision which was left open the celtics were soon sold to more congenial owners auerbach said he never regretted not switching jobs he did n't say whether he would have moved to new york if he had switched it was because of a daughter 's asthma he said that he always commuted from washington i do n't dislike new york he said and how can you not like boston all that culture the energy of the young people the anthropologist klein who was born and raised in buffalo has been in boston for 20 years he is the author of baseball on the border a tale of two laredos princeton among other books he said i think the rivalry plays a larger role in boston than it does in new york bostonians feel that so much has been taken from us as a frame of reference losing babe ruth to the yankees the so called curse of the bambino is right on the money last season i went to some interleague games at fenway and i was amazed at the loud mouthed arrogance of some new york fans we would have beaten them up in buffalo remarkably nothing happened in boston i do n't think it was good manners i think it was and this is sad deference some would say that boston has much to be deferential about mookie wilson 's ground ball through bill buckner 's legs bucky epithet deleted dent the fact that long before the dodgers and the giants left new york for california the braves quit boston for milwaukee and the possibility that the real reason senator edward m kennedy endorsed vice president al gore last week was because bill bradley used to play for new york
