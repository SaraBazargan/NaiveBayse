homecoming in madison is breathtaking this is the pageantry that purists have in mind when they sing the praises of college football droves of students party in fraternity and sorority houses while waves of alumni tailgate and stroll through campus homecoming is an intersection of returning alumni and current students tomorrow the players resume their roles as students wisconsin 's homecoming was spoiled with a 19 14 loss to ohio state a team with a bruising defense and an understated offense that is slowly building a case for itself as the race for the national championship intensifies while the game did n't carry immediate national implications it was vitally important for the big ten ohio state now 8 0 is carrying the banner for a conference that is in danger of being left behind by a national championship oriented industry that judges programs and coaches on whether they can reach the title game now a number of issues are percolating in this normally staid conference the quality of officiating has justifiably come under attack from the dean of coaches and the conference 's top player is contemplating challenging the nfl rule that prohibits freshmen and sophomores from being drafted the controversy over officiating was initiated by penn state 's joe paterno his complaints are leading to a review of officiating and before long may lead to the long overdue use of instant replay at the college level last monday penn state 's director of athletics tim curley asked jim delany the big ten commissioner to conduct a thorough review of officiating procedures in the conference i am of the opinion that big ten officiating has not met the usual high standards associated with the big ten in all areas curley said we have requested that such a review include policies on crew assignments performance evaluation technology accountability recruitment and training of officials heaven knows that paterno has been the beneficiary of bushels of bad calls calls that probably added five years to his career the problem is you 've got a bunch of kids who are busting their butts to win a football game he said they 're working like dogs and i think you owe it to them to make sure the game is won by the players we owe it to the players to make sure the game is played on a level field instant replay will be the first test for myles brand the newly named president and chief executive of the ncaa who says he wants to turn down the volume on big time college football and basketball he wants to make the differences between the colleges and the pros even clearer far from adding distinction however adopting the nfl 's instant replay would pull college football closer to its pro cousin the reality is that for all the joe college nostalgia that homecoming stirs college football is a cold business it 's a business that finances women 's sports and low revenue and nonrevenue sports there is also the maurice clarett issue clarett the gifted tailback rushed for 133 yards yesterday his sixth 100 yard rushing game of the season an ohio state record for freshmen last week he responded to a hypothetical question about his future by saying he might challenge an nfl rule that prohibits freshmen and sophomores from being eligible for the draft the myth all these years is that young football players unlike their peers in every other sport are too immature physically to play in the nfl that 's another myth designed to keep gifted student athletes like clarett down on the nfl farm teams where they can mature and increase the value of big time college programs anyone who has seen clarett for a moment knows he could play in the nfl today but so much of college football is tied up in myths the national championship was determined by myths ohio state and the big ten flourished in an era when sportswriters determined the national champion in some ways for ohio state this game was about remaining a contender for the national championship game in the fiesta bowl with the bowl championship series there is only semi mumbo jumbo computers and the news media voters are gradually being nudged to the sidelines the big ten was at its best when national championships were judged by sleight of hand media influence the big ten was insulated in a world of its own now even the hallowed rose bowl the sole possession of the big ten and pac 10 has been compromised last january we had the spectacle of nebraska and miami converging on pasadena calif to play for the national title so a team like ohio state undefeated though still not really regarded as a true contender must keep winning i have a hard time reconciling the pageantry of college football its implied innocence with the reality of the hard core college football business the southeastern conference office 's annual revenue of 100 million from all sports leads the big ten big 12 and atlantic coast conference but these contradictions are among the things that make college football so entertaining and we 're approaching the best time of the season dress rehearsal is over
