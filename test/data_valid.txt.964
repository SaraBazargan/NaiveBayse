it 's the wealthiest families in america a few thousand who would benefit most from the estate tax repeal for which the republican congress just voted with the support of gov george w bush as well as from the massive income tax cut that mr bush has proposed but is it worth it given the inevitable public backlash over awarding hundreds of billions of dollars to those who need it the least as a republican i ask my party is it worth it to be known increasingly as protector of the rich and powerful despite the appreciative response in campaign contributions the party risks placing itself out of what my uncle nelson rockefeller called the mainstream at the 1964 gop convention when he was the governor of new york and a presidential candidate i watched him issue a warning against extremism in the party you may not like to hear it he told the crowd trying to silence him with boos but it 's the truth today the truth is this it 's out of the mainstream when the republican congress fails to protect patients rights withholds education funding and makes war on the environment it 's out of the mainstream and at odds with true republican principles of fiscal responsibility to plunge back into deficit spending as governor bush has in texas with big tax cuts for the oil industry and others it 's out of the mainstream and at odds with traditional republican standards of liberty to put the federal government between a woman and her doctor in matters of reproductive choice as governor bush and the party would try to do by overturning roe v wade and it 's out of the mainstream and at odds with republican preference for government closest to the people to override local government efforts to limit sprawl and protect drinking water as governor bush did by veto or to side with gun makers against local attempts to hold them accountable for harm done it was far from the american mainstream and at odds with talk of compassion to withhold medical insurance from 200000 children as mr bush did for three years in a state that ranks rock bottom last in family health coverage to try to invade teachers retirement funds to oppose a hate crimes law even after a black man was dragged to death and to allow concealed guns to be carried even into church what a contrast with the record and values of progressive republican governors like new york 's theodore roosevelt nelson rockefeller and yes george pataki so what 's a mainstream republican to do in this year 's elections think hard and act independently larry rockefeller is an environmental lawyer
