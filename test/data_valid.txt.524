first the confession bruce raynor the union leader who helped last week to end the long strike at the museum of modern art has never been to the museum of modern art you probably should n't put that in the paper he says a reporter complains bitterly of course so he smiles and concedes i guess it is too good not to put in right mr raynor is the secretary treasurer of unite the union of needletrades industrial and textile employees one of the largest manufacturing unions in north america he knows a lot about wages and working conditions bargaining and boycotts he could not tell a rauschenberg from a rothko whatever you know about art he says i guarantee you i know less the strikers who held out for more than four months against the museum art professionals with funky eyeglasses and titles like assistant curator are also not exactly the kind of strikers with whom mr raynor is usually involved and the museum is definitely not the kind of management he has come to know and hate over the years here are some more representative examples from his 27 year career as a union organizer the time the shotgun was held on him in andrews sc during his first strike in 1973 the time he was thrown into jail for 10 days in ohio and the jail turned out to be a whole lot nicer and warmer than the motel where he had been staying the time his second marriage dissolved because he was too deeply involved in a labor battle the time he helped lead the final push to unionize the southern textile giant j p stevens the monumental organizing fight upon which the movie norma rae was based mr raynor 50 when asked about what first drew him to the labor movement what caused him to give up a badly needed biochemistry scholarship at cornell university to study labor relations is the kind of guy who is able to say things like this without a trace of post 1960 's irony well to change the world he grew up on long island his father was a truck driver and laborer who died of a heart attack at age 40 while bowling before traveling to south carolina for his first strike mr raynor had never been out of the northeast in fact until he graduated from high school he had never even been as far as new jersey my family did n't have any money so we did n't go on vacation how would you go anywhere i had been to new york i had been to all five boroughs so when he got his first taste of small town still segregated virulently anti union south carolina the reaction was somewhat mutual i had never seen anything like this place in my life he said and they looked at us like we were some kind of creatures from outer space to say there was a lot of hostility is an understatement which meant that mr raynor found himself right at home growing up he explains i was not the biggest guy around i was not a muscle man but i would fight anybody for essentially the next two decades until he moved back to the city two years ago bruce raynor a guy who pronounces law the new york way lawr was a dedicated southerner and despite some obvious limitations he says he loved it i got to know a lot of very courageous people people with very little power who stood up for themselves i would move back in a heartbeat but there were the limitations if someone asks you in a plane or a grocery store or a restaurant 'what do you do and you tell them you 're with a union it ends the conversation it 's like saying 'i 'm a mass murderer i kill people for a living and because both his second wife and the woman to whom he is now married joan a homemaker and part time parents representative at a school are black there were other unspoken rules as well there were some things you did n't do some places you did n't go he says mr raynor and his wife now live in nyack ny where they are raising five children during his time in the south mr raynor was instrumental in helping organize not only j p stevens but also 5200 workers at six fieldcrest cannon plants in kannapolis nc a vote that was considered the largest victory ever for labor in the south when the company 's workers unionized last year going to new york and to larger paperwork responsibilities he is expected to take over the union next year when its president jay mazur resigns seems to have not slowed down mr raynor 's organizing duties in fact the night before the museum of modern art negotiations he had flown the red eye back from las vegas where the union had succeeded in organizing 1600 laundry workers the next night he was on his feet until a museum agreement was reached at 3 am it was a strange role for mr raynor umpiring a game in which he has always been a fiercely partisan player it was even stranger considering that the museum workers had been using the unite cafeteria as a headquarters during the strike but robert batterman the lawyer for the museum said he asked for mr raynor as mediator because he believed he could be fair and this in spite of the conversation mr raynor remembers the two men having just before the talks bob said 'look can i stop by i need to talk to you and i said 'well bob i do n't think you 'd better stop by because the museum workers are here and i ca n't guarantee your safety they might accost you i was really more or less kidding
