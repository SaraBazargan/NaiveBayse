when james e mcgreevey promised to change the way business was done in new jersey 's capital city he probably did n't have this in mind mr mcgreevey rolled to victory in the governor 's race on tuesday after promising voters he would do away with the back room deal making that had long symbolized politics in this state but no sooner had his own victory been declared than fellow democrats who had taken over the state assembly were wrangling over which of them would become its new speaker and republicans and democrats alike were negotiating over how to share the spoils of a state senate that voters had split evenly along party lines for the first time ever suddenly a state government that has enjoyed the stability and clarity of eight years of one party rule finds its officers having to feel their way in an unfamiliar bipartisan world even as they adjust to a new and vastly different balance of power neither mr mcgreevey nor the new legislative leaders will have much time to adapt the state faces an expected budget shortfall ranging from 700 million to twice that amount or more its debt burden has already nearly quadrupled over the last decade as mr mcgreevey never failed to remind the voters that debt makes it difficult if not impossible for him to borrow the extra money he will need and he renewed his commitment not to raise taxes today that leaves only one option reducing government spending which could be enormously unpopular with the labor unions that helped elect mr mcgreevey it 's not a good time to be a state employee to work in social services or in the maintenance of state buildings or at state universities said ross baker a political science professor at rutgers one of those state universities all of these look like they will be in the cross hairs mr baker said that the best possible legislative outcome for mr mcgreevey would have been for the republicans to have kept their hold on the senate one thing about a hostile legislative chamber is that it gives you enormous political cover if you have to do unpopular things he said but democrats picked up just enough seats to force a tie in the senate for the first time since 1937 when a post election vacancy in the much smaller senate of that era produced a 10 10 split that lasted less than a year the senate president also serves as the acting governor when the need arises and the two men who hoped to become senate president outright after tuesday 's election richard j codey of essex county the democratic leader and john o bennett of monmouth county the republican leader presumably have enough personal prestige at stake to seek to recruit members of the opposition several republicans speculated that ronald rice a democratic senator from newark who has had a frosty relationship with leaders in his party would be the most likely defector to their side but mr bennett said talk of turncoats was unrealistic and mr codey called it irresponsible what are they going to offer one of my members mr codey said a first class booking on the titanic mr codey in fact was clinging to hope that a republican senator from the southern tip of the state james cafiero could still wind up being defeated in court where democrats were preparing to challenge absentee ballots but republicans said today that mr cafiero 's margin was enough to survive such a challenge so for now acting gov donald t difrancesco and other officials said they were expecting a senate to take shape in which neither party has control and the trappings of the presidency switch from mr bennett to mr codey on a monthly weekly or even daily basis what that means for governance in a time of crisis is anyone 's guess but mr bennett for one suggested that the pressures to rein in spending and speedily enact antiterror and preparedness measures would serve as needed checks on the natural tendency of politicians to pursue their own agendas at every opening it 's a recipe for good government said mr bennett a moderate republican much like mr difrancesco the real winners in a situation like this are the people of the state of new jersey because in order for a piece of legislation to pass it 's going to have to get republican and democratic support and generally those kinds of issues are the ones that are in the people 's best interests but bipartisanship will require mr mcgreevey to persuade only one opposition member to switch his or her vote at a time others noted everybody 's leverage is better at 20 20 because every day on every vote you 're up for sale one democratic strategist said an administration official similarly recalled an old trenton saying that in the senate every man is a king at 20 20 it has never been more true the official said it 's a lobbyist 's dream besides mr bennett and mr codey the two men whom mr mcgreevey can be expected to turn to most frequently to steer his agenda through the legislature officials said are william l gormley the republican chairman of the senate judiciary committee and senator john lynch a democrat from middlesex county who was president of the senate a decade ago mr lynch who is widely regarded as an astute political strategist did not seek re election but is expected to play a leading role in advising mr mcgreevey mr gormley who has long aspired to the governor 's office himself was the republican who worked most effectively with jim florio the last democrat to occupy the governor 's office
