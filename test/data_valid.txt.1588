like gov jeb bush of florida another guy for whom the presidential election was as much about family loyalty as it was about party loyalty prof bert garskof is not sure how guilty he should feel right now professor garskof a research psychologist at quinnipiac university in hamden conn was an architect of the green party 's national political strategy and ralph nader 's first run for president in 1996 he was a connecticut party leader and remains a registered green he is also senator joseph i lieberman 's brother in law so although he campaigned for the democrats this year even helped organize a last ditch greens for gore effort is n't he at least partly to blame did n't the ragtag pro environment anti free trade movement that he helped channel into organized electoral politics deny mr lieberman the brother of his third wife ellen 50 a clear victory and perhaps the vice presidency professor garskof 67 is not one for what ifs i am not sitting around reflecting on it he said of his role with the formative greens at that time i thought it was the right thing to do and i did it and i played a role in making it happen and if i was back there then i would do it again because i do n't know what i know now i mean would i have married my first wife now no i would n't but if i was brought back there again what would i do then i would marry her again there is in other words regret but not denial and there is the recognition that from almost any perspective but his own he can be viewed as a traitor it is a word he has heard often on election night he and his wife were in nashville at a gore lieberman family dinner watching the returns show mr nader as a potential spoiler in several crucial states enough people knew my history to remind me of it he says wincing 'look at what your old friend is doing they went to bed thinking mr nader had helped the republicans win only to be awakened by banging on the door and screaming in the hallways about the concession that had been taken back and the speech that had been called off in the final days of the campaign professor garskof had given up trying to respond to e mail from greens angered at his efforts for the democrats i got lambasted too many times he said the most piercing message was from a green who skipped the usual name calling and said simply you professor in his own mind there were no loyalties divided professor garskof insists that he had decided not to support mr nader in 2000 long before his brother in law became the democratic vice presidential nominee he made the decision after mr nader declined to run for congress in 1998 from winsted conn mr nader 's hometown mr lieberman he said was pleasantly surprised to get his vote this time around and never sought to convert him he is a listener in those kind of family discussions he said hadassah his wife is much more likely to take me on and talk and go back and forth joe takes it in something about growing old helps radicals see reality he says and a third party was not going to win the presidency unlike ralph professor garskof said i do see a difference between the two parties i always have he was a democrat until 1964 his trust in the party shattered by the vietnam war as a child in manhattan and later in queens he had worshiped franklin d roosevelt who was inaugurated the year he was born political talk in his family often focused on the revolution in russia their native land his grandfather a carpenter instilled in him a hatred of the bolsheviks and a distaste for authoritarian rule in the 1950 's mr garskof working one summer as a camp counselor in chicago threatened anarchy by letting a group of 6  and 7 year olds caucus to discuss and set their own bedtime he still runs his classes in unorthodox fashion often letting students negotiate their grades the 60 's lasted for me through the 80 's he says as a young professor at michigan state university he became involved in antiwar efforts and helped run insurgent political campaigns in 1968 he ran for congress on a peace platform and lost he was fired he moved to quinnipiac in 1971 in 1987 he met ellen lieberman a divorced teacher whose brother was the state attorney general at the time they married in 1989 together they formed dandelion productions a theater company that sends troupes across the country mostly for school age audiences by 1995 bert garskof was a 62 year old hippie in search of a cause there was a lull for me in trying to figure out where i might be able to be useful he says his white eyebrows arching owlishly slender fingers wrapped around a coffee mug in the kitchen of his home here a small reference to the connecticut green party in a local newspaper caught his attention at a meeting in virginia he helped form the association of independent state green parties with groups in 11 states back in connecticut he led the petition drive to put mr nader on the ballot in 1996 that seemed to me to be in this era better than spray painting better than putting up posters at night doing guerrilla theater all the things we used to do but now he believes the more effective strategy would be to create a green coalition under the democratic umbrella i think the greens blew it with this election he said as for his brother in law he added we 're still glued to cnn
