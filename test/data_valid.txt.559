ron howard the director and james horner the composer were huddled behind an enormous control panel overlooking the scoring stage where minutes earlier mr horner had conducted a full orchestra in a climactic sequence from how the grinch stole christmas as the scene played back on a movie screen on the far wall the two men listened intently to the way the lush music worked with the dialogue and the on screen gymnastics of jim carrey it 's kind of a funny tone in there mr howard said what do you think mr horner listened and nodded at issue was whether the soaring music was undercutting the comic aspects of mr carrey 's performance it was a tricky question the movie is based on the classic dr seuss children 's book about a fuzzy green creature who is so bitter that he conspires to ruin everybody 's christmas in whoville the town beneath his mountaintop lair mr carrey plays the grinch in full green regalia including long furry fingers and latex snout but with yellow contact lenses in the scene he bounces around the snow capped cliff like a pinball clutching at his heart if the music is too emphatic and emotional it might drown the comedy but if the music is toned down too much the scene might not give the audience the emotional catharsis it wants from the climax it 's like being a tightrope walker with one foot in the air at all times mr horner said my feeling is that the funniness is going to come through whatever so i tend to err on the side of making things emotive the scoring stage is about the size of a basketball court strewn with instruments awaiting the afternoon session a gaily decorated christmas tree stands in one corner and brightly wrapped packages are scattered around the room mr horner 's crew members often decorate the stage to match the film on which they are working for the perfect storm the same stage had been festooned with ships and plastic frogmen the score the computer effects and the final sound mix are always the last pieces to be put into place in the weeks before a movie 's release in this case mr horner and his musicians are working with a little time to spare grinch is not due in theaters until nov 17 vying with films like 102 dalmatians rugrats in paris and the new adam sandler comedy little nicky for the lucrative thanksgiving market during the lunch break mr horner walked through the crowded scoring stage picking his way through the tangle of cellos and electronic synthesizers to a line of oddly twisted plastic hoses resting on the floor each of the peculiar objects was a musical instrument created by mr horner 's team to make the kind of odd sounds that might come from the baroque meets dali instruments drawn by dr seuss for his whoville town band he picked one up and energetically blew into it producing a vibrating honk that sounded at once plaintive and hostile we had one that had a slide on it like a trombone but it took two people to work it mr horner said one of the most prolific movie composers of the last quarter century mr horner has worked on more than 100 film and television scores though he is perhaps best known for his oscar winning work on titanic he won for best score and best song my heart will go on mr horner said he usually took about six weeks to write the initial score i do it at a desk with pen and paper he said i do n't use a computer in writing at all i 'm sort of old fashioned about it in a way the public aspect of his job when he must stand up before a room filled with seasoned musicians explain what he wants and then conduct them through it is the most uncomfortable i tend to be a shy person he said he does not for instance go to the premieres of his films when he must walk a red carpet gantlet of television cameras unless he is forced to attend mr horner wandered into a side office to work on that afternoon 's pieces of the score he is feeling pretty confident about the way things are going on the grinch score when it makes me cry then i know i 've nailed it he said i ca n't do any better joys of summer michael tollin was excited he was preparing to direct the final scene for summer catch a romance between a poor boy freddie prinze jr and a rich girl jessica biel set in the world of the cape cod summer baseball league and ken griffey jr center fielder for the cincinnati reds was going to be playing a key role it 's a pivotal scene mr tollin said we needed a guy who really transcended the sport who was more recognizable than the average baseball player and junior said he was up for it the scene is a confrontation between him and freddie 's character and there is some scripted dialogue and some chances for him to do some ad libbing i think he 's really got the chops mr tollin a producer for live action programs on the nickelodeon network directed his first film hank aaron chasing the dream in 1995 indeed he has shown a decided inclination toward the national pastime in addition to directing summer catch tentatively scheduled for release next spring he is producing hardball another movie for release next year that is about a young man in the chicago projects who becomes a little league coach i 've always enjoyed working with professional athletes he said stunt casting call it whatever you want for 'summer catch i got hank aaron to come down and do a cameo carlton fisk plays himself richie allen plays a scout
