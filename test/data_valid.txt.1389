tyler brule who for six high flying years was the editor of wallpaper magazine must be a hard man to shop for as one of the world 's most finicky arbiters of midcentury modern style he knows and has what he likes among the accouterments the 33 year old has amassed are his own private island off the coast of sweden which came with a malevolent swan he has yet to face down an apartment in zurich another in st moritz and an audi a4 station wagon the better to haul home pricey furnishings so it might seem almost perverse that the newest object of mr brule 's affection should be such a minor one costing 15 to 25 depending on the model the zyliss hand held food chopper from switzerland is not a triumph of avant garde design nor is it the latest appliance in the deluxe kitchen pantheon designed to sit next to the kitchenaid mixer and the dualit toaster and incite envy among guests its appeal is its humbleness there 's only one piece mr brule said so it is n't some big production to put together and after you 're done you just run it under water or throw it in the dishwasher it cuts five minutes out of the cooking process mr brule who vacated his magazine post last month is in switzerland because his latest project for wink media the advertising and design agency he ran alongside wallpaper is redesigning swissair now swiss international air lines swiss for short inside and out from the cutlery to the paint job introduced to the chopper by a friend who used to be a cook in the swedish navy and who smuggled it aboard his ship because it was unapproved equipment mr brule was seduced by the little gadget with rotating blades when he saw people in switzerland using it as a basic kitchen tool to mince an onion here some parsley there or to chop fruits and nuts for the morning muesli the swiss have a word for it schnick schnack he said the expression it seems refers to any needless embellishments he explained when you just want something plain and basic like when you want a good massage without all the ayurvedic nonsense you say i just want a massage no schnick schnack the zyliss chopper is totally that it 's an amazing piece of democratic design zyliss a company founded in the 1950 's has made inroads in the united states in the last 10 years with such schnick schnack free items as a salad spinner and a garlic press which blessedly works without one 's having to peel the garlic but the chopper has yet to enchant the american public mr brule said he knew why americans who are into food like to think of themselves as purists going down that cuisinart moulinex route he mused this looks like something that you 'd buy off the television that k tel should have bought the rights to yet it seems that mr brule is something of a purist himself i 'd hate it if zyliss went down the infomercial road to promote this in the us he said that would kind of ruin it for me
