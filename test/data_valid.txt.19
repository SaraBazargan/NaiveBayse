the space shuttle endeavour is to lift off on thursday on a 12 day mission to deliver a new crew to the international space station and install critical components of the station 's 600 million robotic arm citing security after sept 11 the national aeronautics and space administration withheld the liftoff time 7 44 pm until late this afternoon stormy weather could keep the shuttle grounded until next week the astronauts are to deliver and install a mobile work platform for the robotic arm a cranelike device essential to the assembly of the station the aluminum platform which is the size and shape of the chassis of a small bus is an important part of a minirailroad that carries the arm and astronauts back and forth across the station the astronauts are also to perform wrist surgery on the canadian built arm in an operation that officials say is critical to completing the girderlike central truss assembly of the truss which will be as long as a football field began last month and may be delayed if the astronauts do not replace a faulty joint on the arm the new space station crew two russians and an american is the fifth since it opened in november 2000 the members who are to stay 135 days are col valery g korzun 49 of the russian air force sergei y treschev 43 a civilian astronaut for a russian aerospace company rsc energia and dr peggy a whitson 42 a nasa astronaut endeavour will carry back col yuri i onufrienko 40 of the russian air force col carl e walz 46 of the united states air force and capt daniel w bursch 44 of the navy who have been in space since dec 5 the robotic arm has seven wrist elbow and shoulder joints that let it be manipulated like a human arm problems with one of the three wrist joints began in march engineers said they thought that an electrical short was causing it to seize up when computer commands were sent along data transmission lines prompting the crane to shut down the joint works properly when commands are transmitted over secondary lines but managers decided to replace the defective part and return it to earth for analysis the seven hour operation will be performed on one of three spacewalks planned for the mission the plan calls for astronauts to remove the arm 's snarelike hand called an end effector before replacing the flawed wrist joint dr franklin r chang diaz 52 a nasa astronaut who will be making his seventh shuttle flight will carry out the work along with col philippe perrin 39 of the french air force when you look at it it looks like major surgery because we take the end of the arm off and then swap the joints and then get the end effector back in place colonel perrin said it 's going to be a long spacewalk but i think it will be quite simple the surgery will follow the installation of the arm 's mobile base system built by md robotics inc of brampton ontario the 254 million work platform will enable the arm to carry loads up to 46000 pounds across rail tracks atop the central truss without the platform the truss can not be completed the first segment of the girder a 44 foot aluminum latticework equipped with a cartlike transporter and a section of rail track was mounted on the destiny science module on a shuttle mission last month dr whitson and colonel korzun will use canadarm2 to remove the 3307 pound platform from the cargo bay of the shuttle and put it on the rail transporter in july canadarm2 which can creep end over end like an inchworm will be moved to the mobile base from an anchor outside the destiny laboratory the crane will be positioned to hoist and install two truss segments to be flown to the station later over the next 16 months the rest of the girder will be erected stretching 356 feet the finished truss will provide mounting points for four giant solar power arrays heat radiators and japanese and european research equipment in the first two spacewalks dr chang diaz and colonel perrin will prepare the work platform for installation and will stow six shields against micrometeoroid debris outside the station designed to protect the hull of the russian built crew quarters the bulletproof panels are to be installed by the new crew the endeavour astronauts also will unload supplies and 3500 pounds of research gear kenneth d cockrell 52 a civilian nasa astronaut and a veteran of four flights will be mission commander the pilot lt col paul s lockhart 44 of the air force will be on his first flight colonel perrin colonel treschev and dr whitson also are first time space fliers colonel korzun is a veteran astronaut the endeavour is to return to the kennedy space center on june 11
