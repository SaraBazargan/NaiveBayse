to the editor as one who remembers world war ii as though it were yesterday as a combat veteran of the korean war as a retired journalist and a father i tell you that no story pierced so deeply as the death of pvt kelly prewitt in iraq front page may 10 the random fury of a firefight the survivable wound the selfless heroism of a few at terrible risk and their triumph of rescue followed by the relentless melting away of life the shock of death 's victory and the haunting memories that will live forever and lastly the indescribable grief that sears hearts just beyond our vision how suddenly real for us now is kelly prewitt and the men who offered everything to save him and also somewhere in silence his family ernie pyle knew that the small story made us all part of the big war it still is true war belongs to all even those who stand and wait james j mcmanus madison ga may 11 2003
