the philadelphia eagles arrived at ericsson stadium on sunday in search of further confirmation that they are the dominant team in the national football conference after a 25 16 victory over the carolina panthers their first over a division leader perhaps only st louis can now argue the point the eagles 9 3 have won seven games in a row and 9 of 10 since losing the first two of the season but unlike the dallas cowboys who shed tears of joy when they beat the nfc south leading panthers a week ago the eagles were hardly puffy eyed after this one was over there 's no time to go wild philadelphia quarterback donovan mcnabb said you only go wild in february it 's all about winning and moving on particularly when the eagles move on to their most important game of the season a rematch with the cowboys 8 4 next sunday in philadelphia the eagles lost to dallas 23 21 on oct 12 back when mcnabb 's capabilities were being questioned but there was little question about his performance against the panthers on sunday at least after the opening minutes mcnabb 's streak of 127 passes without an interception ended on the first play of the game when a tipped ball was picked off by carolina defensive end mike rucker that led to a 20 yard field goal by the panthers john kasay and an early 3 0 lead mcnabb 's and kasay 's games went in opposite directions after that and so went the fortunes of the eagles and the panthers 8 4 mcnabb was an efficient 18 of 26 for 182 yards his 10 yard touchdown throw to james thrash early in the fourth quarter gave the eagles a 22 10 lead as for kasay he missed three field goals and an extra point in one of the worst performances of his career his misses were from 32 38 and 49 yards it was the first time since 1998 that kasay a 13 year veteran had missed a field goal from less than 40 yards consider that in 1999 kasay missed three field goals all season as for the missed extra point it was his first since 2001 that accounted for 10 points in a game the panthers lost by 9 i try to take the good with the bad said kasay who was 20 for 20 on field goal attempts in the first nine games this season this is one of the days you do n't dream about and you do n't want to have happen but it does sometimes you know the sun 's going to come up tomorrow and i 'll have an opportunity to work on this and i 'll try to improve meanwhile eagles kicker david akers was 4 for 4 on field goals including three in the second half from 48 38 and 29 yards as the eagles slowly pulled away john 's a friend of mine said akers who was cut by the panthers in 1997 when the incumbent kasay won the job in training camp he 's like a mentor to me he was kicking at a pro bowl level all pro level for that matter i would have taken him over any kicker coming into today 's game in the league the panthers were not about to blame kasay carolina had trouble stopping the triple threat running game of brian westbrook correll buckhalter and duce staley who combined for 118 yards and a touchdown staley scored on a 2 yard run in the first quarter when the eagles erased the panthers 3 0 lead westbrook had 12 carries for 64 yards and 5 catches for 32 yards buckhalter added 30 yards on 6 carries late in the third quarter the panthers closed to 13 10 with a 24 yard touchdown pass from jake delhomme to steve smith but mcnabb led the eagles to 12 fourth quarter points in addition to the touchdown throw to thrash mcnabb sealed the victory on a third down play late in the fourth quarter with a 29 yard strike to tight end chad lewis that allowed akers to kick his fourth field goal giving the eagles the final margin the panthers despite a 115 yard rushing game by stephen davis and two touchdown throws by delhomme could not find their way into the end zone often enough that was why they were forced to go to kasay in the first place it was the second loss in a row for the panthers who still have a cushion in the nfc south but have lost much of the momentum from their 5 0 start i do n't think anything 's slipping away delhomme said adding i do n't think it 's time to panic
