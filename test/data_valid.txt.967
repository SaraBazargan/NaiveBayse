i 've been thoroughly frustrated for the last couple of years trying to find a good moderately priced greek seafood restaurant certainly plenty of mediocre examples are around clustered in astoria queens and dotting the streets of manhattan where they were briefly in vogue in the mid 1990 's but except for a couple of good ones like meltemi and rafina on the upper east side they have been invariably disappointing almost always it 's the same problem these restaurants overcook the fish why this happens is beyond my comprehension few things are as elemental and easy to enjoy as greek seafood particularly in warmer weather you do n't need a chemistry degree to understand the formula of simple ingredients fresh fish olive oil herbs and lemon juice simply prepared on a charcoal grill yet nothing shatters the greek island fantasy of pastel colors and cool breezes rippling in off sunny shores like overdone tasteless fish enter syros which opened four months ago in astoria and is named after the greek island on which the owner theodore menis grew up i had heard glowing reports about syros but having been disappointed too many times i kept my expectations in check syros is attractive enough in a conventional kind of way it has the usual open kitchen and display cases of fish and meat with a glass ceiling the main dining room in the rear is warm and bright on sunny days and glows with candlelight at night the room is the typical blue and white decorated with fishing artifacts and murals of island scenes on my first visit we began with a selection of dips now i am inclined to like greek dips but these were particularly good melitzanes salata 425 or pureed eggplant dip was delightfully vinegary while taramosalata 395 a fish roe puree was bracing and pungent the skordalia 325 which is little more than pureed potatoes imbued with garlic was powerful but not overpowering while tzatziki 395 a blend of yogurt garlic cucumbers and dill was perfectly refreshing the dips were served with a loaf of fresh warm italian bread and a dish of little olives i confess that i was beginning to get excited as i waited for the fish and soon i was rewarded syros 's grilled fish was superb perfectly cooked moist and delicious i had ordered grilled porgy 16 one of my favorite fishes which are usually small round and bony this one was unexpectedly large but was still tender full of the fragile flavor that is so easily lost beautifully seasoned with no more than salt oregano lemon juice and olive oil grilled shrimp 1475 big and butterflied were likewise cooked just enough to release their delicate shrimpy flavor main courses come with sides like lemon roasted potatoes a standard that is surprisingly good here rice and dandelion greens which are oily and not so good i 've been back to syros several times now and enjoyed carefully cooked striped bass 17 fine salmon steak 1350 and good grilled sardines 995 spanakopita 450 crisp layers of phyllo encasing spinach and feta cheese was fresh and savory while saganaki 675 fried kasseri cheese was nutty and rich lemony fish soup 450 was excellent and even a t bone steak 1525 was beefy and winning and yet on my last visit the red snapper 18 was overcooked this was an exception i like to think and grilled octopus 950 in a red wine vinaigrette had a dull tired air another exception i hope syros offers so much to like including its friendly helpful waiters and a reasonably priced list of mostly greek wines yet i 'm conditioned to worry for seafood perfection is fleeting syros has captured it i just hope the restaurant wo n't let it go syros 32 11 broadway astoria queens 718 278 1877 best dishes eggplant puree fish roe puree potato garlic puree tzatziki grilled porgy grilled shrimp grilled striped bass grilled sardines spinach pie fried cheese fish soup t bone steak price range appetizers 395 to 1025 main courses 925 to 22 credit cards all major cards hours sunday through thursday 11 am to midnight friday and saturday to 1 am wheelchair access restrooms are downstairs
