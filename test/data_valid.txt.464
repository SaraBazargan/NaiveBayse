to the editor re bush on wall st offers tough stance front page july 10 in recent years executive compensation in the tens of millions of dollars has been tied to good stock and earnings performance and that is wrong for two reasons first executives are supposed to produce good earnings this is what they are there for and it does n't merit mega compensation second since in many corporations bonuses and stock options are usually tied to stock performance which in turn is tied to increasing earnings there is a tremendous incentive for executives to massage earnings and deceive accountants so that they can cash out and leave with mega fortunes apres moi le deluge seems to be the operative executive philosophy these compensation arrangements are perfectly legal but they are unethical and outrageous herbert rosenberg dobbs ferry ny july 10 2002
