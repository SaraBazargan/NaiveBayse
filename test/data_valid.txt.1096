it is a reality of modern campaigns that contests for important offices often become struggles for publicity and candidates are driven to find ways to use their existing public positions to increase their favorable exposure to voters so there was nothing particularly surprising or for that matter offensive about mayor rudolph giuliani 's high profile during the televised new year 's eve festivities in times square or about the white house 's decision to have hillary rodham clinton join president clinton in delivering a televised greeting to the nation from the oval office on new year 's day but as a matter of government ethics electoral fairness and simple good taste some things ought to remain out of bounds we include in this category mr giuliani 's new tactic of using the city 's tourism agency nyc company to finance promotional radio ads featuring his voice in new york city and upstate areas sure to be a prime battleground in the senate race we also refer to mrs clinton 's apparent determination to introduce the soft money abuses pioneered by mr clinton 's 1996 re election campaign as a regular feature of new york politics mayor giuliani has done ads promoting city tourism for the past four years but this is the first time they are to be broadcast upstate a 1998 law passed by the city council and signed by mr giuliani bans candidates for city office from promoting themselves with city funds in an election year regrettably though the ban does not cover candidates for federal office the council needs to plug this loophole meanwhile the city 's winter tourism campaign should continue but without mr giuliani as the on the air talent mrs clinton for her part seems intent on evading federal limits on a candidate 's fund raising by channeling huge chunks of unregulated soft money to a special victory fund set up by the democratic party to help pay for a portion of her television ads the washington post reported that mrs clinton had raised in excess of 360000 for this fund and attended 11 fund raisers designed to garner soft money also last october the democratic senate campaign committee received a whopping 500000 contribution from new york 's largest health care union this eager collection of soft money continued as mrs clinton was being criticized for allowing the new york state democratic party to run television spots promoting her senate candidacy the 338000 ad campaign was financed mostly by soft money contributions including large gifts that would have been barred under federal law had they been given directly to the clinton campaign it was the republicans who started the use of such state level committees but so far mr giuliani has refrained from joining the soft money fund raising race mrs clinton should forswear soft money and challenge the mayor to do the same and he should order nyc company to quit running taxpayer financed ads designed to help him politically
