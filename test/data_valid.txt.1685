like smoke rising from a small brush fire the chant began in the southeast corner of the lower stands at giants stadium late in the third quarter yesterday with the atlanta falcons leading 20 7 fi re fassel the voices demanded fi re fassel boos were also heard every so often in the giants lazy 27 7 loss but strangely the chant was never heard again maybe because not enough of the 78813 spectators stayed around to form a choir but jim fassel heard the chant and understood it even if he did not expect it i can understand the fans being upset i am upset i do n't like it fassel the giants coach said sharply when asked about the chant i knew that was what i was going to get when i came here if i did n't do well that is just the nature of the beast if you do n't like it if it is too hard for you to handle then do n't ever come here and do n't coach this team ever ok but if the giants now 4 5 lose their next two games at philadelphia and at tampa bay before returning against buffalo and washington those voices will be heard again the brush fire could grow into a wildfire sooner or later the chant always gets its man four decades ago giants fans chanted goodbye allie the beginning of the end for allie sherman jets fans chanted joe must go and joe walton went now the fi re fassel chant has begun and unless the giants somehow salvage this season by qualifying for the playoffs the chant may doom him too more and more you hear the question what do you think of fassel the answer here is that he 's a better coach than most of the current national football league sideline savants but he has never shown that he could develop into a great coach he pushed and prodded the giants into the playoffs three times in his previous six seasons but they lost in the first round twice and won the national football conference title once only to be embarrassed 34 7 by the baltimore ravens in super bowl xxxv with only next season remaining on his four year 1075 million contract a 7 9 or an 8 8 finish this season could finish him the chant was understandable these giants touted as a super bowl contender did n't just lose ugly yesterday they lost without honor they had been warned by fassel that the falcons who had lost seven straight after winning their opener represented what coaches call a trap game but in pro football it 's a trap game only if your players let it be a trap game and these giants like the beatles let it be let it be these giants did n't just embarrass themselves their coach and their fans these giants also embarrassed at least two of the giants glorious icons of other eras frank gifford and harry carson gifford the hall of fame halfback from the glory teams of the late 50 's and early 60 's summed up the giants performance with one word bottom carson the linebacker who should be in the hall of fame said it was the giants worst effort since the sorry teams of the late 70 's before george young arrived as general manager before phil simms and lawrence taylor arrived before bill parcells arrived as coach before the two super bowl triumphs this is the first time a team has beaten the giants in the last two years the other losses they beat themselves carson who appears on the giants local pregame show said i thought the san francisco playoff game would 've shaken them up but i guess not you ca n't turn that switch on when the game starts after the giants wasted a 38 14 lead in that 39 38 season ending loss fassel talked about how he wanted the players to remember the taste of that defeat when the giants opened this season with a 23 13 victory over the st louis rams it appeared they had remembered but since then the giants have dropped four games before their home crowd to the dallas cowboys the miami dolphins the philadelphia eagles and now the atlanta falcons whose defense had been riddled for an average of 328 points a game in seven straight losses against that falcons defense the giants scored 7 points on dorsey levens 's 2 yard run halfway through the second quarter the giants defense let warrick dunn rush for 178 yards the third string quarterback kurt kittner in the absence of michael vick completed only 9 of 23 passes for 65 yards but one was a 4 yard touchdown to justin griffith in the locker room defensive end michael strahan and running back tiki barber stood up for fassel and his staff strahan scolded the fans for the chant and the boos saying if you 're here to encourage us encourage but it only takes a few to chant barber told that fassel had agreed that the giants had not played hard said that says that we as players need a gut check this has nothing to do with coach fassel it has to do with us in recent weeks fassel 's battle cry has been that the giants have to dig themselves out of a hole one shovel at a time when cornerback will allen was reminded of fassel 's motto and what the giants had to do now he said we need two shovels but even two shovels may not be enough to silence the chant now that it has begun
