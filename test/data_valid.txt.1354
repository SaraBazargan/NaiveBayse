the road to home my life and times by vartan gregorian illustrated 354 pp new york simon schuster 2995 vartan gregorian has had an enviably diverse and distinguished career born in 1934 to a poor family of christian armenians in tabriz iran he managed to overcome the resistance of his demanding and conservative father to study history at beirut and then miraculously it seemed at stanford from then on almost nobody could stop him he taught at major american universities worked his way up to the powerful post of provost at the university of pennsylvania only to be brutally even treacherously passed up for its presidency his single real disappointment though a stinging one served from 1981 to 1988 as president of the new york public library went on to be appointed president of brown university and since 1997 has been president of the carnegie corporation after decades of asking for money he has reached the desirable point of giving it away yet for all these resounding titles all the academic honors and influential friends he has garnered he has not lost his capacity for astonishment at the triumphant course of his life with exemplary honesty and touching candor he records his incredulousness at being singled out for eminent positions when he gets a call inviting him to fly out to meet with the chairman of the search committee selecting a new chancellor of the university of california berkeley he is he tell us thunderstruck nor can he get over meeting all those new york social celebrities in his awe at the festive dinner that brooke astor the legendary philanthropist with whom of course it was love at first sight gives in his honor upon his being appointed president of the new york public library he provides in a long footnote a list of the guests complete with their honorifics in serene retrospect reflecting in a postscript on his long voyage he muses still half disbelieving it from tabriz iran to new york city by way of lebanon california texas pennsylvania rhode island and numerous other places in between a poor boy yearning for knowledge who i hope became an educated man now at the helm of an organization dedicated to disseminating knowledge to all the world a dreamer who learned to take action a wandering armenian who ended up on the society pages of the new york times this he adds is the life i could never have expected the life it has been my privilege to lead it is as though he has become an overachiever endowed with extraordinary ever renewed energy to prove to his father that his unquenchable campaign for learning and largely disinterested power has not been a waste among gregorian 's posts his seven year presidency of the new york public library stands out as most spectacular and the one most likely to endure my opinion may not be altogether unbiased but the record bears me out old timers will remember and gregorian reminds his readers with some depressing details that before he assumed the presidency the library and its branches were in sorry shape he quotes liberally and pointedly from outsider insider the autobiography of andrew heiskell chairman of the library 's board of trustees with whom gregorian would form a close harmonious working alliance the library was broke the chandeliers and lighting fixtures all through the main building were dirty and had only two or three bulbs in each the beautiful celeste bartos forum now the library 's most important meeting place had been turned into a warehouse the gorgeous gottesman exhibition hall had been divided by masonite partitions into tiny offices for personnel and accounting the only decent room in the entire building was the boardroom but even there the tall curtains fell apart if you touched them precious volumes were literally disintegrating cataloging was painfully behind schedule hours of service were shockingly few the morale of the professional library staff valiantly working against heavy odds was at its nadir yet bad as that was gregorian recalls the conditions at the main research library appeared idyllic in comparison to the plight of the 83 branch libraries throughout manhattan bronx and staten island buildings some of them donated by andrew carnegie as a gift to the city of new york were crumbling their collections dwindling what made the situation of the library almost hopeless was as gregorian frankly reports that donors were reluctant the board of trustees weak and the city government callously indifferent the new president 's task was to put it mildly daunting he set about it with techniques honed in earlier positions though techniques falsely implies a certain calculation on gregorian 's part actually he worked as he did because it was natural to him he acquainted himself with the state of the library from its staff to its relation to the city of new york he labored successfully to improve the librarians working conditions he sought the acquaintance of philanthropists and almost naively tried to infect them with his optimism selling hope that he had to persuade himself he felt he ran an open administration talking to everyone and winning over his skeptical staff and he showed himself keenly aware of the side effects that physical appearance can have on productivity and potential donors he promptly engaged the services of the gifted and humane architect lewis davis whom he had known at penn and who more than a dozen years after gregorian 's departure continues to beautify the library this physical rehabilitation is a living highly visible legacy to a new york treasure that all too many visitors simply take for granted vartan gregorian is not a subtle stylist sly ironist or probing searcher into human nature his favorite adjective is great and the tasks he feels compelled to undertake are all challenges but such literary limitations actually work in his favor for they permit his readers to trust him what you see is what you get and what you get is the full account of a worthwhile life that has rewarded thousands of students and more thousands of readers if the word had not been so badly debased in our time i would call him a civilian hero peter gay the author most recently of savage reprisals is at work on a study of modernism
