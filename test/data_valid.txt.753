fans wanted it the news media wanted it and tiger woods and phil mickelson wanted it welcome to tiger versus lefty nike versus titleist no 1 in the world versus no 3 woods and mickelson will be in sunday 's final threesome at the buick invitational giving the two a chance to have the last word at least for one day february golf tournaments are not expected to be this intense but the climax on sunday will have a special buzz woods in his first tournament since having knee surgery in december will start the final round with a one stroke lead putting himself back on center stage the star returning to command top billing mickelson is no stranger to the spotlight but his recent comments have drawn more attention than his accomplishments mickelson has been a magnet for controversy since saying that woods is the only player good enough to overcome the equipment he 's stuck with mickelson plays titleist equipment while woods plays nike equipment and mickelson 's comments lit a match in the golf community mickelson apologized to woods on wednesday and woods accepted saying that mickelson made a flip comment that did not come off well but neither player has forgotten nor have executives from either company how fitting then that mickelson and woods will go head to head sunday settling matters at torrey pines golf course which they love and where they have won before after shooting a 68 today woods stood at 12 under par for the tournament one stroke ahead of brad faxon 71 and two ahead of mickelson 69 and steven alker 70 five players were tied at nine under fred couples briny baird jonathan kaye arron oberholser and carl pettersson but the gallery and the television audience will be focused on the final threesome woods mickelson and faxon i love the challenge of it said mickelson whose 18 foot putt for birdie at no 18 secured his place in the final group i thought it would be fun to play with tiger he 's probably not even 100 percent he has n't played competitively for some time and yet he 's still leading the tournament it shows you what a great player he is woods is also a great closer in 28 pga tour events in which he has held or shared the lead after three rounds he was won 26 times but the last player to defeat woods when he held a final round lead was mickelson who overtook him to win the 2000 tour championship think woods remembers that he also remembers the 2000 buick invitational he entered the tournament having won his previous six starts but mickelson prevailed to bring his streak to a halt in major championships woods has been dominant winning eight mickelson has yet to win one mickelson grew up near torrey pines and he has won three times on the course 1993 2000 and 2001 while woods has won once 1999 woods said he did not expect it to be easy if you were to pick two guys to play well on this course i think you would probably pick us two woods said but i ca n't just worry about phil there are a lot of guys right behind us if we do n't go out there and play well we will get passed but it 's going to be exciting did mickelson think being the last player to overtake woods would help him you could look at it that way or you could say it 's been two and a half years since anybody has reeled him in mickelson said already woods 's comeback has gone better than he expected his knee has held up even after 27 holes on friday and he is in position to win despite not hitting the ball as crisply as he can as usual woods found a way to make birdies today and he also escaped trouble he made crucial putts to save par at nos 12 13 and 14 he made a terrific pitch shot at no 18 to set up a birdie that gave him the lead and his shot of the day was a 3 wood out of a fairway bunker at no 6 that carried to the green 260 yards away to set up a birdie how many players hit 3 wood shots from fairway bunkers and carry 260 yards i hit it solid woods said smiling despite playing his first tournament since his operation he has not held back he has tried every shot he has needed and he has not been hindered by his knee that is very very positive news woods said i 'm going out there and giving it everything i 've got and nothing has happened despite the attention that woods and mickelson will command they have sometimes not played their best when in the same group if that happens again faxon a seven time winner on the tour is in the best position to capitalize i 'm going to kind of get lost in the shuffle faxon said it 's going to be mayhem out there i hope i will have a little crowd myself to win with those two in the last group would be as big as i could do but woods is still woods mickelson is a master at torrey pines and they figure to add a chapter to their rivalry mickelson believes he can beat woods but he has lost to him enough to know that it will take superb golf and that was why mickelson was eager for the round to begin this tournament is special to me and to this community and to have myself and tiger in the final group is special mickelson said it 's hard beating the best player in the world and he does n't make many mistakes but that 's a challenge i 'm looking forward to
