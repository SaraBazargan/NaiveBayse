a river barge crashed into an interstate highway bridge about 65 miles southeast of tulsa okla early yesterday collapsing a 600 foot long section of the four lane highway and sending as many as nine cars and trucks tumbling into the arkansas river the authorities said three bodies were recovered late last night but the officials said they did not know how many others remained underwater the accident occurred shortly before 8 am when the barge struck one of the concrete pilings supporting the 2000 foot long bridge on interstate 40 in webbers falls said rebecca smith a spokeswoman for muskogee county emergency medical services a minute or so later part of the bridge collapsed into the river as horrified boaters and fishermen watched ms smith said the cause of the accident was unclear yesterday but crew members on the tugboat that was pulling the 495 foot barge recalled seeing the pilot black out and fall to the deck shortly before the crash said gov frank keating who spoke yesterday afternoon near the site witnesses said several cars plummeted 60 feet to the fast running river as the bridge gave way beneath them but others vehicles including at least two tractor trailers and a horse trailer careened off the precipice afterward unable to stop in time some drivers could not see the gap ahead because it was on the side of the bridge 's crest opposite them witnesses said a few victims were rescued by boaters who saw the collapse and rushed to help but others apparently could not escape from their sinking cars ms smith said i saw three semis go in said fred benton who was camping on the shore at the time and was in one of the first boats to reach the site where the barge was still lodged with huge concrete slabs from the bridge sitting on top of it the bodies of two women and a man along with three vehicles had been pulled from the river by last night officials said rescue operations were suspended at 7 45 pm and would resume at daylight today they said several hundred emergency vehicles clogged the area around the bridge yesterday as cranes struggled to stabilize the barge and divers tried unsuccessfully to recover bodies on the river rescue workers gathered floating car seats children 's clothing and other debris from the sunken cars the barge one of two being pushed by the same boat had just dropped off a load of asphalt and was headed north said officials at the oklahoma highway patrol it struck the bridge near its western edge far from the marked channel which runs through the middle of the bridge 's span officials said last night shane guthrie a personnel manager for the magnolia marine transport company in vicksburg miss told the associated press the company 's tugboat was pushing the two barges when the accident took place none of the seven people who were on the barge were injured mr guthrie said the pilot who was identified by the authorities as joe dedmon of florence miss was being treated at hospital in muskogee a few miles away governor keating said joel henderson a spokesman for magnolia marine said mr dedmon had been a tugboat pilot for about 30 years and was very familiar with these waters it 's our understanding that he blacked out and then came to after the contact mr henderson said the national transportation safety board was sending a team to investigate the accident governor keating said state transportation officials were checking the bridge 's construction to see if it contributed to the collapse said terri angier a spokeswoman for the oklahoma transportation department the bridge was built in 1967 and last was inspected in 2001 said ms angier when it was inspected it was in great shape no problem she said divers from a local fire department and the oklahoma lake patrol tried to rescue people trapped underwater yesterday afternoon but were delayed by the instability of the barge and the collapsed bridge section ms smith said there is lots of debris and fast water there 's no visibility said doug mclaughlin a volunteer firefighter working as a diver the cars and trucks were submerged in 11 feet of water officials at the scene said wanda morgan who lives less than a mile from the bridge said she and her husband rushed out of their house after they heard what sounded like an explosion shortly before 8 am i saw two cars go off the bridge she said they were there and then they just went off and there was a big splash of water one survivor bleeding from the head and chest was wandering near the shore after a boater dropped him off ms morgan said he did n't even know how he got out of the river she said several fishermen who were taking part in a bass fishing tournament on the river helped gather suitcases clothing candy wrappers and other debris that was drifting in the water shortly afterward all kinds of people tried to help said mr benton the camper then i saw a baby shoe and i just quit looking four survivors were in stable condition yesterday at the muskogee regional medical center about 20 miles away said ken laubenstein a hospital spokesman interstate 40 is the major highway running east west through oklahoma the bridge about 35 miles west of the arkansas border typically carries 20000 vehicles a day governor keating said one or two barges pass under the bridge a day transporting about 4 million tons of cargo a year he added it is a major thoroughfare across the united states and having it down is not good news for commerce he said
