to the editor re your doctor 's drug problem by arnold s relman op ed nov 18 my own experience as a physician before my recent retirement was quite different the physician experts who came to wausau wis to speak about drugs were often well known academic researchers and clinicians they would invariably thank the drug company that sponsored their visit describe their own relationship with that company if any and then give well balanced clinically useful presentations discussions of new drugs are useful clinically only if they include information comparing the mechanism of action effectiveness cost and side effects of the new and older drugs the best presenters did this very well and often added information about drugs in the development process that might be marketed in the near future the fact that xyz drug company bought the meal did n't detract from the credibility of these speakers i doubt that this system of education is a primary factor in rising drug costs charles f maccarthy md wausau wis nov 18 2003
