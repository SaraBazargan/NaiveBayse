the portland trail blazers squandered a 10 point halftime lead and lost the opening game of their nba playoff series because of their failure to stop dallas power forward dirk nowitzki in the mavericks 96 86 victory tonight nowitzki scored a career high 46 points portland attempted to stop him by using five different defenders at points in the game none of it mattered though as nowitzki the shaggy haired german hit an array of 3 pointers fadeaway jump shots and flailing layups he made 16 of 27 field goals and 10 of 11 free throws dirk carried us dallas coach don nelson said that 's what you call putting a team on your back the blazers began the game with their own star power forward rasheed wallace guarding nowitzki from there they shuffled bonzi wells zach randolph ruben patterson and scottie pippen against him none of it seemed to matter though portland coach maurice cheeks said that because a majority of nowitzki 's shots came from the perimeter and off pick and rolls the blazers were unable to double team him despite the blistering performance cheeks said he did not plan to double team nowitzki for the rest of the series he 's a pretty good basketball player cheeks said we just need to deny him the ball and keep it out of his hands nelson gushed considerably more about nowitzki a 7 foot forward who is in his fourth nba season he said that nowitzki 's game was still just evolving and that one day he would be able to use nowitzki at point guard nelson also said that nowitzki 's diverse skills would allow him to do for the mavericks many of the same things larry bird did for the boston celtics i told him at the end of regulation that he 'll be one of the best all around players to ever play the game nelson said even with nowitzki 's performance nelson pointed to the emergence of michael finley late in the game as the key to victory finley is still recovering from a strained left hamstring that forced him to miss 13 of the last 15 regular season games he ran gingerly early in the game and looked out of sync missing his first six shots but finley hit five of his final six shots and finished with 13 points seven of those points came in the third quarter when the mavericks outscored the blazers 28 12 after trailing by 52 42 at halftime i thought the key to the game was staying with michael finley nelson said he did n't look very good in the first half neither did the mavericks who allowed the blazers to shoot 55 percent in the first two quarters falling behind by as many as 13 points but a commitment to defense in the third quarter changed that the mavericks flashed in and out of zones holding the blazers to 31 percent shooting in the second half dallas played primarily zone in the fourth quarter and portland never solved it really what won us the game i thought was that we played some solid defense in the second half nowitzki said dallas also exploited its superior free throw shooting hitting 20 of 24 from the line the blazers hit 11 of 21 the blazers failed with their game plan which revolved around using their physical superiority to push around the mavericks wallace finished with a team high 26 points for portland which will fly back to oregon because the teams do not play game 2 of their series until wednesday in dallas we lost the game but we are not going to get dejected over one loss portland guard damon stoudamire said it is a best of seven series you still have to win four games we know we have things we need to work on and we have time to work on them before wednesday while finley showed aplomb in coming back from his injury blazers point guard scottie pippen did not do the same the team 's spark since cheeks moved him to point guard nine games into the season pippen shot 2 of 8 from the field and had 4 turnovers to go with 5 assists the blazers captured their big lead in the second quarter with pippen on the bench and stoudamire in the game at shooting guard he scored 13 of his 16 points in that quarter slicing past steve nash into the lane for easy baskets but nowitzki took over with 12 points 7 on free throws in the third quarter the mavericks also exploited portland when wallace left the game for a four minute stretch after appearing to turn his ankle that ushered nowitzki to center stage which he never relented when he was n't scoring we could n't score nelson said it was a special game for him
