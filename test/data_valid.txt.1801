these are heady yet baffling times for the world 's sole superpower less than a decade after the demise of the soviet union the united states is a military and economic colossus no nation in history has possessed the wealth military might or technological edge over its rivals that america has today yet as the presidential campaign enters its final months the country seems uncertain about its role and perplexed by the changing array of threats that it faces there should be vigorous debate about these matters in the days ahead starting with an assessment of america 's critical national interests there are clear and important differences between gov george w bush and and vice president al gore on russia china missile defenses and other pressing issues we intend to return to some of these matters as the campaign unfolds but specific policies can not be developed or evaluated in isolation they should flow from principles that reflect the nation 's core values and interests it is harder today than during the cold war to define american interests and to determine how best to defend them contamination of the world 's air and water or a currency crisis in asia can threaten american security as much as a fleet of russian bombers the free flow of information across national borders may be a more potent force for advancing democracy than dispatch of american aircraft carriers to a distant sea still some core national interests remain unchanged the physical defense of america 's territory people and economic lifelines is paramount the pentagon can safely eliminate thousands of nuclear weapons left over from the cold war but must maintain enough to discourage attack america also needs highly trained and mobile military forces adequately paid and equipped with advanced weaponry washington must also guard against international terrorist groups effective intelligence gathering is an essential first line of defense washington should provide adequate financing for these purposes but spending must be based on realistic needs not inflated threat assessments or parochial congressional interests in the absence of a powerful enemy like the soviet union the country has found itself with few established guidelines to decide when military intervention abroad is warranted clearly self defense and the protection of allies and economic lifelines are reasons to use force as washington did when oil supplies were endangered by the iraqi invasion of kuwait but as recent upheavals in africa and the balkans have shown ethnic conflicts can escalate to imperil the stability of an entire region and genocidal attacks on civilians sometimes can be stopped only by outside force washington should consider intervening in such conflicts if it is clear that force can make a difference and sufficient military resources are available to assure success the case in kosovo as the last decades of the 20th century showed the defense of american security is no longer primarily defined by sending military forces into combat the united states is uniquely suited to encourage peacemaking in troubled regions like the middle east president clinton has used american influence constructively in the middle east and northern ireland and his successor should continue the work he has begun it may also be appropriate as in bosnia to send american troops overseas to serve as peacekeepers once warring parties have laid down their arms and agreed to a peace accord today the country 's security and prosperity are connected to the global movement of goods capital information and people keeping these channels of commerce and technology open can be as important as defending a foreign border washington should advance these interests through trade agreements that lower barriers to imports and investment but the preservation of a stable global economic order a vital american interest can not be accomplished without spreading prosperity 's benefits more fairly three billion people or half the world 's population live on less than 2 a day bettering their lives requires more effective governance increased private investment and expanded access to education and health care america also makes its own democracy more secure by promoting democracy elsewhere the evolution of russia and china into enduring democratic states would make the world a far safer place and erase two of the greatest potential threats to american security encouraging democracy and the rule of law in these nations should be among the primary goals of the next president protecting health and the environment are central american interests epidemics and climate change know no borders strong environmental treaties and efforts to make medicines more widely available must be a high priority for washington once mr bush and mr gore engage foreign policy they should spell out their thoughts about these broad national interests mr bush has so far taken the more creative approach to the question of nuclear weapons reductions mr gore has been more forward looking on environmental issues and has shown a more nuanced appreciation of the role american troops could play in halting regional conflicts but the debate between them has not moved much beyond rhetorical flourishes voters deserve a serious discussion of how this country 's power should be used to advance the global interests of its people
