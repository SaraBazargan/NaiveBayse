to the editor in furtherance of debra galant 's rumination regarding the mcmansion phenomenon one mcmansion with vinyl on the side jersey april 28 let 's be blunt from the outside these homes are not pretty sights these neighborhoods look like art galleries with fancy but pictureless frames instead of stimulating your imagination the typical mcmansion simply deadens your senses aside from the fact that these houses tend to have an assembly line appearance devoid of everything except excess square footage the absence of foliage in these unfortunate developments is depressing granted some of these homes are built on old farmlands that were already bereft of any tree growth but most developers seem happy to bulldoze trees in the name of cost and efficiency in order to perpetuate another act of architectural vacuity the modern subdivision a largely treeless desert where there is zero risk of your cat or little johnny getting stuck in an old oak or maple for sanity 's sake if you own one of these monstrosities or are about to build one please plant some new trees and leave the old ones alone the glare of the subdivision is killing me and everyone else who is not in love with deforested square footage glen handler glen ridge
