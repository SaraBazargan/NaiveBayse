seeking to curb profiteering by power plant owners the federal government has granted new york the power to limit spikes in the price of electricity this summer to prevent the soaring rates that hit consumers last summer the federal energy regulatory commission agreed today to the circuit breaker on rising wholesale prices that had been sought by the pataki administration and the new york independent system operator the consortium that runs the state 's power markets the mechanism permitted through oct 31 will automatically lower a power producer 's price bid that is significantly out of line with what it had been charging new york 's energy market once a tightly controlled monopoly was opened to wholesale price competition in late 1999 in hopes that competition would lower rates that were among the highest in the country last june in the first weeks of high summer demand wholesale prices nearly tripled in new york city and consumers overall bills jumped 40 percent state regulators legislators utility officials and consumer advocates have said that price manipulation by power producers was partly to blame power producers deny that there was any such manipulation wholesale prices in new york vary widely depending on the part of the state the time of day the weather and other factors at times they are close to zero but in weeks like this one with temperatures in the 90 's and air conditioners working much of the day the weekday prices in new york city and on long island are often above 100 per megawatt hour the circuit breaker approved today would kick in only when producers seek a wholesale price above 150 a price not frequently sought for instance the peak price today was just under 170 per megawatt hour for the period from 3 pm to 5 pm in contrast the peak price on wednesday was less than 65 per megawatt hour for a peak period on friday the wholesale price has already been set at 229 a megawatt hour the fluctuation in prices however is not necessarily a sign of manipulation under the new authority granted the state if a power plant offers to sell power for 100 or more above its average for the previous 90 days or for triple that 90 day average the bid would automatically be reduced to the 90 day average that would still allow sudden increases addressing only the most drastic rises for instance a plant that had sold power at a 90 day average price of 105 could abruptly raise its price to 200 without fear of a rollback the new price would not be 100 above the old price or more than three times the old price last winter gov george e pataki 's administration sensing an economic disaster in the making during the approaching summer proposed price controls that required federal approval while the federal energy commission granted the circuit breaker mechanism today it has not yet acted on new york 's call for financial penalties for power producers who are found to have manipulated prices the commission recently granted that power to california 's system operator but at this point if new york 's regulators find price gouging there is nothing they can do about it the federal commission has taken an important step toward protecting energy consumers in new york but there is more that must be done mr pataki said tonight in a statement attorney general eliot l spitzer who also lobbied the federal commission to grant the market controls said the commission must now agree to penalties for price gougers it 's incongruous that they would not extend to us what they extended to california he said independent power producers of new york a group representing plant owners noted that the federal commission 's order is only in effect through oct 31 and said that meant it had reservations about its action we believe that to have a really true competitive marketplace it has to be a regional marketplace across state lines and to put new york generators at a competitive disadvantage defeats that purpose said gavin donohue executive director of the group the chairman of the federal commission curtis hebert jr a bush appointee came into office this year expressing his opposition to any price controls he has softened that stance in the face of enormous pressure to do something about the crisis in california where rising demand a shortage of supply and price manipulation have led to higher prices and frequent blackouts the bankruptcy of major utilities and a multibillion dollar intervention into the power market by the state under deregulation new york 's utilities have sold their power plants to other companies to supply their customers the utilities now must buy power from those power producers on the wholesale market
