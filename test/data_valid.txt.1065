joe lehman 71 has been burying the dead of this town and comforting the survivors for more than 40 years today between sessions with families he considered what until recently would have been unimaginable questions does the plastic box of ashes he has been storing in his funeral home safe for more than a year contain human remains or does it hold ground up cement or something else if the ashes are human remains are they for the woman mr lehman believes them to be mr lehman had overseen the funeral and sent the body as he always did for cremations to the tri state crematory in noble ga 20 miles south now with the discovery of more than 200 bodies at the crematory the family members of the dead woman were on their way to the funeral home to pick up the box and take it to the georgia

funeral homes in tennessee georgia and alabama that sent bodies to the tri state crematory which was run by the marsh family tri state was the region 's only independent crematory a handful of funeral homes operated their own while individual homes may cater to different racial and religious groups if a family jewish baptist protestant white black rich poor wanted cremation the bodies went to tri state the funeral home directors knew and respected ray and clara marsh who had started tri state and they gave that same respect to ray brent marsh 28 the couple 's son who took over the business in 1996 but the horrific discoveries in noble where the body count is rising daily now threaten the trust that is central to the funeral home business investigators who have searched the crematory and the woods around it since friday found a skull and torso today in a nearby lake and said more bodies might be found on other property owned by the marshes the recovery of bodies officials said might take at least eight months people here talk of nothing else and funeral home owners like mr lehman who have buried generation upon generation of families and are already facing competition from
