in the past six months they have called the colt a kentucky derby thief the preakness champion a potential triple crown winner and yet another belmont stakes bust over that same span a chicago steel executive sold him to a saudi arabian prince who died over the summer the paper has changed yet again on war emblem soon he will fly to japan and retire to stud for his new owners the shadai stallion station but first the colt is coming back to where his improbable journey began for one final race the 4 million breeders cup classic the marquee race of the world thoroughbred championships on saturday no matter where he finishes among a field of as many as 13 war emblem will disappear into a japanese breeding shed as that rare horse that made all of his connections money thrilled longtime horseplayers and perhaps converted new ones to the sport he has been a gift in the craziest year of my life the colt 's trainer bob baffert said so much controversy has followed him but at the end of the day he 's just a hard running character that fans have not been able to stop falling in love with the small black colt indeed is a character one who likes to bite his trainer and the barn pony act up in morning workouts and run fast in the afternoons in fact last september in the same arlington park paddock where he will be saddled for the mile and a quarter classic war emblem unseated his jockey alfredo juarez jr and bolted into the barn area it was supposed to be the colt 's career debut but instead he was scratched the craziness however was just beginning seven races later four of them victories prince ahmed bin salmon paid 900000 for 90 percent of the colt from an 84 year old chicago area horseman russell reineman it came days after war emblem ran off with the illinois derby on april 6 across town at sportsman 's park leading every step of the way for his first stakes victory it also appeared to be a desperate purchase by an owner and a trainer who could not bear the thought that a kentucky derby would go off without their participation reineman believed war emblem was a nice horse but not nice enough to run on the first saturday in may so he kept 10 percent and wished them good luck i had no regrets selling him then and i have none now said reineman who has made close to 4 million from his interest in the colt show me another horse who has rewarded his owners and trainers so much and spread so much joy the dividend paid off immediately in the derby when the colt dismissed at 21 1 led gate to wire not only did war emblem earn a first place check worth more than 600000 but he was also awarded a 1 million bonus by the illinois derby organizers for capturing a triple crown race neither was a popular reward as the prince and baffert were accused of buying the derby with an 11th hour purchase while war emblem was charged with stealing it from the front end reineman and salman meanwhile wrangled over who deserved the 1 million bonus before later settling on a split when war emblem held off a stiff challenge to win the preakness however the magic of a potential 12th triple crown champion washed out all but the mildest strains of resentment of the last minute purchase by a saudi arabian prince and the thornier feelings in light of the sept 11 tragedies and the tensions in the mideast but alas more than 103000 people who showed up at belmont park watched war emblem nearly do a face plant coming out of the gate and lose all chance at winning the 134th running of the belmont stakes and racing 's most coveted prize baffert who twice previously had been denied a triple crown with silver charm in 1997 and real quiet in 1998 blames himself for war emblem 's failure the colt is small on his best days he weighs 1070 pounds far less than the 1150 of top class horses he was 960 pounds for the belmont the triple crown was just too much for him baffert said still baffert has better reasons not to beat up himself or his horse in july the prince had a heart attack and died in august baffert married his longtime fiancee jill moss but not before being embroiled in a controversy for accepting a 50000 appearance fee to take war emblem to monmouth park for the haskell invitational handicap which the colt won finally in september war emblem was sold to the yoshida family of japan for 17 million to replace another strong willed american racehorse who almost captured the 1989 triple crown sunday silence nothing can ever replace the prince baffert said but there is a little consolation that he did see war emblem win the derby and the preakness and that we both knew that whenever things were n't going great this little horse picked us up when war emblem shows up in barn 1a here this morning he will be greeted by a couple of old friends for whom the colt has also provided career highlights juarez who rode war emblem in his first victory and larry sterling jr who piloted him in the illinois derby he gave me the biggest win in my life and i want to say hello sterling a top rider on the chicago circuit said i want to see if he 's got some of the alertness and craziness back because he 's going to need it on saturday war emblem will most likely be the second or third favorite for his farewell race despite a disappointing sixth place finish in the pacific classic on aug 25 reineman intends to help saddle the colt who in six months has given him more memories than his 50 previous years in the horse business he does not expect war emblem to bolt from the paddock the way he did in his first race but rather blitz around the oval ahead of his rivals he knows this track and he knows how to win he said it wo n't be easy but he is running his final race at home so for the next couple of days until he is sent to japan the best thing to call war emblem is a chicago horse
