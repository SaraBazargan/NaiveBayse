the more conservative japanese diners at ikeno hana a japanese restaurant on lexington avenue near 72nd street are visibly disturbed when they see the sushi chef but the younger patrons are pleasantly surprised they are impressed as they watch the chef expertly cut raw fish and confidently mold rice in the palms of his hands they are not concerned that the sushi chef william schropp is not only one of the few non japanese in his field but also an austrian trained in french cuisine he has natural movements said yasuko nagasawa an art historian from japan who has lived in the united states for years and recently dined at the restaurant if i did n't see his face i would n't know that he was n't japanese mr schropp 33 half austrian and half danish began his career at 15 training as a chef at french restaurants in the austrian alps in 1988 he went to manhattan and got a job at odeon eight years ago he became captivated by the art of japanese sushi i kind of tripped into it said mr schropp who lives in the east village a sturdily built man with strong forearms and a brown buzz cut hidden under his chef 's hat he began his latest culinary journey when he was helping with the opening of match a restaurant in soho where the menu included sushi but when opening day arrived the owners realized that in all the confusion no sushi chef had been hired so mr schropp jumped in making basic rolls the way he had learned at nosmo king a manhattan restaurant where he had worked for a few days he relied on his smattering of previous experience along with a few basic concepts and a little improvisation i was able to pull it out of the hat said mr schropp who had always liked sushi and paid attention to what the chefs were doing at sushi bars when the owners of match finally hired two real sushi chefs mr schropp decided to stay and become their apprentice one attraction was getting out of the kitchen and into a more pleasant environment it 's not hot he said it 's not greasy you do n't get burned you get instant feedback from people when you 're in the kitchen you never get thanks you just get attitude from the waiters after perfecting his skills at mika a sushi restaurant he moved five years ago to ikeno hana where he has amassed a devoted following eve strausman a patron who lives nearby always requests that he make her sushi i never really thought about the fact that he was n't japanese she said not surprisingly mr schropp sometimes encounters resistance on the part of japanese diners because they see i 'm a white guy doing the sushi they judge me he said but he said he cares much more about the opinion of a master chef who trained in japan decades ago if he says 'good job that 's what matters to me mr schropp said genia gould
