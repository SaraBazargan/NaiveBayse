to the editor i 'm happy for for the couple described in the 'patch that saved a pregnancy nov 21 but the account of their experience brings out an important point if you do n't want to risk the safety of a healthy fetus do n't start the prenatal screening process in the first place i refused the triple screen during my two pregnancies because i had no intention of aborting a handicapped child or of risking the survival of any child in order to find out things that would be obvious enough when it was born other women may choose differently but they have the right to be fully informed and the responsibility to seriously consider the possible outcomes of their actions dawn isbell san diego
