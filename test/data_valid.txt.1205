new jersey 's attorney general today called on the state 's many arab americans to help the authorities investigating the terrorist attack on america but also warned of widespread ignorance and urged people to report any abusive treatment by law enforcement agents the attorney general john j farmer jr whose greatest challenge before sept 11 was rooting out another kind of racial profiling said that with nearly 200 people being sought by federal investigators in connection with the attacks it 's inevitable that the net is going to sweep too widely but he asked arab americans to let his office know if law enforcement is n't behaving itself part of the problem historically with law enforcement something we 're trying to change it 's going to be a slow process is that there is such a high level of ignorance out there mr farmer said we will pay for the absence of a historic dialogue between the arab american community and law enforcement by incidents of profound misunderstanding he also pleaded for help in the investigation into the attack on america asking anyone with information or anyone being sought for questioning to please come forward if only through an intermediary but mr farmer also acknowledged what he called the historic reluctance to come forward if you go back 80 years in jersey city my grandfather was in a safe house and had been smuggled in from canada because he was a fugitive from ireland he said and obviously nobody turned him in mr farmer 's remarks to about 200 members of the arab american institute a political advocacy group came at what had been scheduled months ago as a candidates forum indeed bret d schundler and james e mcgreevey the candidates for governor used the chance to preach tolerance while finding ways to score political points but each faced close scrutiny from the audience when mr schundler the republican candidate was being introduced a woman turned to a man behind her and said you know where he was two weeks ago do n't you mr schundler had been in israel with new jersey jewish leaders to show support for that country in withstanding its own attacks by terrorists mr schundler was received warmly however as he recounted his close relations with the muslim community in jersey city where he was mayor until june he said he could identify with the experiences of arab americans and muslims because his own relatives immigrants from germany had faced anti german bias during the two world wars and he urged his audience to make open shows of support for america and to help root out the murderers from our midst by offering help to law enforcement or intelligence agencies in need of arabic speakers then it will be the presence of arab americans in our midst that allows us to save american lives he said mr schundler also reminded the audience about a flap this summer in which mr mcgreevey had angered many muslims in a private meeting with jewish leaders mr mcgreevey had criticized mr schundler for speaking to another new jersey muslim group saying its national president had spoken out against israel mr mcgreevey later apologized mr schundler noted mr mcgreevey the democrat spoke briefly about the attack on the world trade center before moving onto a standard stump speech in which he repeatedly criticized mr schundler but his listeners became angry when mr mcgreevey after reaffirming his support for the state of israel appeared to evade questions about his feelings toward palestinians we do n't mind your support for israel said hani y awadallah president of the arab american civic organization support israel but at the same time understand the suffering and the tragedy of the palestinian people and how about a state of palestine shouted esmat mahmoud of middletown nj mr mcgreevey said that he supported the necessity to accommodate the interests of the palestinian people and that he hoped for a peaceful resolution to the middle east conflict but the audience appeared unsatisfied answer the question cried rasem saadah of fair lawn nj a nation challenged arab americans correction september 25 2001 tuesday an article yesterday about a new jersey candidates forum sponsored by the arab american institute in newark gave a misspelled surname in some copies for the president of the arab american civic organization who questioned a candidate for governor he is hani y awadallah not amadallah
