the holidays are almost over for lance armstrong soon there will be no more beer with meals and every morsel of food will be weighed before he eats it his daily bicycle rides will become too speedy for casual conversation the european racing season is approaching although most americans wo n't be aware of it until sometime this summer during the tour de france that mad carnival of endurance pain and drugs drugs there you go snorted armstrong typically direct engaged friendly twitchy we were sitting in a sunny hotel courtyard in palo alto calif the media including your newspaper loves to print all these rumors of what i 'm supposed to be taking when my tests come up negative the stories are much smaller if you print them at all armstrong of course is the most celebrated drug taker in sports the chemotherapy treatment that burned out the testicular cancer that had reached his brain in 1996 was the first step toward his amazing three consecutive victories in the tour starting in 1999 it happens that epo or erythropoietin the blood enriching drug prescribed to boost his chemo suppressed immune system is also the banned drug of choice among world class cyclists the european corporations that dumped him when he got sick may wish to see him turn up dirty just as the american healer dealers would like him to thank religion for pulling him through how else could this hard case turn out to be a better racer after cancer than before it that was the basic question in a remarkable panel discussion three weeks ago at stanford university called athletes winning the war against cancer sponsored by the lance armstrong foundation armstrong was joined by eric davis whose 17 year major league baseball career was briefly interrupted by colon cancer and tom gullikson the tennis player and coach who cared for his twin tim before his death from brain cancer in 1996 davis and gullikson have also sponsored cancer research and support foundations a cancer survivor i was the moderator the burnham pavilion was packed and members of the host stanford cycling club ran around with mobile microphones it was a unique event i ca n't remember when professional male athletes have offered themselves up so openly as having been frightened vulnerable and out of control of their lives there were no sports questions from a crowd as raptly quiet as a symphony audience davis tim gullikson and armstrong conditioned as male athletes to suck it up and play through pain had waited longer than most nonathletes certainly longer than most women to present their symptoms to doctors also despite their celebrity they all had their problems with patronizing and insensitive doctors davis a wry man with a deadpan humor said his tumor was big as an orange when it was finally cut out but he refused to acknowledge that it was also baseball sized he found great comfort in the support of teammates and of the baltimore orioles owner peter angelos showing up at his bedside as he woke from his operation the outfielder who retired after last season with the san francisco giants recalled moistly the first time he showed up at the ballpark after his operation as his picture flashed on the scoreboard the crowd stood and cheered once athletes submit themselves to a medical program they are usually model patients i approached cancer the way i would prepare for the tour armstrong said get in shape find out as much as you can be motivated by small results the lesion shrinking a little gave me the same kind of encouragement to keep going that i would get when my uphill times get slightly faster as expected someone at the panel discussion asked armstrong how his belief in god had helped him as a cancer patient everyone should believe in something he said in his direct way and i believed in surgery chemotherapy and my doctors the questioner looked disappointed but i felt a surge of relief armstrong is the closest i have ever come to having a role model in sports and he held his ground the intrusion of faith based treatment is pernicious as armstrong often points out good strong people get cancer and they do all the right things to beat it and they still die later he told me i guess i wo n't be able to go into politics when i stop bike racing religion is a sensitive issue with him his wife kristin who gave birth to twin girls on tuesday is a devout catholic who prays daily armstrong says they maintain an open household on the subject he assumes that their toddler luke will have some religion lance was raised by a stepfather he describes as a christian who used to beat me for silly things armstrong who calls himself agnostic says he would like to be a fair honest person who does good much of this is available in his superb autobiography written with sally jenkins it 's not about the bike my journey back to life which has just come out in paperback i feel way older than 30 he said that day in palo alto i 've lived a longer life than 30 years he figures he has at least two good racing years ahead and then i do n't really know he said i used to worry about it a lot what could i do when i was n't an athlete anymore when i 'd suddenly have to go back to waiting on lines for tables in restaurants but i do n't worry anymore since cancer he curled his lip at the coming cliche i just take it one day at a time
