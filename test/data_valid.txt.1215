at the end the metrostars players hugged as if they had just won the major league soccer title winning a game that appeared lost is one thing but an added bonus tonight was that the metrostars buried a substantial winless streak with it if we had won 5 0 it would n't have been the same midfielder billy walsh said after the metrostars scored two goals in the final minutes to defeat the tampa bay mutiny 2 1 for their first road victory of the season i think this does a lot more for us as a confidence booster we hung in there and it paid off the metrostars were 0 5 2 with only three goals in their previous seven games and they had opened the season 0 5 2 on the road walsh serving as the team captain in the absence of the injured tab ramos tied the game in the 85th minute by redirecting a free kick by defender daniel hernandez then in extra time seconds away from the end forward michael butler headed in a cross from hernandez to stun the mutiny it 's easy to put your head down and drop your arms when you 're behind with less than 10 minutes left and things are n't clicking metrostars coach octavio zambrano said so these guys deserve a lot of credit for their effort one of the beautiful things about soccer is sometimes you can win a game like this if you never stop trying tampa bay 3 12 1 has won only once in 13 games since beating the metrostars on april 21 at giants stadium and the mutiny came in only 1 5 1 at home but tonight tampa bay was spurred by a raucous crowd of 20730 banging souvenir plastic sticks finally however the metrostars 7 6 3 got a key break hernandez sent the ball from 35 yards out into a crowd and walsh redirected it by goalkeeper adin brown before the mutiny had a chance to adjust to a tie butler called up last friday from long island and with his name hastily stenciled on a road jersey then won it i knew the game was almost over and i just wanted to get down deep and hope to get a pass butler said daniel led me perfectly a goal by tampa bay forward mamadou diallo in the 27th minute appeared all that the mutiny would need as the metrostars played without ramos who was out with a sprained right ankle the metrostars the defending eastern division champions are still looking for permanent answers zambrano is trying to remedy a situation that has worsened since forward clint mathis the team 's leading scorer sustained a season ending knee injury on june 5 zambrano is exploring possible trades before the aug 15 deadline in an effort to salvage this season there are 12 regular season games left his cell phone is growing out of his right ear right now said john neves the team 's director of communications
