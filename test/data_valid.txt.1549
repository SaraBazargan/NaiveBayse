it seemed to many republicans too good to be true representative nancy pelosi an archetypal san francisco democrat assumed the leadership of the house democrats last week republicans cheerfully revived all the old stereotypes of the loony left the latte drinking culturally alien soft on national defense limousine liberals in all the chortling a few political realities got lost yes ms pelosi is a liberal 's liberal with a rating from americans for democratic action of 100 percent and a district that gave just 15 percent of its presidential vote to george w bush but she is no more of a liberal than representative tom delay the new majority leader of the republicans is a conservative with his zero ratings from the ada and the league of conservation voters the two representatives represent the heart of their parties caucuses in the house with far more ideological purity than either party would like to admit it 's perfectly symmetrical said charles cook an independent expert on congressional elections i do n't know that san francisco is any further from the ideological 50 yard line than sugar land tex is he added referring to the hometown of mr delay in fact the ascension of ms pelosi and mr delay reflects a long running trend in congress particularly in the house while presidential candidates race to the center congressional candidates often head the other way congressional republicans have grown more consistently conservative and congressional democrats more consistently liberal over the past 30 years scholars said not surprisingly their leaders come from that base said ross k baker an expert on congress at rutgers university she 's drawn fire for being some outlier but she 's not he added of ms pelosi the ideological polarization on capitol hill was most apparent in 1994 when newt gingrich took control of the house and claimed a mandate for revolutionary change his party lost seats in the next two elections in part because democrats were able to campaign against him as a conservative extremist since then leaders of both parties have grown far more savvy about the image they project republican leaders were carefully pledging to reach across the aisle and build bipartisan coalitions last week while ms pelosi was arguing with a centrist 's smile it 's not about left and right as she noted at one point i 'm a liberal democrat but i 'm a conservative catholic put that into the mix but the fact remains that the congressional wings of both parties have grown further apart particularly as the south has realigned to the republicans over the last three decades thinning the ranks of conservative southern democrats on capitol hill party unity scores a measure of how often members vote with the majority of their party were substantially higher in recent years than they were 30 years ago according to an analysis by congressional quarterly the philosophical divisions between the two parties are acutely apparent when the debate turns to issues like the role of government and health care the reasons for the great divide in the house are partly structural while presidential candidates are forced to focus on swing voters in big states house members are often elected from politically safe districts where their chief concern may be a challenge in the primary not the general election this lack of competition was strikingly apparent this year the first election following the 2000 census when as after every census congressional district lines have been redrawn and more challengers should be willing to take on an incumbent but this year redistricting became in many states an exercise in protecting incumbents as a result charles cook listed just 45 races out of 435 in the house as competitive in october at the same time 10 years ago there were 151 competitive races only 25 incumbents won with less than 55 percent of the vote according to another independent analyst rhodes cook there are still moderates in both parties elected from districts that could go either way moreover the senate elections were fiercely competitive this year and the new republican leadership there while conservative has promised to pay careful attention to the needs of their moderates those leaders are after all keenly aware of the cost of a defection given that senator james m jeffords 's departure last year cost them their majority but the ultimate counterweight to the congressional parties may be the president or in the case of the democrats the nominee it is not hard to imagine some tension between conservatives on capitol hill and a white house focused on re election in 2004 and the battleground states that will decide it in a similar situation in 1996 president clinton famously triangulated and found a third way by maneuvering between two polarized parties as for the democrats even those who praised ms pelosi said her days as the main voice and image of the party will be numbered nancy pelosi is going to be like most other minority leaders in the end said peter hart a democratic pollster they can help shape and direct the message of the party but they are not the message of the party that will be created by the nominee al from the leader of the democratic leadership council which is devoted to pushing the party to the center argued that the party 's presidential candidate is who really matters bob michel did n't define the republican party alluding to the republican house leader in the early 1980 's ronald reagan did gephardt and foley did n't define the democratic party in 1992 bill clinton did this does n't stop republicans from trying to make the most of their san francisco democrat we 've gotten fuzzy about our ability to remind people what it means to be a national democrat said bill mcinturff a republican pollster and nancy pelosi 's voting record offers a real opportunity in a lot of southern and border south districts to remind people of what it means on the other hand a few democrats remembered when republicans took aim at another democratic symbol on capitol hill thomas p o'neill jr whom they cast as an overweight caricature of democratic excess the democrats scored big gains in the following election
