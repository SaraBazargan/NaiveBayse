the producers of the producers said yesterday that calls were pouring in asking how to buy the handful of tickets they are offering to each performance for the record shattering price of 480 apiece but the reviews of their plan which they described as a war on rampant ticket scalping were more mixed than anything else received by the hit musical the message we are getting from their statement of the enormous increase of ticket price is that instead of the scalpers getting the money 'why not us said isabelle stevenson the chairwoman the american theater wing which founded the tony awards shame shame on not caring about helping make theater more available and shame for not caring for developing younger audiences for the future others in the industry clearly surprised expressed admiration for the plan and curiosity about its success this industry is usually loath to try anything out of the box said david richenthal the producer of a forthcoming revival of the crucible by arthur miller if it works most shows will try it and be grateful to 'the producers for having the guts to try it first the producers of the show confirmed on thursday that they would offer a block of 50 choice seats at every show for 480 a seat or nearly five times the current record price of 100 which was also set by the show the new tickets are expected to add some 120000 a week to the show 's income though 150 a ticket will be donated to the twin towers fund for several months the show 's producers defended their plan as an attack on scalpers some scalpers have reaped huge profits on the show by buying tickets at face value and reselling them for 800 or more said rocco landesman president of jujamcyn theaters and a backer of the show the first block of 480 tickets goes on sale next month but some people were already trying to buy them john barlow a spokesman for the show said that his office and that of the show 's producers received dozens of inquiries yesterday seeking the premium tickets the plan also seemed to focus industry leaders on trying to address scalping a persistent problem that has rarely been confronted letting market forces work in theater as they do in sporting events and concerts has law enforcement proponents including the office of eliot l spitzer the new york state attorney general who applauded the announcement the move by 'the producers is a significant step towards cutting out the middleman of corruption which has only in the past taken the money that really should have gone to the producers and the artists in the first place said eric dinallo chief of the attorney general 's investment protection bureau in april mr spitzer argued in favor of eliminating the state law that prohibits scalping and bars the resale of tickets for more than 20 percent above face value mr spitzer said then that he would support the prosecution of ticket scalpers who obtained tickets illegally through payoffs and other illegal means which is also pursued by the manhattan district attorney 's office but he said that it was unreasonable to try to control scalping if consumers were willing to pay higher prices for tickets to sporting events concerts and broadway plays instead of going after street vendors and buyers the attorney general decided to focus on large organizations that illegally obtain tickets for resale and prevent ordinary people from buying them at face value consumers will be better off if we deregulate scalping let the market function and get rid of the corruption in the box office mr spitzer said at the time you have people who are being paid bribes to secrete tickets out without the general public ever getting a chance to buy them what we need to do is focus on this theft that is where the fraud is the payoff made to a theater operator agent or theater employee is known as ice the attorney general 's office has prosecuted several cases involving such payments winning the conviction of the treasurer of the jones beach marine theater on charges of larceny and computer tampering he has executed search warrants for two new york and two new jersey ticket brokerage firms they also reviewed the records of six broadway productions at least one in each of the three major theater chains in new york as well as examining the records of a major nonprofit theater ticket brokers must be licensed by new york state which recently changed its laws making it a felony to offer or receive bribes of more than 1000 to divert tickets but some brokers are believed to pay illegal and substantial bribes in the form of premiums above a ticket 's face price to people who control tickets at the original point of sale those who have investigated the practice say they include box office employees and their supervisors managers of theaters telephone and internet ticketing agents concert promoters security personnel and house seat holders in researching a report on ticket distribution practices in 1999 the attorney general 's office issued more than 200 subpoenas for documents and testimony with many ticket brokers asserting their right against self incrimination in response because brokers who pay ice must cover the cost of the bribe which can range from 50 to 100 percent of a ticket 's face price they must resell tickets for substantially more than the law allows the authorities say these tickets are often sold by out of state brokers to new york businesses like securities firms that need them for clients one major new york securities firm paid a new jersey broker more than 360000 in 1994 according to the attorney general 's office for the best seats at various performance halls at prices ranging from 150 to 600 percent above each ticket 's face value even if the businesses are based out of state they are subject to new york law when dealing with clients in new york or when advertising in the state according to the attorney general 's office methods used by illegal brokers range from sending diggers to stand in line at the box office to using high speed dialing equipment and other tactics for increasing their chances of getting through by telephone to buying tickets from fans and sending in numerous mail order forms under different names because aggrieved parties are not always easy to identify and because the sale of tickets to new york events has largely moved onto the internet or into connecticut and new jersey where scalping is legal prosecution has been difficult prompting debate over the laws in albany while ticket brokers had been selling orchestra seats to the producers on the internet for as much as 800 apiece mr landesman said now that money will go to the people who make the show happen how those tickets will sell remains to be seen some of mr landesman 's rivals said that whatever happens the producers would reap another publicity windfall it will probably feed the mystique of 'the producers being a hit said elizabeth ireland mccann a veteran producer it just feeds the frenzy
