robert wood johnson iv will be approved by national football league owners this morning and introduced as the jets new owner soon afterward but his search for a new head coach will apparently not be as smooth a process johnson has tried to persuade bill parcells to return as head coach but all signs point against parcells returning to the sideline he said on jan 5 the day after bill belichick turned down the job as his successor that he would not come out of retirement and he is apparently sticking to that position ten months ago parcells told leon hess the jets owner before his death in may that this would be his last season and he likes to recall a saying by the former buffalo bills coach marv levy when you 're thinking of retirement you 're already retired still johnson who is paying 635 million for the jets will try again perhaps today if not tomorrow to persuade parcells to change his mind the two men met last wednesday in a get acquainted session and spoke for a few minutes again on friday johnson has wanted to be accepted officially by the other owners before making any announcements regarding the team if parcells makes his point al groh will be the next coach most of the jets assistant coaches including groh are in mobile ala sizing up the players who will be in saturday 's senior bowl the coaches will return late thursday by then johnson will know more about his team 's new coach but will probably still be wondering about the would be coach belichick commissioner paul tagliabue is expected to discuss the belichick situation with johnson today the jets contend that they retain the rights to belichick and thus will be entitled to compensation if he coaches another team he was the head coach for a day after parcells quit but then belichick resigned in a stunning development parcells said a day later that he would not coach again and he has cited so many reasons for retiring that there appears little johnson can do to change his mind parcells respects johnson and also feels an allegiance to a team whose culture he changed from perennial loser to playoff contender he also feels a moral obligation to hess who gave parcells the autonomy to shape the jets to his will and never interfered so assuming parcells rebuffs all efforts to get him back on the sideline the question becomes what role does he play and for how long the most likely answer is that parcells will continue to run the football operation as he has for three years parcells said he was willing to yield those duties to belichick but if groh were the choice for head coach the jets would be promoting someone with no experience dealing with the world of free agency and salary caps that would be even more reason for parcells not only to remain but also to have considerable input and authority among the situations johnson is thought to have envisioned with parcells is one similar to what the jets thought they had in place last season parcells was the head coach and had belichick as his top assistant apparently ready to replace him under an updated plan like that parcells as director of football operations could keep a close eye on groh or whoever might become head coach the choice of a head coach will also affect the return of the assistants dan henning for example has a second straight one year contract that is up the end of the month henning the quarterbacks coach helped mold two of the most dramatically improved players of recent nfl history in 1998 vinny testaverde blossomed to stardom at the age of 35 and this season the unheralded former special teamer ray lucas nearly led the jets to the playoffs after a 1 6 start lucas posted a 6 3 record as a starter at the age of 57 henning is not in need of a job and will wait to see how the next few days unfold he is not in mobile but a significant number of the coaches are they include the defensive line coach romeo crennel and the running backs coach mo carthon both are being interviewed by cleveland for coordinators roles to keep them parcells or groh could elevate them to that more significant post if that happened then the role of charlie weis the current offensive coordinator would have to be reassessed one of parcells 's assistant coaches who is under instructions not to say anything that could be construed as divisive at this delicate moment has nevertheless thought about what would happen if a major coaching shift took place very seldom does a staff remain intact when a new man comes in said the assistant who insisted on anonymity there would be some chance to remain but objectively you know that a new coach brings along the people he 's comfortable with parcells has vowed to try to keep the organization and the team intact he believed he could have gone to the super bowl this season had there not been an unpredictable string of injuries now he has to figure out without coaching how to keep together a club that finished strong pro football
