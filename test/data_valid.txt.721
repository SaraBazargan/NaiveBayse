all over france this week pastry makers are turning out poissons d'avril chocolate fish that are given to children on april fools day it 's one part ancient spring tradition one part silly hype some american chocolatiers join in with their own shiny chocolate sturgeon salmon and minnows or friture but would n't it be fun to make your own that has always been my fantasy or maybe i should say it was until i found out just how intricate and exasperating the art of chocolate making can be my quest started one day in the 1980 's when i spotted a french chocolate mold in a shop window in washington a meticulously detailed metal rabbit posing as if to reveal its good side it was clamped together with adorable loopy clips i did n't care that it cost 40 and came with no recipe soon my rabbit was joined by a solemn looking cat that easter i stocked up on prestige chocolate the bittersweet kind high in cocoa butter melted it and poured it into the molds success but two days later my glossy bunny and cat lost their sheen turning mouse brown with white specks i was so mortified that i put my molds on a high shelf and there they remained until i moved to paris where every holiday is an excuse for fancifully shaped candy castoff metal molds can be found in every flea market and secondhand store and in my passion to accumulate i was blind to their exorbitant prices and obvious drawback once a mold loses its shine the melted chocolate sticks i acquired my last rusty mold a deliciously wicked rabbit astride a fish in a left bank shop as i pulled out my credit card the proprietor sensing a fanatic announced that the price represented the cost of only one side i bought it anyway then vowed to myself that i was going to master this art once and for all i headed for mora a chefs emporium near les halles where glinting molds swam amid duck presses and charlotte pans grabbing a carp i looked about for guidance but the salesman could not have been less sympatique in fact every professional pastry maker i met fell silent when i dared to ask about the secrets of making poissons d'avril it 's like a guild you never give away the tricks of the trade said guy urbain a third generation candy maker and spokesman for the french chocolate industry i had met mr urbain while researching an issue that roiled the european union at the time a french led coalition wanted to outlaw the marketing of british style chocolate in which tropical oils replace some of the cocoa butter the french consider any chocolate with substitute fats an affront the british chocolate makers won and i learned later that they were onto something chocolate made with fats other than cocoa butter more easily conforms to the inside of a mold it also resists turning that embarrassing powdery white a syndrome called blooming if you want to use all cocoa butter chocolate you must temper it well improper tempering causes streaky cocoa butter to surface cookbooks describe tempering as a simple matter of heating the chocolate to about 118 degrees cooling it to 80 and then heating back to 88 and keeping it there suspecting that that was n't that easy i visited jacques torres the transplanted frenchman who has a 5000 square foot chocolate factory in brooklyn i took my mora fish along he smiled nostalgically at the sight of the old school mold then got to work amid an array of high tech equipment in two temperature controlled chambers first he set out a steel bowl of 1185 degree chocolate a broad spackling knife a laser thermometer and a heat gun the kind used to remove paint he dumped some melted chocolate on a marble slab and worked it back and forth then blended it with the hotter chocolate using the laser to check the temperature whenever it sank too low he blasted the sides of the bowl with the heat gun the mold should be 88 too he said testing it by holding it against his cheek he spooned some chocolate into the mold then refrigerated it briefly he repeated this building up a layer about a quarter inch thick minutes later he knocked out the two halves and sealed them to form a perfect poisson what a tease back home i got out my favorite belgian chocolate a dough scraper an immersion thermometer a hair dryer and my molds hours later i had a hollow fish and a solid easter bunny glossy and aromatic but two days later the creatures went dull the dreaded bloom on the internet i found evidence of other chocolate lovers broken dreams laser thermometers are hawked for 100 home tempering machines are about 400 and there are molds old ones new ones metal and plastic people hunt us down said thomas elsinghorst director of customer solutions at tomric a buffalo company that makes molds for professionals including mr torres using polycarbonate as dense and shiny as polished granite metal chocolate molds it turns out have been strictly for tourists for quite some time mr elsinghorst whose father taught him to temper chocolate as a child said that when he makes truffles only the finest imported cocoa butter laden chocolate will do but chocolate rabbits give his company 's chocolate a try he suggested it 's what i use when i make candy with my own kids and we want to have fun this so called confectionary chocolate made with hydrogenated palm oil lacks that exquisite melt in your mouth flavor of cocoa butter chocolate but guess what it works for details wwwmakenmoldcom and what about my latest failure those broken fish and blooming rabbits i melted them down and made a rich matte finish chocolate tart from its shelf in my kitchen i thought i saw my metal rabbit smile
