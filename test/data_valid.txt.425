as winter weather approaches and november winds start to bite you might be tempted to think that global warming is a myth but you would be very wrong the meteorological extremes of recent years sudden temperature changes droughts floods heat waves may or may not be a result of an earth that is gradually warming but it is warming and human activities that burn fossil fuels are to blame for at least part of the increase and perhaps most of it when coal oil and gas burn they release so called greenhouse gases which trap the sun 's heat in the earth 's atmosphere you may also think that major industries are the primary culprits and that consequently there is little that you can do to alleviate the problem again you would be wrong a handy book by an environmental policy specialist offers 51 easy ways many of them money saving that all of us can adopt to minimize the release of greenhouse gases most changes can be made with little compromise to the quality of modern life in fact they can often improve living conditions and some like relying more on human energy and less on gas powered motor vehicles can improve health as well the book aptly titled you can prevent global warming and save money was written by dr jeffrey langholz at the monterey institute of international studies in california and kelly turner an environmental writer it was published this year andrews mcmeel publishing of kansas city mo 1095 cutting back painlessly of the 11 greenhouse gases one carbon dioxide the primary gas formed when organic matter burns accounts for more than half the world 's global warming problem for example a typical passenger car emits 12000 pounds of it a year and a coal burning power plant releases about 3 billion pounds a second greenhouse gas methane is rarer but 23 times as potent in terms of global warming home energy the way you light heat and cool your home how you prepare and store your food and even the way you use water can have a major effect on energy savings switching from incandescent light bulbs to long lasting compact fluorescent bulbs using dimmer switches and motion sensors and turning off lights when you leave a room can greatly reduce your electrical usage and costs do not overchill keep your refrigerator at 37 to 40 degrees and the freezer at zero to 5 degrees turning up the temperature of every refrigerator in america by one degree would keep three million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year discard that old spare inefficient refrigerator and save 150 a year show the same restraint with air conditioning when summer returns one degree warmer and 55 million tons of co2 would be kept from the atmosphere rely more on cooling techniques that guzzle less energy like ceiling or window fans evaporative coolers and dehumidifiers close drapes blinds or shutters on sunny windows or install awnings or solar window screens ventilate and better insulate the attic and plug air leaks around windows and doors these steps will also reduce the wasted heat in cool months insulate the floors above unheated basements and crawl spaces with a greater initial investment you can also save on cooling and heating and reduce greenhouse gases by replacing old windows furnaces and air conditioners the best windows those with low emissivity low e coatings which restrict heat transfer insulate five times as well as single paned windows dr langholz and ms turner report landscaping too can help you save on energy costs a windbreak of evergreens on the north side of a house can cut heating bills by a third and you can cut air conditioning costs in half by plantings bushes high canopy trees vines on trellises and wooden screens that shade the roof and sunniest walls of the house and the air conditioners trees as the authors point out are nature 's air conditioners in addition to providing shade they actually cool the surrounding air by about nine degrees when their water evaporates of course you do not want to defeat the purpose by plantings that use more energy than they save grass for example needs more water and maintenance than anything else you might plant it also has to be mowed and mowing usually requires gasoline a rechargeable electric mower or better yet an old fashioned push mower that uses your energy is far better consider your climate temperate zone plantings in the desert are both extremely wasteful and costly to the environment to keep from wasting water sprinklers should be fitted with automatic rain sensors and directed only at plants not sidewalks and driveways energy wise travel americans who can afford it tend to be highly independent and self indulgent note the number of gas guzzling suv 's on the road today and the number of cars during rush hour that carry only the driver cars account for 21 percent of the world 's global warming emissions avoid rapid accelerations and idling keep tires properly inflated and slow down the faster you drive above 55 miles an hour the more gas is used per mile when you are ready for a new car consider an energy saving gas electric hybrid and check the fuel efficiency before you buy take public transportation or use a carpool whenever possible also consider telecommuting one day a week or more combine errands to reduce the number of trips and whenever possible shop bank and pay bills online better yet use your own power your feet a bicycle or person powered scooter for trips of a mile or so this can eliminate about one fourth of all automotive trips low energy diet you can save the earth and people on it and improve your health by changing how you eat and dispose of waste beef cattle are the leading producers of methane after termites followed by sheep and pigs better for your health and the earth 's is to eat more chicken and fish still better eat fewer animal foods and more plant foods especially those organically grown a process that means fewer energy consuming pesticides are used dr langholz and ms turner note that the average meal travels 1200 miles by truck ship and or plane to reach your dining room table to reduce the energy costs of carrying foods eat more locally grown products shop at farmers markets if possible plant your own organic vegetable garden recycling more finally learn all you can about recycling and reusing materials compost all vegetable waste including lawn trimmings and leaves and use the resulting soil for planting reuse shopping bags and your own cloth bags for groceries packaging buy products with the least packing and nonperishable items in bulk to save on packaging and stop junk mail the direct marketing association 's web site can help you get off mass mailing lists for five years for 5 it is wwwthedmaorg cgi offmailinglistdave
