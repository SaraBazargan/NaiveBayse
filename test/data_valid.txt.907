gen wesley k clark will be seriously handicapped in his campaign for the democratic presidential nomination because of his late start many political strategists in both parties and students of elections said today the problem you have getting in this late is you have no field troops you have no ground operation said bill dal col who ran steve forbes 's campaign for the republican nomination in 1996 and 2000 without the troops it does n't matter how good your logistics and planning are tony coelho who was al gore 's campaign chairman during the 2000 primaries said what people do n't understand is that it takes a long time to develop an operation and relationships and a finely tuned staff it takes months to do that mr dal col said that when mr forbes finally decided to run in september 1995 he quickly learned that people he needed as supporters were already committed to other candidates in iowa there was no one left for me to go get mr dal col said in new hampshire almost everyone had already picked sides the problem is worse now than it used to be because the filing deadlines and primaries and caucuses are earlier than ever before about one third of the states will pick their democratic delegates next january and february and another third will vote on march 2 the deadlines and rules for getting on the ballot vary widely by state and mastering the laws can be a daunting task mr dal col said mr forbes had to spend 2 million to gather enough signatures for a place on the new york ballot in 1996 and was left off the ballot in rhode island that year because of mistakes by his staff william g mayer a political scientist at northeastern university in boston who edits a book of essays every four years on the race for the white house said that 20 or 25 years ago a candidate like jimmy carter could raise enough money to campaign successfully in iowa and new hampshire and then use those successes to raise enough for the rest of the primary season now he said candidates like general clark must raise almost all they need for the primaries at least 20 million before the voting begins between setting up an organization and raising money and dealing with the legal challenges of getting on all the ballots it 's an enormous challenge for him to take on in a very short time and he 's going to be hard pressed to accomplish that mr mayer said rhodes cook an independent political analyst with a book the presidential nominating process being published next month said at this point you need a 50 hour day to have a presence in all the states that are voting early thomas e mann a senior fellow at the brookings institution and an expert on campaigns and elections said it was possible that general clark would catch on fire immediately and attract the money talented staff and endorsements needed for a victorious race if the general does not become an instant phenomenon mr mann said it will be a real slog for him the one candidate in recent elections who started late and won the nomination was bill clinton who did not commit himself definitely to running in 1992 until the late summer of 1991 but that was an aberrational election cycle mr cook said because the persian gulf war and president george bush 's popularity in the aftermath kept many democrats from getting in the race early other seemingly attractive candidates were left in the dust because of their late starts including senator frank church of idaho who ran for the democratic nomination in 1976 and senator howard h baker jr of tennessee who sought the republican nomination in 1980 by the time howard baker got in mr mayer said he found that people who might have gone with him six months before were already committed to someone else mr mayer said the eight candidates for the republican nomination in 1996 made their formal announcements an average of 16 months before their august convention anita dunn a democratic consultant who worked on bill bradley 's 2000 campaign said new political tools might mean that the lessons of previous elections would not apply this year for example she said the internet might enable general clark to raise money and organize supporters more quickly and efficiently than candidates could in the past except for gen alexander m haig jr who ran for the republican nomination in 1988 but withdrew early general clark will be the first general to run a full scale presidential campaign since dwight d eisenhower in 1952 and 1956
