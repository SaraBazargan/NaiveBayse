even before investigators determine the precise cause of the shuttle columbia 's disintegration it increasingly looks as if nasa has forgotten the key lessons of its last space tragedy the explosion that destroyed the shuttle challenger during liftoff in 1986 that accident was attributed to the failure of a seal on a booster rocket but its deeper cause was institutional the operating culture and attitudes that led nasa to ignore mounting evidence that the seals might fail new information on the columbia flight makes us wonder whether the agency is still gripped by a cross your fingers mentality that tolerates risks that should be eliminated or mitigated by engineering or operational changes nobody yet knows what caused the columbia 's demise but the leading theory is that debris falling off the external fuel tank during ascent damaged the delicate ceramic tiles that protect the shuttle from the extreme heat during re entry if that proves to be the case nasa will need to explain why it discounted that risk both during this flight and in the years leading up to it the most troubling new information is contained in e mail notes among space engineers who sounded a lot more worried that columbia could be in peril than anyone had previously recognized although the import of these e mail messages has been minimized by space officials as what if worst case scenarios they sound eerily prescient indeed the accident unfolded much as the engineers predicted it would if superheated gases penetrated protective surfaces and reached into the left wing one engineer rightly wondered why he and his colleagues were debating all that at the last minute on the day before re entry underscoring nasa 's helter skelter approach to assessing risk space officials seemed determined not to confront the worst possibilities perhaps because they thought there was little they could do to save the shuttle if tiles had been breached after a nasa employee asked the military to help ascertain whether the underside of the shuttle 's wing had been damaged presumably by using high resolution telescopes another nasa official canceled the request saying the debris strike was not considered a major problem in the end the decision that the shuttle could survive re entry was made mostly by a handful of boeing engineers who discounted the projections of a computer program that said the debris might have caused extensive damage to the tiles boeing assumed that a quarter inch thick densified layer at the bottom of each tile would somehow survive and provide protection although nasa accepted boeing 's optimistic analysis it is not yet clear how closely the agency 's own experts monitored the process boeing had an inherent conflict of interest in that it has a financial stake in the shuttle 's success and was passing judgment on its own performance in ensuring the shuttle 's safety how high up the nasa management structure these debates over a possible catastrophe percolated has not yet been revealed sean o'keefe the agency 's administrator said that he had been unaware of the technical disagreements while they were occurring but he questioned whether top managers should be routinely involved in technical issues that lie beyond their technical competence that seems a misguided segmentation of responsibilities in an agency where a technical failure can bring operations to a halt and threaten the very survival of manned space programs
