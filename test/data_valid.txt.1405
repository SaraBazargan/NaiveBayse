any movie brash enough to put the word american in its title is announcing its intention to make a sweeping statement about some aspect of the national psyche putting together the words american and pimp sets off instant buzzers and creates huge expectations for a provocative cinematic dialogue between flag waving righteousness and urban sleaze but american pimp a terse skillfully edited documentary by the hughes brothers allen and albert does n't live up to its title the movie which the filmmakers researched for several years purports to uncover the realities behind the myths surrounding those flamboyantly attired street hustlers who were mainstays of 1970 's blaxploitation films but instead of shattering or even seriously challenging those stereotypes this breezy montage of interviews with pimps of varying ages in several american cities only reinforces them some of the pimps interviewed all male and all black are obviously nicer to the women whose flesh they peddle than others are the movie bends over backward to be nonjudgmental but there is simply no getting around the reality that urban street level prostitution is a nasty game that exploits and degrades the women who get caught up in it the only scene in which the panderers and prostitutes do n't appear desperate beneath a surface bravado is a brief visit to a whorehouse in nevada where prostitution is legal here the women have some choice about their sexual partners as well as an economic stake in the business no one ever said a pimp 's life is easy as one man after another tells his story we hear complaints that pimps get no corporate benefits or no health insurance or retirement plan if they 're lucky enough to stay out of prison and have long careers on the street they might be able to retire in middle class comfort we meet one man who married his last prostitute and retired from the business to become a churchgoing family man he seems to feel no regrets about his past american pimp proposes one fascinating theory about the origins of the pimp stereotype he arose it is suggested during the days of slavery when enterprising black men on plantations appointed themselves protective intermediaries between their wives daughters and sisters and the white slave owners who preyed on them but having been mentioned the idea is never developed a more substantial movie would have dug up historical photographs drawings and texts and made at least a token effort to trace and analyze this lineage instead the movie prefers to examine the fashion choices of pimps like the fetish for alligator shoes but here too its attention span flags the movie might have been much more revealing had it been content to be a history of changing tastes in pimp fashions exploring such a theme it might have been possible to find a sociological connection between style and behavior as the movie illustrates the iconography of pimp fashion is nothing if not provocative in its fusion of designer label chic cowboy machismo and the same sort of parody of european royalty affected by liberace of all people and adopted and carried to extremes of stage caricature by musicians like george clinton what it amounts to of course is a grotesque intentionally funny form of ostentatious consumption a parody of a capitalist excess but such flamboyance also has its uses the pimps interviewed remind us that all that flashy garb augmented with gold and jewelry is also a professional ploy to attract women because it is an announcement of wealth almost to a man the pimps interviewed cite money some also mention the freedom as the motive for becoming a procurer it 's certainly not the women whose flesh they peddle and to whom they refer in crude anatomical slang although a couple of the women interviewed say they feel loved and protected by their pimps during the one scene in which a pimp is interviewed with a woman sitting on either side both seem intimidated and speak haltingly with fear in their voices american pimp would have been a much stronger movie had it chosen only one or two pimps and seriously delved into their lives and followed their financial and sexual transactions but the movie does n't include a single scene of a pimp or a prostitute interacting with a client what we are left with is a mildly entertaining man on the street gloss seasoned with fragments from blaxploitation movies and music by isaac hayes marvin gaye and others the mood built up by the film might almost be called nostalgic american pimp directed by the hughes brothers director of
