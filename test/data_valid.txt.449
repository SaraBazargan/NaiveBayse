the pundits who keep watch over weather patterns have predicted that droughts such as what the northeast experienced last summer may be repeated again this year with all the enthusiasm and forward planning being made for the new year this sort of forecast might be a wise caution for a good gardener to keep in mind as a case in point for weird weather patterns many plants appeared to be out of whack this fall rhododendrons and azaleas were in bloom forsythia showed off some perky yellow flowers even the bulb foliage started to push up all of this was due to the warm fall season the unpredictable part of all the warm weather is how long it may take for some of the serious effects to show up on landscape plants dry soil and intense heat cause long term problems especially for the woody ornamentals the effects may not show up for several years carol sosa the shop manager for the bowman 's hill wildflower preserve in new hope pa noted in a recent newsletter from the preserve even prickly pear cactus wrinkled up a bit with the heat ms sosa went on to describe other plant responses to climate stress there are numerous ways that plants by nature cope with drought some ordinarily tall species will not reach their full height some like great st johnswort finish blooming almost before they 've begun some save energy by producing very little if any seed some bloom early forced by heat and stress the answer then to such a predicament is to select as many drought tolerant plants to grow as possible native plants seem to have a built in tolerance to climate extremes and have thus far done well particularly fine show offs have been the butterfly weeds boneset and baptisia another winner is echinacea this year one of the most fascinating echinaceas to come on the garden scene is a dwarf echinacea called kim 's knee high this particular coneflower was selected and introduced by kim hawks owners of niche gardens in chapel hill nc kim 's knee high is a true dwarf coneflower and grows to about 2 feet in height it has the pink daisy blooms and attracts many butterflies this particular drought tolerant plant does best if it has a good sunny location daylilies seem to have drought tolerance as well as many of the fall blooming plants such as asters and heliopsis among the annuals melampodium a prolific yellow daisy blooms consistently in heat and drought so do the marigolds also most of the geraniums seem to be able to perform well in spite of climate stress another newcomer will certainly deserve some prominent garden space is the new mexican sunflower or tithonia named fiesta del sol this one is sure to carry on in spite of heat and drought the advance praise for this newcomer includes a vital point it is compact and not as tall as most of the standard types the predictions for a dry hot summer also provide clues for the sort of plants that might not fare well at the top of the list are the thin leaved plants that can not hold their own supply of water such as impatiens this annual droops easily if it does not have a good supply of water if there is opportunity to supplement garden water where the impatiens thrive then there is no concern however where there are watering restrictions some thought might be given to a few other showy summer plants another thin leaved sort that promptly shows water stress is coleus there are so many dramatic new forms of late it seems difficult not to plan for scores of these plants again good planning sense here will be important nasturtiums like full sun and do well but they also may prove to be thirsty plants for the long hot summer of course good gardeners plan well ahead for such calamities they know well that a sturdy mulch of chopped leaves or compost can do wonders to keep the soil moist and cool and control unwanted weed growth but it would be practical to make note of the various descriptions provided for the plants highlighting those plants with particular drought tolerance might be good to included in plans and then with all of this cautionary planning the summer could be a drencher as the old wag goes there is not much that can be done about the weather except talk about it
