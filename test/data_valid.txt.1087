a tempest of rumor suspicion and denial has swirled around masaru hayami the governor of the bank of japan the country 's central bank since the beginning of the week has he resigned will he resign is someone plotting to push him out government officials again scotched rumors today that mr hayami had tendered his resignation to the new prime minister junichiro koizumi mr koizumi said he has not received any formal resignation said kazuhiko koshikawa the prime minister 's spokesman mr hayami himself said in washington on monday that he was mystified by press reports that he had decided to step down returning to tokyo yesterday he refused to address the question officials at the bank of japan said the resignation rumors were strongly suggestive of a plot by the finance ministry to take advantage of the vigorous political ferment that has followed mr koizumi 's surprising election their suspicions are evidence that the feud between the bank of japan and the ministry is far from over the two institutions have been fighting like small boys in a sandbox ever since the bank of japan which controls monetary policy was wrested from the ministry 's control in 1998 the ministry was also stripped of its oversight role in the banking and financial services industries since then the bank because of its independence has gained power and influence while the ministry 's authority has waned the bank 's ascendancy stings all the more because finance ministry officials who tend to be the top graduates of japan 's elite universities have always looked down on their counterparts at the bank who tend to be more international more courtly and more cerebral there are a lot of people in the finance ministry who have seen everything they worked for gutted over the last three years said robert alan feldman chief economist at morgan stanley dean witter and they would have to be superhuman not to feel hurt by that particularly when it is the bank that has gotten stronger at their expense the quarrel reached a peak last fall when the finance ministry was convinced that the bank 's monetary policy was too tight but it seemed to have spent itself by march when the bank changed course to focus on the money supply rather than interest rates mr feldman and some other economists even foresaw a new era of cooperation among the ministry the bank and the financial services agency which now presides over the banking system and has taken the lead in pushing industrial and financial reform nonetheless mr feldman said i still see a reluctance by the finance ministry guys to think that the ministry has any role to play in structural reform here they seem not to be willing at this point to join in this cooperative game that is emerging earlier today the chief government spokesman yasuo fukuda strongly suggested that rumors of mr hayami 's resignation might have been manufactured by the japanese media the way the news broke supports mr fukuda 's supposition the first article in yomiuri shimbun the most conservative of japan 's major newspapers appeared in an edition that hit the streets friday afternoon when mr hayami was on a washington bound plane bank of japan officials contend that the report the lead article in the paper was timed to coincide with mr hayami 's absence and it took them completely by surprise senior bank officials could not flatly deny the report because they were aware that mr hayami had spoken to the outgoing finance minister kiichi miyazawa about potentially resigning his post but they said they were certain the governor had not tendered any sort of formal resignation and they insisted that mr hayami was not contemplating stepping down as a way of acknowledging that he and the bank had bungled by raising interest rates marginally last summer just as the economy was losing steam yet again the bank reversed the interest rate increase in march mr hayami 76 has appeared feeble and tired in the last six months and videotape of alan greenspan coming to his rescue when he stumbled down a set of stairs in palermo italy was broadcast repeatedly on japanese television over the weekend but bank officials said mr hayami is as healthy as might be expected at his age and that he had simply tripped in palermo difficulty overcoming jet lag sometimes makes him seem doddering when he is just sleep deprived they said still they acknowledge that he has thought about cutting short his term which runs another two years he has lost some of his sway over the bank 's policy board since the interest rate about face and he is said to feel that the frequent international travel required is increasingly taxing his health but bank officials said he would not go unless he was sure of a replacement to his liking he is said to favor toshihiko fukui current chairman of the fujitsu research institute and a former senior bank official who was groomed for mr hayami 's job but had to resign amid a series of scandals three years ago if any of the candidates backed by the finance ministry seemed to have a chance mr hayami would stay on they said and mr koizumi is not likely to force the issue though mr hayami was appointed by mr koizumi 's political rival ryutaro hashimoto the new prime minister and the bank governor have been on good terms for a decade and see eye to eye on structural reform with this new administration the reform agenda is going to move forward and in a way that reflects hayami 's view of things mr feldman said the view that the bank of japan must take steps as part of a broader context of economic reform is coming to be popular
