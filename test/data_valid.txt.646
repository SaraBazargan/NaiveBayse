human fat scorned and despised and ruthlessly vacuumed from bellies and backsides by liposuction may have a redeeming feature after all the much maligned tissue appears to be a rich source of stem cells prized by scientists for their seemingly magical power to turn into a variety of tissue types stem cells harvested from fat proved capable of becoming muscle bone or cartilage depending on the conditions in which they were grown scientists reported today in the journal tissue engineering the discovery means that a person 's own fat might one day be used to provide the tissue needed to treat disease or repair injured or worn out parts theoretically people might be able to get rid of their love handles while supplying the material needed to fix a creaky knee or hip unlike a transplant tissue created by a person 's own stem cells would pose no risk of rejection or exposure to viruses from a donor fat may be a practical source of cells from which to make new tissues said dr marc h hedrick an assistant professor of surgery and pediatrics at the university of california at los angeles and the director of the study in which researchers from the university of pittsburgh collaborated this changes the way we think about fat tissue dr hedrick said it 's not a static spare tire around our waist it 's really a dynamic tissue and there are a lot of things in it that could help us fix people with diseases stem cells for research has been collected from bone marrow brain or fetal tissue but the use of fetal tissue has provoked ethics disputes and performing brain surgery to harvest stem cells is not practical small amounts of stem cells can be extracted from bone marrow but removing marrow from a patient can be painful liposuction is much easier dr hedrick said we harvest liters of fat and toss it away he said that he and his colleagues decided to look for stem cells in fat because fat marrow and bone in humans developed from the same layer of embryonic tissue the mesoderm and tissues from the same origin often had properties in common so if bone marrow has stem cells it 's not crazy to think that fat should have them too he said the researchers saved fat from liposuction and processed it to isolate cells thought to include stem cells then dr hedrick said to get things revved up you have to feed the cells the right stuff to coax the cells to make bone for instance the researchers used a medium containing calcium phosphate and vitamin c he said they varied the conditions to grow cartilage muscle or more fat cells the study was the first to find stem cells in fat and use them to grow different tissues like any other study it must be repeated by other researchers to find out whether the conclusions hold up even if they do dr hedrick said using fat to provide tissue for patients is a long way off and a procedure for doing so is not clear scientists must determine for instance whether stem cells can be given to patients or whether the cells must be cultured in the laboratory to turn them into the desired tissue then implanted where needed it will be a fun problem to work out dr hedrick said he also said that he and his colleagues had access to a great deal of fat and plenty of eager donors
