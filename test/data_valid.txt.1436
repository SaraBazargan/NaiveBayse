boogaloo the quintessence of american popular music by arthur kempton illustrated 498 pp new york pantheon books 2750 arthur kempton is the son of the pulitzer prize winning newsday columnist and author murray kempton who died in 1997 the two collaborated in 1991 on a portrait of big joe turner for an anthology called bluesland but boogaloo is the younger kempton 's first full length work it 's an ambitious but frustrating attempt to unify nearly a century of black popular music by examining the careers of key musicians like the gospel songwriter thomas a dorsey the soul singer sam cooke the motown impresario berry gordy and the rapper tupac shakur boogaloo like much hip hop is built on others work kempton announces in his acknowledgments that i am my book 's only original source and the notes section is a long lonely march of ibid s citing crucial sources like anthony heilbut 's excellent book the gospel sound and rob bowman 's account of stax records soulsville usa kempton 's decision to forgo new research means that the strength of his book will rest on his commentary built around a handful of his reviews for the new york review of books boogaloo has the feel of a manuscript that 's been worked over for years with narrative signposts cleared out to make room for observations that are occasionally lucid but more often baroque though named after an obsolete synonym for funk the meaning of which does n't get unpacked until page 385 boogaloo is most generous toward gospel preachers especially which explains some of kempton 's artificially exalted language the clerical vaguely disgusted tone of the book suggests kempton sees something crass at the heart of pop music but the spray of anachronisms does n't get him to the promised land if you prefer thrice to three times this is the book for you more seriously indefinite antecedents like it pile up and leggy precious sentences require multiple scans in the early chapters on dorsey kempton sums up big ideas well discussing dorsey 's protegee mahalia jackson and her rise to popularity on tv and radio kempton writes mahalia would be broadcast so often into so many living rooms she became like an ambassador to suburban america from its kitchen help the cooke section elicits kempton 's best writing when the young apollonian cooke joins or collides with an older dionysian gospel group the soul stirrers he grows up fast cooke was trained as a mama 's boy to the companionship of women and conditioned to exploit it through his companionship with men cooke created a cooler calmer gospel singing style an unyielding collectedness to reach a wider whiter audience kempton is keen about soul singing and where the money went but displays contradictory feelings about music for mass markets a business that prefers creativity to be reiterative has n't he just shown us that gospel thrived on repetitive showmanship and tricks this bias is the acorn that will grow to block out the book 's light selling records is a sin kempton rarely forgives after the cooke section music takes a tiny rumble seat to kempton 's interest in business deals one of the revelations contained herein is that record company owners rip off their artists even when they 're both black berry gordy kept his motown 'family believing the yoke he had on their necks was an instrument of mutual improvement the motown section bogs down in creepy quotations from iceberg slim 's memoir pimp and kempton 's world weary tone skirts indiscriminate misanthropy as the 1970 's approach words begin to bounce off the wall kempton 's interchangeable use of aframerican black and negro is distracting the choice to write nigger as n egro is condescending euphemizing raped as been made sport by is just wrong and someone who alleges that good lawyers are free enterprise 's only permanent working class probably is n't qualified to discuss the working class of the music business is kempton just taken with the language of a lost era or with the ideas too the chapters on the parliament funkadelic mastermind george clinton and hip hop read like a compulsory addendum kempton proposes that because of hip hop the music of james brown was still integral to records selling in the millions and nobody would know but the plunderers of his work and a few copyright lawyers maybe kempton was out of town in 1986 but every hip hop listener dj and record store employee knew james brown was being sampled in many hip hop songs parliament 's song bop gun is attributed to the wrong album another song flashlight is damned with faint praise young senses were kept pleasurably overstimulated throughout while parliament 's elastic and luminous 1978 hit aqua boogie is deemed not a well made dance record but after misidentifying grandmaster flash the most famous dj in hip hop history as a rapper kempton opines that clinton 's musicians were crafters of the most sophisticated popular music of the 20th century 's last quarter the flare ups of appreciation are just confusing after spending 400 pages watching kempton describe an arc of degradation in popular music the chapters on tupac shakur and death row records retell well worn stories of criminal activity in kempton 's odd voice tupac undergoes embourgeoisement apparently without anesthesia and after his death his mother would prove an implacable petitioner for tupac 's 40 acres and a mule is kempton calling all black musicians slaves just tupac if kempton is aiming higher than clever he needs to be clearer the music gets scant attention able to discuss the influential use of minimalist horns on otis redding 's records kempton describes dr dre 's musical style as a tunesmith 's fine attunement to the sweet sound of a cash registering hook it would be the perfect moment to get specific and discuss how dr dre changed the sound of pop music several times beginning with his revival of analog synthesizers on his album the chronic but kempton instead adjudges dre an assembler of the work of many hands something that could be said of all pop producers cut in half boogaloo would be a fine contribution to cooke studies beefed up with some hard theory it could work as a slightly florid marxist view of black pop history lacking a coherent theory boogaloo remains a long sour compilation sasha frere jones is a writer and musician from new york he is working on a book about the history of record production in hip hop
