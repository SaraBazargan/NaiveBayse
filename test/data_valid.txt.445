to the editor i was quite taken aback to read that roadside memorials to traffic accident victims are illegal in most states news article june 23 memorial crosses placed at the scene of a tragic accident send a poignant message when motorists see these memorials they take a moment to reflect on their own driving habits and drive with more care a white cross or any other personal memorial speaks much louder than an official highway sign what grabs your attention more an official sign cautioning against drunken driving or speeding or a simple cross marking the loss of a loved one states should dedicate more time to making our highways safer and our drivers more responsible memorials placed on the side of the road to honor the dead hurt no one and go a long way toward preventing similar tragedies jessica farrell chateaugay ny june 26 2000
