as long as joyce weingart can remember the little dirt road behind her torrington farmhouse has been unchanged narrow bumpy and lined with aging sycamores gaylord lane has sliced its way through the open land on torrington 's east end since the area was settled in the early 18th century as a young girl ms weingart would ride her bicycle along the road sometimes stopping to wave to local farmers like her father on their way to or from their fields gaylord lane one of only a handful of dirt roads in this city of 35000 has been on local maps since the first farm plots were drawn up in 1732 by the town leaders of windsor which then controlled the land but while ms weingart 62 and the handful of other property owners who line this half mile stretch of old fashioned throughway have enjoyed its country charms for generations and hope to do so for years to come the road 's future is far from certain earlier this year the city 's engineering department proposed abandoning the road which officials say is too expensive to maintain or pave a small portion of the western edge of the road where it meets torringford street a busy thoroughfare was paved years ago but the remaining stretch which ultimately runs into harrison road to the east remains as it was 200 years ago by abandoning the dirt portion of the road and ceding its ownership and responsibility for maintenance to abutting property owners the city hoped to free itself of a problem edward fabbri the city engineer estimated that paving the rest of gaylord lane and bringing it to modern city standards would cost upward of 200000 a hefty sum for a cash strapped municipality like torrington the city 's streets department no longer owns the grading equipment needed to maintain the road and while estimates for regular maintenance vary mr fabbri has said it would be too costly gaylord lane is the city 's only dirt road with houses along it the other two dirt roads in torrington are in a park abandoning the road just makes the most sense from the city 's perspective mr fabbri said the proposal however did not sit well with gaylord lane 's residents and many of them packed into a city hall hearing on jan 22 and lobbied the council to vote against the proposal this road has been on city maps since there was a city it 's part of torrington 's history and the city should keep it and maintain it ms weingart told city officials the city 's six member council voted unanimously against the abandonment proposal but shortly after the council vote mr fabbri drafted a 10 page letter to mayor owen quinn recommending that the city reconsider the abandonment proposal mr fabbri outlined the costs of upkeep for the road and noted that gaylord lane is also too narrow for access by city snowplows and other pieces of service equipment even keeping gaylord lane as one of the city 's few dirt roads would require widening something that its residents have opposed the problems for gaylord lane first arose late last year when timothy schapp a city firefighter bought a plot on the north side of gaylord lane and began building a house there mr schapp asked the city to grade the road in front of his new property so his driveway could be accessed with something other than a jeep he got a surprising response the city told him that he could not legally build a driveway leading to a dirt road because of an unwritten municipal policy that meant that mr schapp would have been forced to build a 1500 foot driveway to his property 's far edge where it borders the paved part of the street not enthusiastic about the idea which would also have required mr schapp to obtain approval from the zoning and wetlands office the new property owner asked if there were any alternatives mr fabbri proposed the abandonment scenario while he would prefer not to pay to maintain the road mr schapp said that he is not opposed to the abandonment proposal if it would allow him to build his driveway he estimates that it would cost a few thousand dollars each year to keep the road smooth enough for regular traffic i want to keep the road as it is too but i have to be able to access my property mr schapp said the other gaylord lane residents can get to their houses from the paved portion of gaylord or from other streets the city council is considering the residents efforts to keep the road from being abandoned the has council asked mr fabbri to send a letter to all property owners on gaylord lane asking them to tell city hall what they would like to see done councilman rick dalla valle said he would reserve judgment until he had heard from all those involved but favored keeping the road unpaved and on city maps we do n't want to see it turned into a super highway and it does n't have to cost a quarter of a million dollars he said the meeting with the property owners which city hall officials said would take place in the coming weeks is to replace a planned public hearing on the issue arguments against the abandonment proposal remain heartfelt and the road 's place in the city 's history is at the center of the pleas to keep the road as is according to mark mceachern the director of the torrington historical society torringford as the neighborhood around gaylord lane has been known since the 1750 's has traditionally been the city 's agricultural center from the time it was first settled by the english until the 1950 's it was exclusively agricultural mr mceachern said but since then it has become increasingly suburbanized and residential there 's not much farming around there anymore joseph ruwet is one of the few who still tills the land in torringford growing fruits and vegetables from his farm on torringford street just one quarter mile north of gaylord lane mr ruwet 84 used to own a field on the other side of gaylord lane and can remember taking teams of horses along the road to get to it there was a lovely apple orchard on the south side mr ruwet recalls it would be a shame for the city to let it go i 'm absolutely opposed to letting it go and for no one in the area does the history of gaylord lane run deeper than for jean gaylord whose family has lived in the colonial house on the south side of the street since 1771 her family once owned all the land surrounding the road and locals soon began calling the bumpy dirt route by the gaylord name ms gaylord said that she had not kept abreast in recent months of the city 's plans for the street but ms gaylord like many others in this tight knit community hopes that change does not come too quickly or too drastically to little gaylord lane it 's always been like this i have a lot of memories attached to this road she said
