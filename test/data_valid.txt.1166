when the new york state board of regents voted last week to delay holding all students to higher standards for at least two more years they portrayed it as a simple mid course correction that was to be expected but the deeper question for new york is whether it will ever be possible to hold all students to an elevated standard the same for everyone and whether it even makes sense to have such a system the board 's most recent actions prompted by an outcry over faulty state regents tests illustrate some of the difficulties attached to such an approach some more easily solved than others an independent panel examining the state 's math a exam in june which 63 percent of the students failed concluded that the test itself was badly flawed they said that if the state uses make or break tests then it must spend the money to get them right in the same vein the panel found that albany officials had raised standards but never made the curriculum clear or invested enough in training teachers there are a lot of things that need a lot of attention fairly quickly to make sure the system serves the needs of the kids said william brosnan chairman of the review panel and superintendent of schools for the northport east northport school district on long island but critics of the standards based approach say there are other problems too some students will never reach the same academic level and the one size fits all approach is just not fair they say the question is how are these kids who end up leaving school without a diploma either because they have failed a test several times or because they have been pushed out better off said robert a schaeffer public education director of fairtest an advocacy group that is critical of standardized testing and how is society better off if they ca n't get a job because they do n't have a diploma on the surface the idea of guaranteeing that all students receive the same high quality education is attractive many states have embraced the standards based approach that new york is using which calls for statewide learning goals and statewide testing the federal no child left behind act passed in 2001 gave further momentum to the movement with annual testing and penalties and remedies for schools and children that failed to meet standards but as much of the country is carried along by this movement there are growing concerns that the pendulum has swung too far robert l linn a university of colorado professor and co director of the center for research on evaluation standards and student testing who has served as an adviser to new york 's department of education expressed some of the mixed reactions to the standards approach when he said nobody can argue against no child left behind because how can you say that you should leave some children behind but it is also nuts to say that it is possible to bring everybody to the same level you can say that your goal is to have everyone run a mile in under five minutes but do you really believe that it can be accomplished i do n't new york used to issue different diplomas for students at different levels only the top students who took the toughest regents exams got the prestigious regents diploma it was not until 1996 that the regents made the exams a condition of high school graduation for everyone recognizing that many students did not have the preparation to pass the tests immediately the regents phased in their requirements they started with one exam and a passing score of 55 for school districts that thought 65 would be too tough which was most and aimed for five exams english math american history world history and a science and a passing score of 65 students with disabilities entering high school in 2004 or earlier would be allowed to earn alternate diplomas if they could not pass the regents last week the regents pulled back on four fronts students will be allowed to pass the exams with scores of 55 rather than 65 for at least two more years the safety net for students with disabilities will be extended by five years the physics standard will be pared back to an entry level course and math will be totally revamped the curriculum will be simplified and spelled out more clearly the test will be made easier and teacher training will be improved some children are going to need more time to get to full achievement said richard p mills the state education commissioner what tripped up new york was the same thing that is tripping up many other states it is easy to create standards but hard to make sure that teachers and students can meet them not surprisingly the biggest problems in new york lie in its cities which have problems attracting and keeping good teachers and where large numbers of students many of them poor and minority are not yet scoring 65 on their exams mr mills said setting goals and administering tests produces results that are far better than many people expect there are opponents who have opposed this effort from the beginning who claim that the regents are willing to let large numbers of children fail he said as you can see they are not but the regents are still struggling with how to keep the number of failures down last week some expressed support for letting students who fail a test graduate anyway if the average of the scores on their five required exams is 65 or higher it was not a prospect that seemed to please commissioner mills but all he would say was individual regents make many proposals and this is one of the things they 've asked me to report back on
