one day after outlining his lofty budget priorities to congress president bush has delivered the decidedly down to earth numbers in the budget itself they show more than ever that mr bush 's tax cut is to be financed by tapping revenues generated by medicare jeopardizing the future solvency of social security and cutting domestic spending programs the precise cuts in housing environment job training transportation law enforcement and other areas were largely hidden even in mr bush 's budget where they were blandly labeled as spending redirections congress must not accept this kind of assault on domestic spending in an era of surpluses it will be up to moderate republicans and democrats in congress to trim down mr bush 's tax cut to a reasonable size that does not distort the budget and introduce renewed risk of deficits if the surpluses are smaller than expected mr bush 's budget of nearly 2 trillion for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 would increase spending in some limited areas as he promised but all the initiatives proposed in the president 's speech tuesday night for schools defense modernization aid to religious institutions and other items amount to less than 15 billion or less than 5 percent of domestic spending outside entitlement programs like social security and medicare indeed he wants to cut spending next year in other domestic programs by over 20 billion which is more than is necessary to pay for his initiatives as mr bush 's aides say any new president is entitled to reorder domestic priorities but congress is obliged to question such priorities and press for more information before acting on either the tax or spending side it was also clear from mr bush 's budget yesterday that he intends to tap revenues from medicare and social security to finance his tax cut and other ideologically driven priorities medicare surpluses are to be set aside in a special reserve fund ostensibly to pay for future medicare changes but they would be available for possible use when other needs arise in addition 600 billion of the social security surplus would be set aside not to make it easier to pay future retirees but to pay for the future establishment of private savings or investment accounts for social security recipients there will be a battle over these accounts in the coming year but it makes no sense to siphon money from the system now to pay for something congress may not accept in the arena of domestic spending cuts mr bush 's budget says in a colossally understated footnote that the final distribution of spending cuts has yet to be determined it is irresponsible for republican leaders in the house to say that they want to pass at least part of mr bush 's tax cut in the next couple of weeks before anyone can look at the spending cuts needed to offset the loss of revenues it will be up to the senate to block this attempt to pre empt a full and reasoned debate on the size and distribution of a tax cut even for a new president mr bush 's financial plan was short on details in 1981 david stockman budget scourge of the reagan era bombarded congress with piles of budget books that laid out precisely where the cuts would take place he created a furor that has become legendary on capitol hill anxious to avoid a repetition mr bush and his budget planners were content yesterday to talk in abstract terms about returning the people 's money to the people but the federal debt is also the people 's as are the domestic programs mr bush would cut what congress must adopt is a budget that allows fairly distributed tax relief that is not so large as to erase vital spending from the budget
