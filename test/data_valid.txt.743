ever since the cendant corporation announced in april 1998 the accounting irregularities that would decimate its stock henry r silverman has been on a crusade to restore his reputation as the deal maker who built hfs inc a huge franchiser of brands like century 21 ramada days inns and avis mr silverman was responsible for the merger with cuc international that created cendant so with the announcement just months after he became chief executive of the combined company it was not only a tremendous blow to cendant 's stock that suffered a tremendous blow so did mr silverman 's standing as a pillar of the business world over the last two years mr silverman has taken a personal as well as professional interest in clearing his name after embarking on a strenuous internal investigation mr silverman has cooperated extensively with regulators and been pointed in his contention that blame for this fraud lies elsewhere his reputation is very precious to him and he wanted to clean it said frederick kobrick a boston money manager who has invested in cendant this effort has pitted mr silverman 's credibility against that of walter a forbes the man who once headed cuc international mr forbes who was originally positioned to run the combined company with mr silverman but who resigned from cendant in july 1998 has previously denied any knowledge of the accounting irregularities yesterday his lawyer would not comment yesterday 's events in which three former senior managers pleaded guilty to criminal charges of fraud and the securities and exchange commission brought charges against seven former managers goes a long way in providing a measure of vindication for mr silverman the regulators contended that senior managers at cuc were responsible for falsifying earnings over more than a decade in a fraud that artificially lifted earnings by more than 500 million in its last three years the announcement does definitely restore a large degree of henry 's excellent reputation as a builder of companies and shareholder value said james citrin an executive recruiter with spencerstuart it also justifies the aggressive stance that he took in dealing with it but analysts agree that mr silverman 's quest to restore his credibility and rebuild cendant is not over the accounting fraud that resulted from the merger with cuc will be the epitaph to silverman 's career said patrick mcgurn director of corporate programs for institutional shareholder services a company based in rockville md that advises large investors on proxy issues in an interview yesterday mr silverman was quick to dismiss any suggestion that he might have or should have known about the fraud when the 1997 merger took place i 'm down 800 million he said i do n't think the height of personal financial masochism could reach that level this is very painful he added personally professionally and financially the outline presented by the securities and exchange commission of the fraud seems to dispel any notion that mr silverman or other hfs managers were involved it enhances credibility said michael millman an analyst at salomon smith barney it makes him a more sympathetic actor in this sordid play investors may be more likely to buy shares in the company now that the taint from the current management team has been removed he said some cendant investors may benefit from the company 's pending 285 billion settlement of a shareholder class action suit last december cendant also received a vote of confidence from john c malone and liberty media which invested 400 million the sec painted a dark portrait of a concerted effort by cuc senior managers including the former chief financial officer who said he was acting at the direction of his superiors to falsify earnings for more than 12 years until its exposure in 1998 certain members of cuc 's senior and middle management devised and operated a systemic systematic scheme to inflate operating income at cuc the scheme was driven by senior management 's determination that cuc would always meet earnings expectations of wall street analysts and fueled by a disregard for any obligation that the earnings reported needed to be 'real the regulators said by contrast the regulators praised cendant 's management for its response to the discovery of accounting problems at cuc cendant management promptly reported the discovery of the fraud and its attendant accounting irregularities to the commission staff conducted a thorough internal investigation and compiled an extensive report the regulators said adding that they also cooperated with staff in its investigation of this matter what is still subject to debate is whether mr silverman should have known that cuc the subject of lengthy accounting travails might be a problematic purchase for an executive who has built fame and fortune as a savvy deal maker mr mcgurn the proxy adviser said to be snookered by fraudsters does beg the question of how good the due diligence was still argued mr kobrick the money manager any such deliberate fraud would be practically impossible to detect regulators also acknowledged that if one co conspirator had not come forward the extent of the fraud might not have been discovered for a long time but mr silverman 's efforts to vindicate himself are clearly not over cendant is trying to force mr forbes to return his 47 million severance package the subject of legal proceedings earlier this month mr forbes paid back 23 million in travel and entertainment expenses which cendant had disputed we intend to pursue that to a conclusion a cendant spokesman said mr silverman would not address the issue of whether he feels personally betrayed by mr forbes i think the court will be the instrument of retribution he said the company has also brought suit against ernst young which mr silverman has publicly argued neglected its responsibilities to uncover the fraud in its long history of auditing cuc ernst young is also suing cendant arguing that its management misled them all of this leaves mr silverman with the continued task of rebuilding cendant the stock which has been hurt in recent months by concerns about the economy and a slowing housing market closed yesterday at 124375 still a far cry from its high of 4169 just before the disclosure mr silverman has put cendant through a wringer shedding 45 billion of businesses not related to its central operations it 's clearly been a distraction for him and the company said greg zappin an analyst at standard poor 's it 's caused them to radically change the business plans the company 's been in a holding pattern ever since mr kobrick for one said he thought yesterday 's events provided a kind of coda to the story of the last two years he 's going to be the most focused guy in the world he said as for his own view mr silverman acknowledged the need to move on we need closure he said this is the beginning of the end of closure
