to the editor you write about workers who can not afford to take early retirement front page feb 26 but there are also workers mostly women who can not afford to retire even at age 70 yet current law forces them to begin withdrawals from their individual retirement accounts after age 70 1 2 thereby making sure that their ira accumulation never reaches an adequate level they are trying to fill a half empty pail with one hand while the government is forcing them to empty it with the other what is the point of forcing people to draw on their ira 's when they do n't need them only to have insufficient funds available when they do need them the law should be changed to permit people to leave their ira 's intact until they retire b g rosenthal new york feb 28 2001
