the applause echoed through the hallways outside the senate chambers last week emanating from a closed door luncheon of republican members it was the sound of self congratulation trent lott the incoming senate majority leader was basking in praise after cutting the deal that sent the bill to create the department of homeland security to the president 's desk but the largest government overhaul in five decades lurks around the corner questions about the new department range from the political who will the president appoint to head its various agencies to the practical how much money does it need from the profound how will it make our nation safer to the mundane where will all these people work instead of congratulating themselves for a job well done members of congress should realize that the work necessary to make the department function has yet to begin although its effect on the federal bureaucracy remains to be seen the new department is already shifting the delicate balance of power among congressional committees currently these committees are neatly organized so the chairmen of these panels become the power brokers for major chunks of the federal government but the buck stops nowhere on capitol hill on homeland security sixty one committees and subcommittees have some domestic security oversight according to an analysis by congressional quarterly representative curt weldon republican of pennsylvania thinks there should be one committee for homeland security but that would require taking power away from other congressional committees one area at least where members of congress will find their power undiminished is in approving the new department 's personnel while tom ridge the current director of homeland security is expected to be the nominee for cabinet secretary he 'll have plenty of underlings appointed by the president the homeland security bill calls for a total of 20 other presidential appointees who would require senate confirmation including a deputy secretary five undersecretaries and up to 12 assistant secretaries congress must also approve the new department 's budget except for the defense budget however congress was unable to pass the most basic appropriations bills before it adjourned for the year and it 's not clear how it will handle budgeting for the new department these delays in appropriations have put some antiterrorism programs on hold including 35 billion in grants to local first responders firefighters police departments and emergency services meanwhile of course the new department faces huge management problems among its core responsibilities for example will be the analysis of intelligence but recent investigations have shown that the fbi and cia have enormous cultural and political barriers when it comes to sharing sensitive information especially about terrorist activities now those agencies will be expected to hand over information to a third intelligence agency and possible rival the department of homeland security 's information analysis and infrastructure protection division workers for the border patrol coast guard and customs service who have been brought up with different agency cultures and different missions while controlling the nation 's borders will also have to put aside competitive differences and learn to take up new responsibilities in addition there is the not inconsiderable issue of a headquarters for this far flung department with 22 agencies and more than 170000 workers initially most employees including the new secretary are expected to use existing office space congress approved the new department with broad bipartisan support such continued support will be crucial as congress embarks on what will undoubtedly be its most important task over the next few years ensuring that the department of homeland security works as advertised martin kady ii is a reporter for congressional quarterly 's homeland security web site
