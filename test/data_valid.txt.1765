the meltdown of team new zealand the america 's cup defender continued today when on the third leg of race 4 against the swiss boat alinghi the kiwis mast exploded into a heap of carbon fiber shards the rig failure created a heartbreaking spectacle on the hauraki gulf for the kiwi faithful as team new zealand 's crew struggled to free its yacht from beneath a tangle of metal shrouds flogging sails and debris from the shattered mast alinghi continued around the course to take a 4 0 lead in the five of nine race series team new zealand was trailing alinghi by three boat lengths when the breakdown occurred the race took place in brutal conditions after nine days of delays large swells from a two day storm rolled across the hauraki gulf pounding the yachts on the upwind legs dark clouds hovered over the course and twice during the race squall lines brought rain and heavy winds on leg 3 one of those squalls brought winds packing 26 knot gusts both team new zealand and alinghi took on water and heeled over in the breeze but when they emerged from the gray curtain of rain the yachts were unscathed a few minutes later with winds moderating to 17 knots team new zealand 's bow rose out of the water and then burrowed into an oncoming wave we 're running out of things to break said dean barker the team new zealand skipper we did n't really expect to be racing in 28 to 29 knots in the america 's cup it 's always hard with new boats to know how hard to push them the sudden deceleration of the yacht increased loads on the mast by up to 25 percent said scott vogel an american mast designer who was watching the race vogel said the loads on an america 's cup yacht mast can approach 145000 pounds the mast broke about 30 feet from the deck sending a violent shudder through the yacht and causing the crew to duck for cover the huge mainsail crashed into the sea as the headsail went streaming to leeward the kiwis were out of the race tom schnackenberg the head of team new zealand was watching the race from a nearby spectator craft the boat was definitely bouncing he said i thought something 's got to give and something did it 's a very unfortunate thing russell coutts the alinghi skipper took in the kiwi breakdown by saying i 'm a little bit surprised but pleasantly surprised ernesto bertarelli the swiss billionaire behind alinghi and the team 's navigator expressed surprise as well we 'd heard so much about the design team and the speed of their boat he said if we have the same conditions tomorrow i 'm pretty confident schnackenberg said his crew members would work hard overnight to fix the yacht we 'll be ready to race tomorrow schnackenberg said there are no lives left we have to win each race the kiwis have now had to bail out of two races in the series because of gear failure in race 1 on feb 15 after its boat was swamped with water team new zealand 's boom broke minutes later the headsail tore forcing barker to withdraw the kiwis will have tonight to replace their mast with a spare probably the one in nzl 81 the team 's backup boat racing is scheduled for saturday in lighter winds around 10 knots there 's a lot of work to do barker said it 'll be a pretty late night it was another day when nothing seemed to go right for the young kiwi team team new zealand lost the start to alinghi and quickly found itself trailing by a boat length on the first leg to fend off the water that surged over the boat 's lower rail in the first race the kiwis had fitted their high tech yacht with barriers of tape and plastic sheeting on the aft section but early in today 's race the problem for the kiwis was not water but wind the heavy breeze was overpowering their mainsail causing the sail to bubble or lose its shape near the mast alinghi meanwhile seemed ready for the wind the swiss boat 's sails held their shape perfectly and sailing side by side with the kiwis alinghi made gains up the first leg alinghi rounded the first mark eight seconds ahead the downwind conditions were perfect for the kiwis celebrated hula short for hull appendage the 20 foot carbon fiber extension beneath the yacht that is supposed to extend its waterline and increase its speed but reaching down the course in a stiff breeze of 22 knots alinghi pulled away to round the second mark 17 seconds ahead for the fourth race in a row the hula failed to give team new zealand the edge its designers had hoped for
