to the editor re stresses of day care letter july 19 i wonder whether the university of minnesota researchers who linked behavioral problems to child care followed the shy children who stayed at home until they entered a full time educational setting if they also experienced higher levels of cortisol a stress hormone when they entered a full day program perhaps the issue is not whether the children should be in day care but whether greater sensitivity by teachers and caregivers would mitigate the stress of a group setting regardless of the age of entry joan f peters brooklyn july 21 2003
