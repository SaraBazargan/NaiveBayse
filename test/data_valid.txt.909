vinny testaverde has made this throw a million times in 16 seasons a simple toss in another drill in an early training camp practice but this morning in the jets fifth preseason practice testaverde 's throwing hand met an offensive lineman 's helmet spraining his right thumb and spinning the immediate future of the jets quarterback situation into doubt tests showed no breaks or ligament damage but testaverde 38 was expected to be examined tonight by kenneth montgomery the team 's associate orthopedist the jets did not give a timetable for his return but testaverde will be out at least a few days one to two weeks seems more likely and he opened the possibility that it could be much longer i jammed it pretty good testaverde said i do n't know when i 'll be back out there at practice again i 've jammed my thumb before it 's usually just a couple of weeks if that i do n't expect to miss too much time i certainly expect to be back for the opening of the regular season just the mention of the regular season is alarming for the jets and if testaverde 's injury does not fully heal it could hinder him throughout the season coach herman edwards exercises extreme caution with veteran players during training camp so it seems unlikely that testaverde will play in the preseason opener at pittsburgh on aug 8 when he was scheduled to take no more than a dozen snaps we 're going to be very very cautious with him edwards said it 's sore right now the jets open the season sept 8 at buffalo testaverde said that if he had been injured during a regular season game he would probably have continued to play on the surface this does not seem to be serious setback because it is early in training camp but testaverde needs to practice because he did not participate in minicamp in april and he worked in only the final two days of the passing camp in june while recovering from march surgery to remove a benign tumor in his right foot he admitted that he had been rusty in the first two days of training camp testaverde 's unavailability underscores the fact that chad pennington is only an injury away from being the full time quarterback pennington who threw only 20 passes in garbage time last season gained confidence from a strong series of practices during the off season program he took all the snaps with the first team while testaverde was out and was expected to get plenty of playing time with the first team during the preseason even before testaverde 's injury but now pennington 's readiness to lead the offense becomes a more pressing matter the spring gave me an extra amount of confidence pennington said now i feel confident i can run the show just having one quarterback on your team is not going to get it done offensively our guys believe in me and know i can do the job testaverde wants to play it safe citing st louis quarterback kurt warner as an example warner sprained a ligament in his thumb when he hit it against a helmet in the season opener last year the injury troubled him throughout the season and warner said it affected his ability to throw after not throwing a ball for more than three months warner is finally pain free it nagged him all year testaverde said of warner 's injury i do n't want to have this nag me throughout the season if i have a chance to let it heal completely now testaverde conceded that if the decision were his alone he would probably return to practice in a few days but edwards and the team doctors might have other ideas testaverde compared the injury to the annoyance of a paper cut once it is there it seems to always get hit again that is particularly true of the quarterback whose hands are under center and are hit repeatedly when the ball is snapped testaverde sustained the injury during team drills as he threw a pass and an unidentified offensive lineman was pushed toward him by the pass rush testaverde 's hand banged the player 's helmet at first it hurt so badly that testaverde thought the thumb might have popped out of its socket he did not take another snap and trainers immediately wrapped his thumb in ice any time you miss time during camp it ca n't be good testaverde said i 'd rather have a little setback during camp than during the regular season i probably think i could be back in a couple days but we 're in camp and this is a time when i can let it heal and i do n't have to rush back testaverde has not missed a start in the two seasons since he returned from an achilles tendon tear that wiped out his 1999 season he had a turf toe and a pinched nerve in his shoulder in 2000 before the bone tumor in his foot this year the thumb is yet another body part to tend to in the trainer 's room after some of the stuff i 've been through this is probably not worth the ink you 're going to use to write the story testaverde said extra points in addition to center kevin mawae shoulder and vinny testaverde thumb four other starters missed practice on tuesday guard randy thomas shoulder linebacker sam cowart hamstring linebacker marvin jones stiff back and receiver laveranues coles heel the jets are so thin at guard david viger has a calf injury and j p machado is playing center in mawae 's absence that the backup tight end james dearth had to play guard but coach herman edwards said the jets would wait before deciding whether to sign another offensive lineman the jets waived receiver brian scott and offensive tackle mike curry from hofstra and signed jerris evans a 5 foot 11 187 pound receiver from missouri western state college the jets will practice at 7 30 pm wednesday for family night at the mitchel field athletic complex in uniondale ny
