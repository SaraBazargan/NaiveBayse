boy do i have a bone to pick the worst homework assignment that i had to do was not actually mine but my daughter 's three years ago when she was in the fifth grade my daughter was given the optional project of reconstructing the skeleton of a real chicken head to foot since this was the infamous class project of a veteran teacher it was really not optional at all the project entailed the procurement of a fresh chicken with the head and feet intact and then boiling away the flesh to leave all of the bones clean this became a family effort with my husband boiling the chicken cleaning and drying the bones and hot gluing the bones back together in the proper structure the next step was to depict this skeleton in an amusing and creative display we borrowed a bed from barbie covered the bones with red marker dots and laid this sick chick out to create chicken pox now i ask you to please tell me what we learned from this chicken assignment that i would much rather eat one that glue one what 10 year old could possibly be responsible for boiling and hot gluing hundreds of chicken bones on his or her own i guess we worked together as a team and commiserated through our complaints but honestly i would have preferred to have just chickened out on this one lori glass citak great neck
