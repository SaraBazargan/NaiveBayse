the ferocious six month struggle between hewlett packard 's management and its founding families for the hearts and minds of 900000 shareholders was unprecedented in many ways so it should come as no surprise that tuesday 's shareholder vote turned out to be a cliffhanger more befitting a political race than a corporate proxy contest it will take weeks to count the votes but carleton fiorina the chief executive officer brought in three years ago to revitalize the silicon valley icon appears to have won shareholder approval by the narrowest of margins for a 21 billion acquisition of compaq the computer maker now comes the hard part for ms fiorina besides overseeing the daunting integration of the two high tech companies she must address the dissension within h p 's proud ranks most employee shareholders may have voted against the deal taking their cue from walter hewlett the dissident director who led and underwrote the unusual shareholder revolt against management 's plans there is an immediate bold step ms fiorina and her board of directors could take to reduce the acrimony and encourage investor confidence in the combined entity 's prospects that is to abandon any plans of turning the deal 's closing into a financial windfall for top executives at h p and compaq in opposing the deal mr hewlett rightly protested proposals to grant ms fiorina and michael capellas compaq 's chief executive who will now become h p 's chief operating officer as much as a combined 115 million in post deal compensation h p has said no such package was approved and that mr hewlett a member of the board 's compensation committee is well aware of that fact outrageous executive compensation schemes became the norm during the recent financial bubble but in the aftermath of the enron and global crossing collapses when shareholders were wiped out after executives cashed in hundreds of millions it became apparent that corporate america faces an epidemic of greed that threatens its integrity stock options and other incentive packages once promoted to align managers interests with those of shareholders have been distorted to a point where top managers are extravagantly rewarded regardless of their performance a huge merger payoff would look like an insurance policy to cover compaq and h p executives in case their merger does not work out as well as they have promised shareholders who backed ms fiorina 's vision and approved the merger have no such insurance they 've put their money where her mouth is so should she as for this merger 's merits there was a grain of truth in the core arguments on both sides mr hewlett rightly pointed out that selling personal computers compaq 's bread and butter is an increasingly low margin commodity business and that most past mergers between tech companies have not been successful for her part ms fiorina convinced a majority of institutional shareholders that h p could not stand still and stick to its lucrative printing business in a rapidly changing tech sector where many once prosperous businesses have perished managers may sometimes have to bet the company in an effort to adapt and survive still in defeat mr hewlett who was unfairly dismissed by management as a musician and an academic has unexpectedly reawakened a sense of shareholder activism in corporate america shareholders elsewhere ought to follow his lead in holding managers and directors accountable especially on issues like excessive executive compensation
