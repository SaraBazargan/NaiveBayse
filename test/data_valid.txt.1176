to the editor i am trying to imagine why robert b reich is urging graduates to get a job op ed may 19 when i received my bachelor 's degree in 1994 just after another george bush was president and the job market was similarly bad i decided to go to graduate school i am now a phd with a good job in research i learned more about myself and worked harder in graduate school than i did while working as a laborer in industrial mills or in fast food restaurants while there are plenty of people fighting for the gofer jobs far too few americans are getting advanced degrees this is especially true for advanced science and engineering degrees even though one 's continuing education is often financed through research and teaching assistantships not loans besides an advanced education can be an end unto itself stephen cumblidge richland wash may 19 2003
