asian long horned beetles which have destroyed nearly 3000 trees in new york city since their first appearance in the greenpoint section of brooklyn four years ago have invaded the trees that line luther gulick playground near the manhattan approach to the williamsburg bridge parks commissioner henry j stern said yesterday the infected trees at least six of the park 's 34 norway maples will be removed beginning tomorrow he said the beetles pose an enormous long term danger to the city 's forests and to trees all along the northeast mr stern said all of humanity is together in fighting this this is biological warfare and we are on the side of the trees the parks department learned of the infestation when inspectors found pencil sized holes made by the burrowing beetles in the tree 's trunks mr stern said the insects make the holes to bury their eggs the larvae hatch in the spring and tunnel into the trees feed on the wood and destroy the trees because the beetles have no natural predators in the united states the only way to stop the spread of the insect is to chop down infected trees then chip and burn them to destroy both the beetle and its eggs mr stern said in april the parks department announced a major effort to fight the long horned beetle with more than 10 million more than ever before in city state and federal money budgeted to inspect trees cut down those that show evidence of an infestation and replace them with seedlings the parks department suspects that the beetle responsible for the destruction of a huge expanse of forest in china hitched a ride to the united states on imported crates landing at the docks in greenpoint the parks department has been intensifying inspection in specially zoned areas surrounding sites of previous infestation like the upper and eastern part of manhattan and nearly all of brooklyn and queens because of the discovery of the beetle infestation in lower manhattan the inspectors are expected to concentrate their efforts in that area
