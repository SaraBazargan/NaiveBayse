to the editor how appropriate that your dec 28 news article about new york city police officer recruitment problems appeared on the same day as the one about mayor rudolph w giuliani 's farewell address touting the successes of his administration while the city as a whole may have prospered during mr giuliani 's tenure our vital city employees like our police officers and teachers have not mr giuliani has done little to raise these employees salaries which drastically trail those in the suburbs and make recruitment far more difficult nor has he explained how the city can expect to compete for high quality employees when much higher pay is available just a short distance away of course the mayor should oversee the budget in a responsible manner but it was irresponsible for him to fail to address these festering problems during a time of economic prosperity and then literally to pass the buck to the next administration daniel a simon new york dec 30 2001
