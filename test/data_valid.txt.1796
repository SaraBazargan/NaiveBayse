as both sides left genoa the leaders of the major industrialized nations who met here and the mainstream protest leaders began reflecting today on how to carry out their goals while avoiding the fatal violence that marred this year 's meeting about all they agreed upon was never again it 's a real time for reflection and i think no one knows the answers said lucy matthew the spokeswoman drop the debt a group that promotes debt relief for poorer nations the leaders of the group of 8 nations took the first step toward change announcing that next year 's summit meeting will be in a remote canadian resort and that they hope to limit the number of those taking part to 350 down from 2000 for the leaders of the tens of thousands of demonstrators who came to protest here as they had at similar gatherings in the last two years in seattle and canada sweden and france the process of reflection promised to be far more wrenching for those who came determined to demonstrate peacefully the question was how to isolate the radical anarchists who sullied their message by provoking fighting that wounded dozens of demonstrators and the killing of one protester by the police a few protest leaders accused the police in italy and elsewhere in europe of wittingly or unwittingly sabotaging the peaceful demonstration by failing to isolate and arrest the easily identifiable anarchists but for most others the issue was whether nonviolent organizations had gone far enough to distance themselves from the others it 's a sad weekend ms matthew said as she prepared to leave genoa she said leaders of her organization met on friday after a 23 year old italian protester carlo giuliani was killed and decided to withdraw their followers from the demonstration on saturday it was purely a safety issue for us she said organizers had expected more than 100000 to march on saturday in the largest protest of the three days of meetings after the violence on friday only about 50000 joined the saturday march which also produced attacks on the police who responded with tear gas and beatings carlo angeli a 21 year old anthropology student from siena italy said about 40 siena members of italy 's hard line communist faction which opposed violence were supposed to come to genoa but only he and a companion came after news spread of the violence on friday like many demonstrators mr angeli said he had come to genoa to protest globalization 's effects in countries like italy it destroys communities he said a 33 year old leader of an environmental group from the italian island of sardinia who identified himself only by a nom de guerre dr drer sounded the same theme he said he had come to protest the destruction of age old villages and the industrialization of agriculture on the island they have replaced wine and rice with other fruits he complained people are being forced out of villages and into residential settlements that are neither villages nor towns they are not communities some demonstrators lamented the destruction of carefully assembled coalitions as a result of the violence maria teresa gennari an office worker in her 30 's said she had traveled to genoa with 20 other women the youngest 20 the oldest 60 from a feminist organization in rome women in general we are a movement that includes nuns grandmothers radical feminists and it was the first time we found common ground she said this coalition they blew to pieces ms gennari echoed other marchers in accusing the police of helping to discredit the protests by failing to stop the radical anarchists for many what was supposed to have been an exercise in idealism turned into a nightmare ms gennari said she and her companions had visited the headquarters in a local school of the genoa social forum a group committed to nonviolence that had helped organize the marches early on sunday the police raided the school contending that they were searching for weapons leaders of the organization accused the police of indiscriminately beating its leaders and marchers who used the school as a dormitory ms gennari said she had seen the spots of blood on the walls and floors that were left by the beatings other leaders professed helplessness in the face of the anarchists who travel from one demonstration to the next for violent protest we have no contact with them and in some instances we do n't know who they are ms matthew said people are really starting to think how do we deal with these guys to diminish the chance of violence at next year 's meeting prime minister jean chretien of canada the host announced that it would be held in a rocky mountain resort town kananaskis about 50 miles from calgary alberta with high security he added only half jokingly but there is less around it to destroy we are the democratically elected people and it is important for us to meet he said so if the anarchists want to destroy democracy we will not let them succeed to many protesters the levers of power in the world are controlled by political leaders who hold closed meetings by free trade organizations that care little about poor or developing countries and by banks and corporations whose principal goal is to enrich their shareholders some leaders stressed that countering such misconceptions would involve increased consultations with private groups known as nongovernmental organizations many of which are behind the regular protests president jacques chirac of france called for regular natural and permanent consultations with those groups to discuss and take the necessary steps to assure progress other leaders rejected widening the consultative process fearing a dilution of the personal contacts between the leaders it 's a question primarily of the leaders discussing with each other that 's a very important element said alfred tacke an aide to chancellor gerhard schroder of germany the protesters will always be there
