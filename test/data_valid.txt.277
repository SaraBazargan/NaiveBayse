with natural gas prices at an all time high and americans facing power shortages in some states president elect george w bush 's plans for an energy policy have started to receive close scrutiny his most controversial idea during the campaign opening alaskan wilderness to drilling has enraged environmental advocates and debate over the drilling has overshadowed other ideas mr bush is considering that could have much wider impacts on energy supplies and the environment mr bush has never presented much of a detailed plan some in the energy industry hope he will take specific steps to open federal land in the lower 48 states for energy exploration particularly for natural gas industry officials said they also expected him to take steps to rejuvenate coal and nuclear power while considering ways to curb the environmental protection agency and other agencies making it easier for energy companies to build power plants refineries natural gas pipelines and transmission lines stimulating natural gas production is probably the no 1 thing on his energy agenda a bush adviser said in his visit with congressional leaders this week in washington mr bush emphasized energy as well as tax cuts we must be concerned about shortages and at the same time obviously concerned about conservation he said on monday mr bush did not talk about specific pieces of energy legislation in the meetings but once in office ari fleischer the bush transition spokesman said he plans to direct the energy department to review federal lands currently off limits for drilling officials cite projections that such land could contain up to 137 trillion cubic feet of natural gas enough to supply the united states for six years robert j allison jr chairman and chief executive of the anadarko petroleum corporation in houston said a lot of federal lands are off limits in a way that does n't make sense and that can be developed in an environmentally friendly way the most important thing mr allison said is that we have access to places to drill natural gas fuels more than 90 percent of the nation 's new electric power generation plants this year high prices and low supplies have contributed to the threatened blackouts and high power prices in california and other western states oil and gas companies want to drill on millions of acres of federally protected lands in the rocky mountains and there are significant deposits of natural gas and to a lesser extent oil off the northern coast of california the carolinas florida and new england mr bush has promised to oppose new drilling in the outer continental shelf of states that object like california and florida said senator john b breaux democrat of louisiana who met with mr bush in austin tex last week and for a time had been considered a candidate for energy secretary the impression i have from talking to mr bush mr breaux said is that he feels we do not have a national energy policy that is focused on developing our domestic resources he wants to move in a lot of areas but some industry experts say it would be wrong to place too emphasis on finding gas and oil lawrence goldstein president of the petroleum industry research foundation said we 're increasingly dependent on a single source of fuel natural gas for power plants and what 's happening in california could be happening in the northeast mr goldstein and other industry officials said that a bush administration might be more willing to focus on nuclear and coal as fuel sources continued high energy prices may improve political support for new gas drilling in some states but winning approval to open 15 million acres of the arctic national wildlife refuge would be difficult should mr bush choose to pursue it republicans on capitol hill said the spike in energy prices had bolstered public opinion toward opening the reserve but they were still not certain congress would approve it industry officials also said mr bush was expected to balance the needs of energy production and the environment more fairly than the clinton administration did but environmental advocates fear he will go too far dan becker of the sierra club in washington said there 's a lot of oil out by santa barbara but do you want to run the risk of ruining the coast of california while you search for it mr fleischer said mr bush would be sensitive to environmental concerns and added we recognize there will be from some an attempt to create controversy but america can not afford to be put through another energy crisis with the problems in california some consumer advocates have talked about re regulating electric utilities and trying to cap natural gas prices but curtis l hebert jr the only republican on the federal energy regulatory commission and a candidate for the chairmanship attributes california 's problems to excessive regulations that stymied construction of power plants new price caps would only discourage construction mr hebert said the 150 per megawatt hour price caps recently instituted in california will come under review again in four months industry analysts said and that may prove a test of the bush administration 's approach to deregulation
