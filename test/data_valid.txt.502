to the sports editor last saturday i watched telecasts of the belmont stakes and the stanley cup finals the actual events took up about half the allotted telecast time the rest was taken by commentators talking with one another four for the belmont and six for the hockey there were also info bites old film clips charts of stats and numbingly repetitive commercials at the belmont these ads were repeated in place of the customary rerun of the tape where we expected to watch how the winner ran the race maddening the most important cost of a sports telecast is for good camera work that expense would be a fraction of what these overproduced extravaganzas require the sports programs would n't need such a list of commercial sponsors and a hockey game would n't take three hours the intermissions would be for discussing the game not for one ad after another is it too much to ask that viewers have 15 uninterrupted minutes to watch the event with one commentator margaret t hollingsworth kennebunkport me
