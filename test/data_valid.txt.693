one winter several years ago i stayed in an inn that was surrounded by cross country ski trails it had a mediocre restaurant which was redeemed by a short underpriced wine list a good bottle of burgundy cost less than the price in the liquor store the food was basic mostly stews done without much flair but when you have skied all day you are ravenously hungry and everything tasted wonderful after dinner we were tucked up in a room with a fireplace fast asleep well before 10 so recently when at long last enough snow fell to make cross country skiing a possibility again my thoughts turned to stew and red wine one night after a day skiing through woods and fields we had osso buco tender chunks of veal falling off the bone the core of which was filled with a delicious marrow we scooped out with a small spoon another evening it was a dark gelatinous oxtail stew with boiled potatoes to sop up the rich gravy it is a good idea to make the stew a day or two ahead of time so you can chill it in the refrigerator and later skim off the fat when there is not enough time to cook a meat stew i braise chicken breasts with tomatoes and black olives it takes less than an hour and we eat them on a heap of buttered noodles as i cooked these stews i realized that they have the same basic ingredients onion carrots garlic celery wine and tomatoes but they taste completely different and when you have been skiing all day there is nothing better chicken with tomatoes pancetta and olives total time 40 minutes 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 boned whole chicken breasts cut into 2 inch chunks 1 4 pound pancetta cut into strips 1 medium onion minced 1 clove garlic minced 3 carrots chopped 1 cup dry white wine 1 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves 2 cups chopped canned tomatoes with their juice 1 2 cup black olives pitted coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 1 heat the olive oil in a large skillet and brown the chicken pieces a few at a time set them aside on a plate 2 add the pancetta and cook until browned remove with a slotted spoon to a plate add the onion garlic and carrots brown them lightly and pour off the excess fat 3 add the wine stir well and bring to a boil return the pancetta to the pan with the thyme tomatoes and olives turn down the heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes 4 empty the chicken pieces with their juices into the pan and cook for about five minutes or until they are cooked through season to taste with salt and pepper and serve yield 4 servings note serve this with rice or pasta osso buco total time 3 hours 3 tablespoons olive oil 4 veal shanks flour for dredging coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 1 medium onion chopped 2 cloves garlic minced 4 carrots chopped 4 stalks celery chopped 1 cup dry white wine 3 strips lemon peel 1 tablespoon thyme 3 cups canned tomatoes with their juice approximately 1 cup strong chicken stock 1 preheat the oven to 375 degrees heat the olive oil in a large flameproof casserole with a lid big enough to hold the shanks in one layer dredge the shanks lightly in flour and brown them on both sides remove them from the pan and set them aside on a plate season them to taste with salt and pepper 2 add the onion garlic carrots and celery cook for five minutes or until lightly browned deglaze with the wine scraping up any bits that are sticking to the bottom of the pan 3 return the shanks to the pan with the lemon peel thyme and tomatoes and enough stock just to cover them bring to a boil cover and bake in the oven for two hours or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone correct seasoning and serve yield 4 servings note this is traditionally served with saffron flavored risotto oxtail stew total time 3 hours 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 4 pound pancetta cut in strips 5 pounds oxtails cut in 2 inch pieces flour for dredging coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 1 medium onion chopped 2 cloves garlic minced 2 carrots sliced 6 stalks celery chopped 3 cups dry red wine 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves 1 28 ounce can of tomatoes chopped with their juice 1 preheat the oven to 350 degrees heat the olive oil and pancetta in a large flameproof casserole with a lid brown the pancetta and remove it with a slotted spoon to a plate 2 dredge the oxtails in flour and brown the pieces without crowding do this in batches season with salt and pepper and remove to a platter 3 add the onion garlic carrots and celery and cook for five minutes add the wine and stir well to scrape up any bits that may have adhered to the the pan bring to a boil and add the rosemary and tomatoes stir and return the oxtail pieces and pancetta to the pan cover and braise in the oven for two and a half hours or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone turning the meat two or three times correct seasoning and serve yield 4 servings note serve this with boiled potatoes
