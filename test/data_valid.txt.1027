maybe it 's the site on cleveland place near kenmare street one of those timeless places in downtown manhattan where the year could just as easily be 1925 as 2000 or maybe it 's the name va tutto italian for anything goes complete with punctuation that demands you take heed either way daydreaming comes easily at this warm and welcoming tuscan oriented restaurant especially when it 's 70 degrees in early march and a lovely garden looms invitingly through the open doors at the rear of the dining room the garden is not really ready for dining i 'm told yet two young women in tank tops are enjoying lunch in the open air and another couple middle aged are clinking glasses with a bottle of chilled white wine at hand as i gaze in their direction the mediterranean blue wall in the rear of the garden seems to liquefy mir agelike into a bobbing sea and the bare white trellises arching over the outdoor tables are engulfed in vines thick with plump black grapes i tear my attention from the garden and turn to the panini povero on my plate a sumptuous sandwich of scrambled eggs mozzarella tomato sauce and herbs that somehow holds together on crusty grilled bread 750 on the side is a green salad with tomatoes impossibly sweet for march though i 'm sure i 'm not imagining the flavor day or night i 'm taken with the restaurant 's warm ambience and the relaxed yet passionate italian cooking the chef maria giordano lupo who once cooked at gotham bar and grill has put together an easy to enjoy menu that suggests tuscany but is n't overly zealous about it va tutto you know the panini was from the lunch menu i had gone for a pizza only to learn that the wood burning oven is not fired up at lunch i left happy nonetheless though i still have n't tried the pizza luckily i have tried the grilled calamari 850 barely crisp around the edges with moist polenta spiked with gorgonzola and greens it is an excellent presentation like the calamari grilled quail 850 is a careful composition of flavors textures and colors the savory bird is surrounded by sweet fennel greens and juicy orange sections the insalata di funghi 850 blends tender greens with earthy mushrooms more sweet fennel salty pecorino cheese all perfectly dressed with a touch of truffle oil among the appetizers only the sodden fritti misti 8 the italian version of vegetable tempura lagged my favorite main courses were the pastas al forno baked dishes like a thin wedge of lasagna with fennel sausage roasted peppers and plum tomatoes 16 and sumptuous cannelloni stuffed with spinach mushrooms and parmesan 15 i also liked ribbons of pasta with speck an excellent ham from the alto adige roasted tomatoes peas and garlic 14 and rigatoni amatriciana 14 a traditional dish of tomatoes onions pancetta and red pepper i skipped the wood grilled t bone steak 23 the most expensive item on the menu but the wood roasted chicken 16 was juicy and lemony and altogether winning with a big dollop of that polenta the wine list is modest but offers some good bottles from the northern italian regions more worthy of pondering is the dessert list how for example can a simple combination of house made focaccia lathered with nutella that european chocolate hazelnut spread 750 be so satisfying maybe it 's the scoop of rich fig flavored gelato that comes with it soft chocolate bread pudding 750 is galvanized by dried cherries and a scoop of hazelnut gelato and va tutto offers the rare panna cotta 650 in which flavor triumphs over texture and no it was n't my imagination va tutto 23 cleveland place near kenmare street nolita 212 941 0286 best dishes panini povero grilled calamari grilled quail insalata di funghi lasagna with fennel sausage cannelloni pasta with speck roasted tomatoes and peas rigatoni amatriciana wood grilled chicken focaccia with nutella chocolate bread pudding panna cotta price range appetizers 650 to 950 main courses 13 to 23 credit cards all major cards hours tuesday through thursday noon to 3 pm 6 to 10 30 pm friday noon to 3 pm 6 to 11 pm saturday 6 to 11 pm sunday 6 to 10 30 pm closed monday wheelchair access steps to the garden everything else on one level
