to ensure that its disapproval of the conference on democracy organized here by the united states is officially noticed france declined today to accept the document summarizing the principles and agreed to by other participants in a tart one page statement the french said that the document agreed to by more than 100 nations should not be interpreted as a political commitment for the participants to act as a group for the furthering of democracy the disavowal came one day after the french foreign minister hubert vedrine discussed his philosophy about democracy with american reporters and suggested that it was misguided to believe that democracy could be imposed democracy he said was most often a slow growing process that grew from within a country elaborating on mr vedrine 's discussion the statement issued by the french embassy said that spreading democracy was not a matter which allows sweeping generalizations it added the specifics of each case should be taken into consideration the statement threw faint praise on the exercise a gathering of foreign ministers and some well known human rights figures orchestrated by the state department saying it had provided a good exchange of ideas but the french insisted that the meeting should be regarded as merely the beginning for such an exchange not as a program for action the american delegation headed by secretary of state madeleine k albright was taken aback by the french objections for france the conference presented a perfect opportunity to puncture what they saw as another illustration of pax americana in the scale of things the meeting was not a big deal even though it involved more than 100 countries it was a state department driven affair and the french saw a chance to use their polish friends to take a shot at the united states whom mr vedrine has called the hyperpower more seriously in terms of democratic values france has taken a much tougher line than the clinton administration against moscow 's actions in chechyna and criticized the new russian president vladimir v putin for his pursuit of the war there for their more aggressive stance on chechyna the french have been scorned by mr putin who made his first european visit to germany this month by taking exception to the democracy conference mr vedrine purposely or not was taking aim at the heart of what dr albright hopes will be a large part of her legacy the conference was conceived by one of dr albright 's senior aides morton h halperin as a way of highlighting the spread of democracy since the end of of the cold war and enshrining the united states as its leading light a few hours after mr vedrine spoke to american reporters on monday the american embassy called the french embassy asking for a transcript of the foreign minister 's remarks since mr vedrine had spoken informally at the french embassy residence here a transcript was not available a french official said state department officials made clear in the days before the conference that the countries represented here had made their attendance contingent on accepting the democracy document known as the warsaw declaration the wording of the declaration was circulated to invitees well before the meeting they said the document says that democratic governments may vary in many respects but are the same in important respects the common aspects include free and fair elections equal treatment under the law respect for religion and the press and freedom from torture and arbitrary arrest the document notes that opposition political parties and trade unions have the right to organize the official disavowal of the declaration was organized quietly between the french government and the poles who were the hosts some days ago the french government asked the polish foreign minister bronislaw geremek not to include france among the countries who agreed to the declaration a french official said this morning at the final session at the polish parliament delegates found a piece of paper on their desks listing the countries that had signed on to the warsaw declaration france was conspicuously absent state department officials said the french position was based on a misconception the conference they said was not intended to start a movement to convert nondemocratic countries but rather to strengthen democratic practices
