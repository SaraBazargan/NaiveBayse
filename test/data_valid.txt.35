he never played on the high school varsity he did not play division iii college basketball until he was 24 years old and even now after averaging 272 points a game this season horace jenkins is not widely known beyond the confines of the gym at william paterson university but national basketball association scouts know all about the 26 year old jenkins a 6 foot 1 inch point guard who is extremely quick has a 44 inch vertical leap and can drive the lane or hit from outside with equal facility more than a few nba players and college stars are familiar with jenkins too in the jersey shore summer league duke 's point guard jason williams dueled with jenkins last summer williams perhaps the premier college player at his position was outscored by jenkins 49 30 rick brunson of the knicks faced jenkins in the same league two years ago along with brunson 's summer teammates eddie jones and anthony mason both of the miami heat jenkins brought the crowd to its feet in the tiny st rose high school gym in belmar nj scoring 38 points i did n't know who he was brunson recalled recently but after the game i took him aside and told him 'do n't worry about division iii or anything like that if you 're good enough they 'll find you if you ask me i 'd say yes he can play in the nba he 's got the quickness of allen iverson the shooting ability of stephon marbury and he can dunk on just about anybody he can do it all from what i 've seen if i was a scout he 'd be on my short list many scouts have been following jenkins lately as he and his teammates make their way through the ncaa division iii tournament william paterson 23 4 faces mcmurry university of abilene tex tonight in the round of 16 in newport news va on the day the pioneers began their postseason push last week jenkins received an invitation to attend the portsmouth invitational camp this spring the first of three camps for prospects before the nba draft it means a whole lot jenkins said of the invitation i look at what i went through all my life to get to this point to get this opportunity that i 've always been waiting for and i feel i 'm getting kind of a second chance at life just a few years ago it would have been hard to imagine a less likely candidate for professional basketball either in the nba or in europe jenkins did not play high school ball having coasted through elizabeth high school with just enough effort to graduate but never enough to be eligible to play on the school 's highly regarded team after he played one season of junior college basketball at union county college his grades became a problem his son hakeem was born and he walked away from the game jenkins worked as an electrician and on the back of a garbage truck he had responsibilities to tend to a son to feed and the money he earned was enough to pay the bills and squelch his childhood dreams but he still played ball in the playgrounds after work on the courts at newark 's branch brook park he found the dream once again i played every day and i got criticized from every angle jenkins said there were people telling me 'you 've got too much talent you do n't want to be a neighborhood star it kind of bothered me in a sense i was lost they were giving me constructive criticism but i was working and i was kind of making ends meet i had a son i was trying to be a responsible father then my mother had a long talk with me and i sat and listened and it really helped me realize i never even gave it a shot i walked away from the opportunity that was there the obstacles were easy to see but so was the raw talent jose rebimbas the head coach at william paterson discovered jenkins in branch brook park one summer evening having come to watch muffeed thomas an incoming freshman who had committed to play for the pioneers rebimbas could not take his eyes off the slightly built point guard who was scoring from all angles after watching him play for three quarters i went to muffeed and said 'who 's this kid rebimbas recalled he said 'he 's your starting point guard next year he said that horace really wanted to come so after the game i gave him my business card and said 'listen i hear you 're interested in going to school you 're obviously a wonderful player but i 've been down this road before and i 'm only going to do this if you want to do this while jenkins convinced rebimbas that he truly wanted to play basketball the coach was not easily convinced that jenkins could withstand the rigors of a college classroom or of college basketball even though he was 24 years old this kid was a kid rebimbas said we would n't let 24 hours go by without communicating after tough losses his first year i did n't know how he would be able to deal with it so we 'd talk after good wins we 'd talk i always understood that we had to be there for him to keep pushing him up the ladder that we had set for him jenkins who is as proud of his 27 grade point average as he is of his scoring average is on course to graduate in december if he is drafted or gets the chance to try out for a professional team jenkins said he might postpone his last semester of course work to get that opportunity means so much to me he said of his basketball future because i 've worked so hard to get to this point
