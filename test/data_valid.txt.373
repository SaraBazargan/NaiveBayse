when the nets gathered for a workout today the mood was still a little bit the way it was when they had left continental arena on friday night frustrated and disappointed with the result of that night 's game as well as the realization that their playoff hopes had likely disappeared coach don casey did not pull out any motivational speeches he simply gave the floor to the team 's video coordinator and statistician brendan brown who showed the players the schedules of the teams that they were chasing in the race for the eighth and final playoff berth and explaining how easy it would be for the nets to slip into that spot even from the distance they now sat with the irritating 116 115 overtime loss to the minnesota timberwolves on friday and the orlando magic 's victory over the houston rockets the nets are now four games behind the magic which holds the final spot with 14 games left no matter how they are juggled those numbers are imposing but little more than 12 hours after they were ready to raise the white flag the nets had their sights set on sunday 's game against the denver nuggets and a return to the race i think we made it out to be a big blow to us keith van horn said but the way he put it to us today our hopes are very much alive we do n't need to be down we need to look ahead and the way he put it made it really clear that we are still in this hunt and we just need to keep our focus it was a far different mood from the one the nets were in after friday 's game when their desperate effort fell short then they were united certain that the officials had taken the game away from them but the nets have tied themselves in straitjackets many times this season after a 2 15 start they surprised everyone except themselves by remaining together and improbably began to work their way back up the standing since that start the nets are 27 24 the losses in their last two games are just the sort of thing that they can not afford having given away their cushion long ago and that was just what they did on friday night finding themselves in a bind that took all their effort to escape and then coming up just short perhaps they will be energized by their disdain for the officiating crew of don vaden bill spooner and derek richardson and their belief that they have been wronged who is to say that a team that recovered from a miserable start to the season and on friday nearly made their most heroic comeback does not have one more unlikely run in them after playing host to struggling denver on sunday the nets must somehow beat indiana and toronto in the last two games of the four game homestand and then go to orlando on friday and hope if we win tomorrow we 're right in the same spot we were four or five days ago kendall gill said so we have to win tomorrow and then we play orlando twice orlando 's got a tough schedule coming up we 've just got to win
