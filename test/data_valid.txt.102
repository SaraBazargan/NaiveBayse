with a blender and half an hour or so the possibilities for soups are infinite this time of year the first local asparagus is starting to turn up in farmers markets and fresh peas and spinach are everywhere any one of them or a combination can be the foundation for an easy first course that looks and tastes like the essence of spring pureed vegetable soups can be lean and spare or rich and creamy spicy or subtle hot or cold they can be vegetarian or quite meaty and much of the cooking time is just for simmering aside from their color each of these soups is completely different even though all go through the blender the asparagus soup gets almost all its flavor from the vegetable itself a flavor that is intensified by a brief period of pan roasting the spinach soup with a touch of nutmeg and some cream falls somewhere in between it 's really a classic combination and its flavor justifies that distinction pea soup with ginger inspired by a creation of the late chef felipe rojas lombardi pairs two quite powerful flavors i use basic techniques that will work for any vegetable soup you just need to cook the asparagus or whatever you choose until it is completely soft and then transfer it to the blender to make a smooth puree the seasonings in these soups can be adjusted to your taste think of examples as diverse as curry powder bacon or a dash of vinegar you can also start with a different stock like one made from vegetables the flavors in the pea soup are so assertive that you can use plain water i withhold some of the pan roasted asparagus to use as a garnish and you can do the same with other cooked vegetables before pureeing them if you like a soup with more chew just about any vegetable will substitute admirably for peas spinach or asparagus just remember that vegetables like turnips carrots and potatoes should be cut into smaller pieces so they cook quickly most important be extremely careful when pureeing hot soup if time allows it is safest to cool the soup before pureeing it if you 're in a hurry at least cool it to not much more than body temperature resting the cooking pan in a larger one filled with ice water is the most efficient way to reduce the chance of spattering pulse the blender on and off a couple of times before leaving it on and hold the top down until you 're sure it 's not going anywhere although it was the arrival of spring and fresh local vegetables that made me consider soup i do have a confession two of the recipes here are just as good with frozen vegetables i would happily use frozen peas given the labor saved frozen spinach tastes nearly as good as fresh although it does n't save much time or effort but frozen asparagus is simply not as flavorful cream of spinach soup time 30 minutes 1 pound spinach
