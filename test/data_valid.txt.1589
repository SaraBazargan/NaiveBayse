to the editor re as a business sets up a group takes steps to preserve a landmark jan 26 this article on the development of the pirelli building site for an ikea store failed to acknowledge the efforts of new haven 's alliance for architecture the alliance for architecture is a 12 year old organization that promotes interest in architecture in the new haven area through lectures tours and related events the alliance was also responsible in having marcel breuer 's armstrong rubber company aka the pirelli building placed on the state register of historic places in 1997 thereby having it recognized as a landmark our pursuit of this status grew out of our concerns when a regional mall was proposed for the site and we were alarmed that the building would be sacrificed it was our only way to garner its survival mall plans came and went and the pirelli building remained intact when ikea approached the city it is my understanding that mayor john destefano jr now having realized the building 's status and importance made preservation of the building part of the citys requirements in the development of the site when ikea first presented their development plans to the architectural community they proposed demolishing all of the two lower stories the tower remained precariously supported by the stair wells and support posts i and others voiced our concerns at that time and i followed up with other conversations with pat smith of ikea through these efforts and those of the long wharf advocacy group and others ikea later presented plans to preserve the tower and the two stories just below it though demolishing the remainder of the base plinth hopefully the dedicated efforts of all concerned will convince ikea to preserve more of the building thus bringing their interest in providing good modern design accessible to all full circle daniel j pardy hamden the writer is the chairman of the alliance for architecture
