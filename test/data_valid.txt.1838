it was not roy hobbs throwing off his hospital gown bleeding through his flannel jersey and blasting the game winning homer but if the yankees go on to win the world series it might become the stuff of legend after beating the baltimore orioles 6 3 at camden yards tonight the yankees are 10 1 since derek jeter insisted he could play with a strained rib cage muscle against the boston red sox on sept 7 it was the kind of gesture the principal owner george steinbrenner must have envisioned when he named jeter as captain in june and the yankees can trace their turnaround to that day we 're playing well jeter said today we 're pitching well and people are starting to come around offensively this is the time you want to do it you want to be hot at the end of the year heading into the postseason it 's all about who 's playing the best at that time you want it to carry over jeter had two hits tonight as the yankees stifled the orioles another also ran they are handling easily this month the yankees lead the red sox by five and a half games with 11 to play and roger clemens did his part tonight working seven innings for his 308th career victory it was another stellar start for the yankees who have received superior starting pitching to go with jeter 's return in the past 11 games yankee starters are 8 0 with a 254 earned run average david wells and mike mussina will each go for victory no 200 over the next two games we 're quality starters clemens said i think over time it should show we 're going to have our tests and our setbacks but our goals are so lofty and so high it 's pretty easy to stay focused clemens never trailed tonight a homer by alfonso soriano gave the yankees a 1 0 lead in the fifth and after orioles starter jason johnson threw behind the next hitter nick johnson umpire dan iassogna warned the benches there were no further incidents but the orioles seemed out of it errors in the sixth and seventh led to an unearned run in each inning and a september call up left fielder pedro swann forgot the number of outs and was late throwing home on a sacrifice fly johnson threw two wild pitches in the seventh when baltimore manager mike hargrove was ejected for arguing a call at first clemens 15 9 allowed two earned runs and seven hits and the victory tied him with old hoss radbourn for 17th place on the career list radbourn died in 1897 six years before the yankees franchise started and he once pitched 1311 innings over a two year span it 's fun for me to pass those guys clemens said they have great nicknames in their own right jeter is 14 for 41 341 since rejoining the lineup after missing a week his comeback may have been inspirational but that was not the point more than that is we got a great player back on the field third baseman aaron boone said he 's the heartbeat of the team from a defensive standpoint and an offensive catalyst standpoint in the night game of last saturday 's doubleheader jeter showed how far he has come since he dislocated his left shoulder on opening night with the devil rays in a shift overloading the right side of the infield on jason giambi in the fifth inning jeter tried to dash from first to third on a walk he beat third baseman jared sandberg to the bag but overslid on the wet dirt and was out jeter shifted his shoulder to avoid a collision but the play was strikingly similar to the one that caused the injury he admitted it was too risky i probably should n't have tried that jeter said but when i 'm playing situations come up jeter credited his winter conditioning with helping him feel strong again soon after the injury the results have shown he hit 297 last season and earned the ire of steinbrenner but with a 324 average now he has a chance to win his first batting title jeter is not very interested in that race you notice it but it 's not something you think about jeter said maybe you think about it after you clinch the division that time is coming soon for the yankees who may be peaking at the right time inside pitch the orioles have decided not to make an early postponement of thursday night 's game or to schedule it for earlier that day despite the approach of hurricane isabel the orioles spokesman bill stetka said the chief operating officer joe foss had conferred with the commissioner 's office and received clearance to wait we still hope that the storm will pass us and move east and that we will be able to get the game in stetka said the yankees are concerned about their flight that night to tampa fla told that the storm had slowed manager joe torre said just because it does n't knock down buildings does n't mean you can play baseball in it if the game is postponed it would be made up next weekend at yankee stadium
