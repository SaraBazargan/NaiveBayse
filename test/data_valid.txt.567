in the effort to assemble a professional tennis player parents with pockets as deep as wishing wells still leave their children at the doorsteps of academies these days they can remember when the george hamilton of tennis the tanned nick bollettieri could be spotted drinking in the sunshine as he eyed academy stars like andre agassi and jim courier during a golden era of paint by number instruction there are still bollettieri academy success stories like tommy haas and xavier malisse but there is also a trend toward a boutique styling over the factory production top players are being developed from a variety of cribs historically tennis is viewed as a genteel country club sport but lleyton hewitt 's connors esque edge was borne out of middle class adelaide australia venus and serena williams first smacked a ball on an inner city court croatia 's ivan ljubicic was plucked out of a refugee camp as a teen russia 's marat safin can remember the food shortages during perestroika and justine henin had to help raise her siblings in belgium after her mother 's death if rich kids are shown that they have to fight for everything in their life that nothing is going to come easy they can succeed ljubicic said it 's just that the thing with poor kids is it 's natural that you have to fight for everything you want badly to win because you know what life can be like if you do n't some parents pass a survivalist gene on to their children often tennis parents are classified as eccentric control freaks living vicariously through their offspring but they are also people from diverse backgrounds who want nothing more than a better life for their children sometimes they are hands on in guiding their kids toward opportunity right now parent coaches are everywhere particularly in the women 's game if richard and oracene williams can build the top two players in the world from scratch why not try it of the top 10 players on the tour venus and serena williams jennifer capriati martina hingis and jelena dokic have had the blueprints for their games laid out by their parents there is a bond between parent and player even if it seems the relationship is strained at times when the united states open unfolds this week it will mark the two year anniversary of the salmon incident involving damir dokic the father of jelena upset with the price of fish at the tennis center cafeteria he went on a rampage that left his daughter in tears and led to his brief ban from tour events it was not his first outburst and not the first time a tennis parent has made a scene as volatile and unpredictable as they can be parents can also provide instruction a player can believe in a parent is a lot better than having a coach because you can trust them said dokic ranked no 4 it 's more comfortable with me that 's the case a lot more players are doing it in the top 10 there 's close to 70 percent doing it i think it feels a lot better to have it that way damir has been conspicuously absent on the tour this year coaching his daughter over the phone i ask him a lot more about tennis than he wants to tell me jelena said i always have problems with tennis and i always go to him he gives me things to think about richard williams has been less visible this year too leaving most of the coaching up to his estranged wife oracene other parents have taken a more high profile role with their children after other coaches failed to work out stefano capriati has taken over his daughter jennifer 's career as has samantha stevenson the mother of alexandra it 's cheaper you share the same hotel room joked alexandra whose ranking has jumped 30 spots up from no 60 this year i just think i went through a lot of coaches and they did n't know what i needed for my game my mom has seen it all in our relationship it 's always been my mom and me we 'll argue and then it 's fine it 's great she does my laundry too some parent coached players do glean tips from other instructors at times and many have dabbled in academy life during their careers venus and serena williams were developed by their parents but also spent 18 months at rick macci 's academy as preteens although monica seles is listed as a former bollettieri student she mainly followed the lead of her father karolj who coached her to no 1 before he died four years ago karolj introduced monica to tennis by hitting balls to her in a parking lot over the years seles born in yugoslavia grew into a dominant player fulfilling her father 's dream of finding a better life through tennis she became a united states citizen in 1994 at the heart of the current eastern european rush of players there is the hope for opportunity that was missed by their elders the first coach for slovakia 's daniela hantuchova who is ranked no 11 was her grandmother a great player in her day who was not allowed to travel outside the country a hunger to succeed can be passed down from generation to generation or it can grow on its own ljubicic was 13 in 1992 when families surrounding his town began being killed in bosnia they were killing croatians silently like in the middle of the night ljubicic said they would just come in your house they knew exactly which houses were croatian or not croatian there were no sides because it was a serbian town with his mother and brother ljubicic said he escaped the war by jumping aboard one of the last planes out of the country before the airports were shut down when the flight landed in belgrade they traveled on a 48 hour bus ride and then crawled under barbed wire to find safety at a refugee camp in croatia months later ljubicic a junior tennis star was one of several players taken to italy by a club that was reaching out to help the children in the middle of italy we were these poor kids ljubicic said we looked poor because we were poor but we had a chance to play tennis it 's not the way all good players begin every story is different there has always been some aberrations in tennis martina navratilova was n't a conventional star but now different is as much the norm as ever before
