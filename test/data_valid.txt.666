the past few years have been discouraging ones for efforts to check the spread of nuclear weapons india and pakistan have abruptly pushed their way into the club of states possessing such arms north korea iraq and iran are pressing against the door although 187 countries have signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty four including india and pakistan have not and tougher inspection procedures are needed to make sure that all that have signed fully honor their obligations the clinton administration has rightly made discouraging nuclear proliferation one of its top priorities but flexing american power whether through bombing iraqi weapons labs or testing missile defenses will not suffice also needed is a stronger international consensus to discourage any new development of nuclear weapons and to dismantle more of those that now exist a conference that opens at the united nations today offers an opportunity the recent flurry of nuclear treaty ratifications by russia 's parliament including the approval of the nuclear test ban treaty sets a positive tone for the conference a coalition of non nuclear nations including mexico south africa and ireland is calling for american ratification of the test ban treaty unwisely rejected by the senate last year the coalition also seeks further weapons cuts by washington and moscow and adding britain france and china to future talks a constructive outcome would commit the nuclear weapons states to negotiate further reductions and would work out arrangements for tougher more intrusive inspections by the international atomic energy agency it would also renew efforts to bring the four remaining holdout nations into the nonproliferation treaty three of these india pakistan and israel are capable of producing nuclear weapons the other is cuba after this week 's opening speeches including one by secretary of state madeleine albright the conference will settle down to four weeks of hard diplomatic work an effective international consensus on proliferation issues will not come easily but establishing one would impart a new and necessary urgency to the challenge of curbing nuclear weapons thereby reducing the risks of nuclear war
