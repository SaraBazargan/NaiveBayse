to the editor re digital defense column july 27 thomas l friedman is narrowly correct to see cyberterrorism as more widely disruptive than a missile launched by a rogue but that does not eliminate the need for a missile defense system even one nuclear weapon launched against some hapless city would be a great humanitarian disaster such a nightmare scenario is becoming more probable with the rise of state sponsored suicide bombing where mutually assured destruction is synonymous with martyrdom rather than deterrence certainly one nuclear blast however small is much worse than any global network glitch david katcoff jericho vt july 29 2001
