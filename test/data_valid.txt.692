as a public servant william h webster has an impeccable resume mr webster who last week became the head of a new government board that will oversee the accounting industry is the only person to have served as the director of both the federal bureau of investigation and the central intelligence agency he has received the presidential medal of freedom and a special medal from the american bar association for outstanding leadership but outside washington mr webster 's record is less than perfect since he retired from the cia 11 years ago to build a lucrative second career as a corporate lawyer mr webster has repeatedly taken positions that critics say have been at odds with his reputation a lawyer who sued general motors for making unsafe pickup trucks says that after the automaker hired mr webster with great fanfare he permitted gm to shelve his report into whether the company had improperly destroyed documents relating to the case some labor leaders say that mr webster has not devoted enough time to his 100000 a year position on a government created board that monitors the teamsters union and a former chief economist with the federal communications commission says that mr webster 's involvement with nextwave a telecommunications company that defaulted on billions of dollars of payments to the fcc should disqualify him from being the accounting board 's chairman nextwave was a bottom feeder said gerald faulhaber a wharton school professor who served as the fcc 's top economist in 2000 and 2001 do i feel comfortable with my watchdog being involved with these guys no mr webster who did not return repeated calls or e mail messages for comment on his corporate life now faces criticism for his short stint as the head of the audit committee at us technologies a nearly bankrupt internet company that is under criminal investigation for possible fraud in august 2001 us technologies fired bdo seidman as its auditor after the firm said that the company 's financial records were disorganized and that some transactions had not been recorded mr webster and gregory earls the chief executive of us technologies said last week that us technologies did nothing wrong and that the company fired bdo seidman because its audit was expensive and slow but the accounting firm has now asked a federal judge to release it from its client confidentiality agreement with us technologies so that it can respond to what it says are false and misleading statements from mr webster even before these problems came to light mr webster 's appointment as head of the board sparked sharp criticism from democrats and some big investors they said he was not knowledgeable about accounting and at 78 too old to take on a tough and time consuming new post still many in washington say that they respect mr webster even the democrats who criticized his appointment to the accounting board were careful to say that they were not attacking him personally he is a top notch civil servant said griffin bell the former attorney general who asked mr webster in 1978 to head the fbi before mr webster took that job the agency conducted a background check with interviews of 500 people who knew him mr bell said and not one thing turned up against him soon after mr webster left the government and became a partner in the washington office of milbank tweed hadley mccloy in 1991 he took a surprising position in 1992 the air transport association an airline trade group hired him to lobby against fingerprinting and background checks for security screeners and airline employees who worked in secure areas facing opposition from the airlines the federal aviation administration delayed for four years before adopting a weakened requirement for background checks representative james oberstar a minnesota democrat told the los angeles times last year that he was flabbergasted that mr webster had once lobbied against the proposal i looked him square in the eye and asked 'would you be taking this position if you were still director of the fbi mr oberstar said in 1993 general motors hired mr webster to conduct an internal inquiry into whether it had destroyed documents relating to the safety of pickup trucks that had been made from 1973 to 1987 and that had fuel tanks mounted outside the vehicles frames mr webster was hired one month after a georgia jury returned a 105 million verdict against the company the verdict was later overturned on appeal and gm settled the case and three others mr webster never released his report said james butler the plaintiff 's lawyer who won and later settled why announce in a public press release if you 're going to have the former fbi director do an investigation if you 're not going to report the results mr butler asked suggesting that the findings may have been unfavorable mr webster should not have permitted the findings to be silenced mr butler said mr webster 's performance on a government created board that monitors the teamsters union for corruption has generated criticism and praise in the late 1990 's some teamsters complained that the union 's pension funds had been depleted under the board 's watch a labor leader who is not a teamster and has observed mr webster serve for the last decade on the board said he thought mr webster did not take the responsibilities very seriously and worked only a few hours a month on the board but marick masters a business professor at the university of pittsburgh said he thought mr webster had done a good job on the board considering its limited resources these are n't full time appointments they do n't have large staffs you have to be somewhat limited in what your expectations are about what these boards can do mr masters said it 's very difficult for one board to get in there and really investigate everything he said he thought mr webster would do a good job as head of the oversight board mr webster 's position on the board of nextwave telecom has also raised concern congressional investigators have said they will examine mr webster 's role at nextwave in addition to his work at us technologies nextwave is a bankrupt wireless company whose main asset is a set of airwave licenses that the company won in an auction from the government in 1996 but never paid for since 2000 the federal communications commission has been trying to recover the licenses from nextwave and sell them to other companies nextwave has sued the government to keep the licenses nextwave came in and they got more licenses than anyone else said mr faulhaber the wharton professor and then at their earliest opportunity they defaulted mr webster knew or should have known that nextwave 's actions were not in the consumers or the government 's best interest mr faulhaber said he said mr webster should not serve on the accounting board which demands someone whose reputation is above reproach he may be a perfectly fine fellow mr faulhaber said but this is a caesar 's wife situation
