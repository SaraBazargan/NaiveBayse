in 2003 as many as 98000 people in the united states will die as a result of medical errors of the estimated 1500 surgical patients each year who have had foreign objects sponges retractors gauze pads left in them during an operation many of those who survive face debilitating health problems because medicine lacks a mandatory national system for reporting errors and near misses unlike say aviation there is valid dispute about the actual number of medical mistakes but doctors and victims agree that the lack of oversight means that mistakes often come to light only when they reach the courtroom five percent of doctors are said to be responsible for more than half of malpractice post trial payouts but most cases of medical misadventures as the cdc calls them do n't make it that far only one in six victims files a malpractice suit and approximately half of those give up before getting to trial many patients face state mandated caps on their awards for pain and suffering like the 250000 limit president bush would like to introduce nationwide confidential settlements prevent many from telling their stories but those who do speak out will tell you for patients who have experienced medical errors the end of the trial is n't the end of the story here four people recount their versions surgical sponge and gauze left in a breast candy negrete when i went home my right breast started to increase in size it looked like a big plum in the emergency room they attached pumps to my chest for drainage but after 10 weeks they still could n't figure out what was wrong i was working for ibm i 'd be sent home because my clothes were soaking i could hear people whispering behind me you know 'she 's dying she 's got cancer i used to wake up during the night covered in gummy stuff like in alien then i started growing another breast underneath my armpit i went to a doctor he said 'candy there 's something in there i went into surgery they dug out this huge ball that my body formed around the gauze and sponge the trial was the summer of 2001 the hardest part is when they accuse you of money grubbing i got 250000 plus 16000 for medical expenses but now i have this deformed breast for a simple biopsy doctors right now i have this phobia of them with my luck any simple procedure and they 're going to kill me kidney transplant on the wrong side dan wingerd the entry was on my chart in three different places do n't put the kidney on the right put it on the left the surgeon attempted to attach my sister 's kidney to my right side prior to surgery we had diagnostic tests i had significant atherosclerotic plaque on the right side so plaque broke loose blocked the artery killed the kidney no one expected me to come off that table without a functioning kidney one would expect going to ucla the very best in transplant technology and service certainly not the shoddy lackadaisical care i received i did n't even get the pleasure of a single urination when i was well enough to think i called the surgeon i said 'what the hell were you thinking he said 'i just forgot i forgot that there was trouble on the right side and i did n't look at the chart before the surgery he admitted this to me i have to start over again on the transplant list because now i 'm not dealing with a family member 's donated kidney had this surgery been successful i would have resumed my career as an investment adviser i was traveling which i ca n't do now three days a week i 'm in dialysis for five hours i 'm getting ready to volunteer at the local district attorney 's office to help clear cold cases it 's just to make do to keep from going nuts unnecessary radical jaw surgery kim tutt i was told i had cancer in my jaw i was a 34 year old healthy person so everybody was shocked i was given three to six months to live the doctors thought they might be able to give me three more months if they removed the left side of my chin all the way to behind my right ear and replaced it with the fibula from my leg it was a huge enormously radical surgery whatever they would have suggested i would have done it i had a 10 year old and a 12 year old whatever time i could get was worth it i went through the surgery in july 2000 my surgeon called me in october and said 'we need to see you we went back 'it 's a good news bad news situation he said 'we think your original biopsy was cross contaminated at the lab you probably never had cancer it was one of those things where i should have been the happiest person in the world but it was overwhelming it was hard telling the boys i had cancer it sounds crazy but it was even harder telling them that i did n't i am permanently disfigured i 've undergone five surgeries i 'm still missing nine teeth chewing is not easy people notice that i 'm not normal that really really bothers the boys my trial starts the week of april 21 money will not change what my family has been through people who have cancer are cured but i 'm not a walking miracle i 'm a survivor of medical malpractice surgical tool left in stomach dan jennings after the surgery i did n't really seem to progress like i thought i should i went back to the doctor to do an x ray the technician shot a picture and said 'we need to have you change into another gown because the one you 're wearing is causing an artifact on the table so new gown new table same problem 'we 're going to put you in a different room third shot this time the radiologist comes out and says 'we need to call your doctor on the x rays i could see the silhouette of this big silver thing in my abdominal cavity he said 'that looks like it 's a retractor so i walked into my surgeon 's office everybody 's kind of mobilized and ready to see the pictures we put them up on the view box and he just starts shaking his head looking down at the floor he said 'i swear to god i do n't know how it got there do n't know how we could have left it i said 'what do we do he said 'it 'll probably take 20 to 30 minutes to open you up get it out and that 'll be it when they finished this doctor came over and he said 'we ran into a complication i said 'what 's that and he said 'you had necrotizing faciitis i knew what that was the flesh eating bacteria the damage was immense i am considered permanently disabled at this point my job used to consist of teaching physicians how to diagnose and treat sleep apnea it 's ironic that i was teaching and working with doctors now i 've filed suit against them last may the jury gave an award of 250000 for pain and suffering at this point we have both filed appeals they said in a deposition 'we do n't know where it came from we said 'so this is the story of the immaculate retractor
