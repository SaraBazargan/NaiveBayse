the girls in the van covering hillary by beth j harpaz illustrated 294 pp new york thomas dunne books st martin 's press 2495 almost any female reporter covering politics has at one time or another worried that the best story of the day the one she is missing is coming from a casual exchange in the men 's room so when the women covering hillary rodham clinton 's campaign for the senate were finally free to follow a candidate into the ladies room what happened the associated press reporter beth j harpaz who covered that race reports in the girls in the van that they were too intimidated to ask her anything i could n't deal with it i turned around and walked out one reporter confessed when she rejoined her colleagues harpaz was quick to console you did the nice thing you were just being human you 'd never hear that exchange between male reporters and that is one of the charms of this memoir the girls in the van the title echoes the boys on the bus timothy crouse 's classic macho chronicle of reporting the 1972 nixon mcgovern presidential race is an entertaining bouncy romp through the usual fun and games of covering a campaign but it offers more than a story of reporters sharing the perils and tedium of the road it gives an illuminating glimpse at how the celebrity of hillary clinton kept the news media off base this campaign was remarkable neither because a woman was running nor because women were covering her but because of clinton 's dual identity what 's wrong with us a colleague of harpaz 's lamented as they waited outside a school for the candidate to talk to them we 're still treating her like a first lady harpaz also gives a frank account of what it was like to be the mother of two children while following an energy devouring campaign like this one in 1972 no male reporter was shopping for diapers on the way home now women reporters do just about anything they have to do to cover both the campaign and their own home front and they see the women on the other side of the divide the candidate 's staff doing the same thing harpaz describes how this makes for a certain uneasiness in the classic push pull struggle between press corps and staff what do you say when a press secretary delays the release of a new advertisement so you can get home in time to see your kids before they go to bed thank you sort of but harpaz still worried about compromising herself these worries infiltrate her book in ways that may seem like ethical hairsplitting to non journalists should harpaz accept a signed copy of clinton 's book for her child who she knows wants it should she and her fellow reporters have sung happy birthday to hillary was it over the line to give her a cupcake with a candle on it on the other hand is it really fair to deny your sons a chance to tag along and meet the awesome senatorial candidate whose campaign is sucking up so much of their mother 's time harpaz freely admits to failings she chafes over the fact that neither she nor her colleagues could ever puncture clinton 's protective bubble she acknowledges how this frustration intensified the effort to snatch and run with the unguarded comment from clinton 's lips just how fair she asks herself is it to pounce on a blunder on gun control and turn it into the lead of a story i was torn on the one hand it seemed a little unfair to make such a big deal out of the type of mistake that anybody could have made on the other hand it was just about the only unscripted moment in an otherwise canned event if that was n't the lead what was the first lady supports gun control in the face of intense and constant criticism clinton somehow managed to work her way diligently to victory and it says quite a lot for harpaz 's memoir that she spends the latter part of her book mulling this over even coming to a grudging respect for a woman who could n't seem to please anybody for quite a long time the clinton campaign staff felt from the beginning that the press corps was underreporting their candidate 's base of support and harpaz concedes that she and her colleagues resisted the positive reactions of people who came to hear clinton speak but when you 've heard a hundred gushy tributes to a woman who 's been handed 'thousands of plaques you do n't really feel that it 's news in the strictest sense and when someone who strives to be as perfect and scripted as hillary does makes a mistake or gets heckled that 's the definition of news and therefore worthy of a story besides the people who hate her are always more dramatic than the people who love her as the campaign wore on clinton began holding meetings with women who did n't love her and harpaz marvels at how this changed the minds of many of them she asks herself did i pay too much attention to the hillary hater who ran down the street screaming 'you 're an enabler and not enough to the ladies who told me how brilliant she was would the coverage have had a different tone had the pre election polls indicated more strongly how decisive her victory would be it 's true that clinton went into her campaign carrying an unbelievable amount of scandal baggage everything from cattle futures to whitewater to monica and it dogged her tracks every step of the way she won anyway how harpaz buttonholed voters with that question after the election over and over people told her it 's her understanding of the issues her passion for the issues her ability to listen there 's just enough boilerplate campaign hype in those responses to make a reporter 's eyes glaze over yet harpaz all but admits that the journalistic hunger for slip ups left the news media blind to the possibility that such comments might be precisely why clinton never lost her bedrock support for all of her conflicts harpaz comes across as a hard working reporter in the classic style trying to do her best and then to think about what it all means when it 's over she remains dissatisfied with the rigidly controlled woman she covered and never understood but she also retains a healthy frustration with herself and her craft examining with a skeptical eye her own cynicism what she calls the occupational disease of reporters harpaz has written an honest book the result is an insider 's view of a female reporter grappling with a groundbreaking campaign one that could never have surfaced back in the days of timothy crouse patricia o'brien press secretary to michael dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign is the author with ellen goodman of i know just what you mean the power of friendship in women 's lives
