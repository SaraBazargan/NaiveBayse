first it was georgia 's fans moaning over narrow seemingly unimpressive victories over clemson and south carolina then it was tennessee quarterback casey clausen claiming that if he had played the vols would have whipped georgia on oct 12 this week kentucky quarterback jared lorenzen had imagined the thrill of sitting on the goal posts as they came down today after an upset of unbeaten georgia they say the cream rises to the top georgia defensive end david pollack said i guess we 've been overrated for so long people stopped looking at us well look again the spotlight is turning toward the bulldogs after their 52 24 victory over a solid kentucky team today before a sellout crowd of 71017 in commonwealth stadium georgia ranked no 3 by the new york times computer and no 5 in the associated press poll rolled up 529 yards and amassed 6 touchdown passes despite playing without three starters tackle jon stinchcomb the team 's best blocker musa smith the team 's leading rusher and wide receiver fred gibson the team 's best deep threat it was supposed to be a showcase game on national television for lorenzen who is nicknamed the pillsbury throwboy for his size 275 pounds and his passing success but it was georgia 's left handed quarterback the sophomore david greene who had a better day completing 16 of 32 passes for 251 yards and 4 touchdowns in fact lorenzen was not even the second best quarterback on the field the georgia freshman d j shockley completed 10 of 14 passes for 102 yards and 2 touchdowns bulldogs wide receiver terrence edwards demoted to the second team last year for dropping passes became the university 's career leader in receptions 184 with 5 catches for 127 yards he caught three touchdown passes today as georgia which is chasing its first southeastern conference championship in 20 years improved to 8 0 over all and 5 0 in the conference kentucky fell to 5 3 and 1 3 we 've stepped it up greene said of the georgia offense we 're starting to play to our potential we 're making big plays and that 's a big difference from earlier in the season georgia trailed by 24 21 at halftime but took over in the third quarter not only with offense but also with much better defense the bulldogs stormed through the line to harass lorenzen with pressure from defensive tackle johnathan sullivan and defensive end david pollack and the occasional blitzes of linebacker boss bailey lorenzen threw for 174 yards in the first half but for only 34 yards in the second georgia coach mark richt said a change in schemes helped shut down the wildcats who scored four times three touchdowns one field goal with seven possessions in the first half richt went to a cover 2 defense which uses two deep safeties that 's what coverage sacks are all about said richt whose team primarily played man to man defense in the first half you do hope if you play cover 2 that you cover long enough that you make the quarterback go from his first to his second to his third progression while he 's looking that gives the front four a little more time to put pressure on him lorenzen had the crowd on its feet for most of the first half it is not often a football player in the basketball mad bluegrass achieves the type of bumper sticker status lorenzen has this season in the first half he threw marvelous scoring passes of 24 yards to aaron boone and 60 yards to derek abney but in the second half under fierce pressure he struggled the bulldogs meanwhile displayed the depth of their offense after intermission first there was the deep pass greene to edwards down the left sideline on georgia 's first possession of the third quarter for a 41 yard scoring play georgia had the lead for good 28 24 on its next turn with the ball georgia carved up the wildcats defense with short throws on a 7 play 59 yard drive greene threw over the middle to edwards for a 12 yard touchdown pass with 10 minutes 25 seconds left in the third quarter the extra point made it 35 24 shockley came in on the next georgia possession and took the bulldogs 83 yards in 11 plays damien gary caught an 8 yard pass for the touchdown as the game turned into a rout with 2 25 left in the third quarter the defense has to guess because they do n't know what we 're going do shockley said it 's a big guessing game out there for defenses because we can do so much on offense
