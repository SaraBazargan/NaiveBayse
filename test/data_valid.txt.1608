children this time of year may dream of sugarplum fairies but auto executives must fantasize about going to sleep and waking up in thailand thailand has become a tropical retailer 's paradise where people seem to spend with abandon sales of beer soft drinks and motorcycles have all climbed to record levels this year car sales in october rose a dizzying 37 percent over the month a year ago cars are selling very well said john bonnell executive director of automotive resources asia a research firm in bangkok consumer confidence is way up thailand 's consumer spending boom is in its third year and shows little sign of slackening according to the central bank retail sales to thailand 's 612 million consumers rose in the second quarter to a record 304 billion baht 76 billion with consumer financing readily available and household debts still manageable consumers are gradually reducing thailand 's dependence on exports for growth even as demand for thai exports is recovering consumer spending is one of the major drivers of economic growth in thailand said daniel lian an economist at morgan stanley in singapore morgan stanley estimates that thailand 's economy will expand 63 percent this year driven by a 56 percent rise in consumption mr lian and other economists credit the trend in part to the fiscal policies of the government of prime minister thaksin shinawatra the consumer appetite already rekindled by thailand 's recovery from the financial crisis of 1997 and 1998 has been stoked to white hot intensity thailand is far from alone in wanting to overcome a dependence on exports overcoming export addiction has become a sort of mantra among asian policy makers especially those chafing at the political pressure from their biggest customer the united states while most recognize that the american trade deficit has left the dollar far overvalued they fear giving in to washington 's demands that they let their currencies appreciate for fear of losing their export competitiveness thailand and other asian exporters hope to replace demand from the united states with demand from home and neighbors the association of southeast asian nations recently agreed to form a european style economic community by 2020 creating a market of 530 million people with public savings rates high asian governments had typically recycled deposits into the economy through banks which tended to lend to corporations building export capacity the asian financial crisis crippled these banks leaving them unable or unwilling to lend to companies that in many cases are still deep in debt individuals were n't really touched by the bubble and the financial crisis said pedro rodriguez chief executive of cetelem thailand a consumer credit subsidiary of bnp paribas mr thaksin also recognized the potential of the thai depositor as an engine of growth when he came to power in early 2001 he adopted policies that encouraged consumer spending including urging government owned banks to begin lending to households he also instituted policies to help the less affluent utilize overlooked assets like rice paddies turning them into collateral other programs promote ownership of homes and computers these schemes are creating capital and assets for households mr lian said in turn they promote spending once you understand that you own more capital than you think you can decide to plan more durable consumption he said and so thais are doing just that led by a voracious appetite among 30 somethings mr rodriguez said the bank of thailand projects that property sales will rise 30 percent this year new housing was up 10 percent in the first eight months most of cetelem 's financing mr rodriguez said goes toward decorating those new homes or improving existing ones home electronics are hot items the market research firm idc says computer sales and cellphone subscriptions are growing at double digit rates vehicle sales are at their highest since early 1997 with pickup trucks especially popular because the thai government exempts pickups from excise taxes thailand is the world 's second largest market for them after the united states pickup sales rose 252 percent in october according to toyota motor thailand which has become the industry 's de facto scorekeeper toyota dominates the vehicle market with 473 percent of the passenger car segment despite the consumer spending boom in comparison with the average american the average thai is poor even in relatively affluent bangkok the average resident earns 12000 a year according to the ac nielsen corporation lending therefore has played a crucial role in thailand 's consumer spending boom consumer loans rose 235 percent in the first half of this year over the similar period of 2002 morgan stanley estimates with many loans resembling microfinance cetelem for example worked with kasikornbank of thailand to offer personal loans to thais earning as little as 1950 a year mr rodriguez estimates that half of the televisions personal computers and other white goods sold in thailand are sold on credit despite the surge in consumption economists say that thais are nowhere near being over their heads in debt personal indebtedness among thais is still far lower than in europe or the united states even with exports growing 9 percent in the third quarter consumer spending is increasingly contributing to thailand 's growth while consumption accounted for just under half of thailand 's economic expansion in 2002 morgan stanley estimates it will account for about 55 percent of the economy 's expansion this year indeed economists say that mr thaksin appears to have steered his country 's economy into a virtuous cycle with consumer spending lifting the economy and economic growth in turn buoying consumer confidence
