to the editor re loyal two legged lobbyists raise banner of dog rights front page march 25 when i was a commissioner of parks and recreation in san anselmo calif i witnessed firsthand the arrogance of dog owners and the depth of their denial regarding the impact dogs have on the rest of the population before acquiring a dog people must consider whether they have the means to support their pet 's physical needs without looking to public lands and agencies to solve their problems no one objects to the purchase construction and maintenance of private dog parks but i have never seen this option pursued it is inevitable that when off leash dogs are introduced to a public area use of the space by people diminishes many people with good reason are wary of dogs our local state and national parks were developed for use by people anything that precludes that use or enjoyment should be discouraged if not banned mark adamsbaum san anselmo calif march 25 2001
