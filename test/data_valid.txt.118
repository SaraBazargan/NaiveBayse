it 's early days yet for the german election but if the burghers of bremen are any guide the conservative challenger from the south edmund stoiber is going to find it hard to shake the impression that he is a little too rigid and bavarian for northern tastes yet in this ancient town of 550000 on the weser river there is also significant disappointment with the social democratic chancellor gerhard schroder underlining a mood of cynicism with national politics and national parties i think this is an important election for germany said marlena schulte 43 taking the children of a friend through the flower market in front of bremen 's superb 15th century city hall i do n't think things are going well especially in the economy germany has been cruising along without change for too long said ms schulte an independent ferry operator people with jobs have too much security and those without jobs do n't have a chance five months before the sept 22 national elections mr stoiber is still something of an unknown quantity to her despite his reputation for economic management and his nine years as the leader of bavaria one of germany 's most prosperous states i ca n't say a lot about him now ms schulte said but at least he 'd be something new she laughed then said of course schroder was something new too and it has n't gone so well ms schulte was standing near a brass statue of a donkey dog cat and rooster central to the fable of the bremen town musicians a quartet of animals who came here to find a fortune their music was so awful that a band of robbers fled in horror and the town was saved the fable is a decent analogy for politicians ms schulte thinks awful noises that can with luck do some good anyway mr schroder 's biggest problem is the economy with unemployment at over four million after he pulled off the considerable feat of defeating helmut kohl in 1998 mr schroder said rashly that unless he got the number of jobless below 35 million he should not be re elected he has since changed his mind of course citing the impact of sept 11 on the global economy mr schroder has been anything but an economic radical trying to balance calls to give business more ability to shed employees with preserving the cozy partnership between government business and labor that his union supporters demand the weak economy has left the chancellor a strong campaigner with a tough race against mr stoiber opinion polls continue to show the social democrats around 34 percent and the conservative parties represented by mr stoiber at 40 percent wolfgang hildebrand 44 a salesman for the wholesale trade has been unemployed for several years he has lost faith in political change i do n't think anything will be different after the election he said as shoppers brushed by i do n't know who will win but the losers will be us mr schroder and his social democratic party have disappointed mr hildebrand as have the greens now in the ruling coalition their pacifist and anti establishment principles hobbled by power mr hildebrand sees no easy answers for the german economy least of all from mr stoiber he 's made a very negative impression on me said mr hildebrand he 'll put pressure on the little people especially on the unemployed by cutting social benefits which is easy to do but schroder has no real ideas either mr schroder can take some comfort in polls that show that if there were a direct election for chancellor which there is not since germans vote for parties he leads mr stoiber 41 percent to 31 percent but the same forsa polls in stern magazine show that 52 percent of germans like mr hildebrand think that no party can best deal with germany 's problems the big german union ig metall has more than 33000 members in this proud hanseatic city whose 1200 year history is tied up in ships and shipbuilding but the last big shipyard once the city 's largest employer closed in 1996 still said dieter reinken head of ig metall here the local grand coalition of conservative christian democrats and social democrats has provided decent government since 1995 bringing new investment and industry to bremen in a partnership between universities and business rather like those mr stoiber has fostered in bavaria bremen has become a center for aerospace research the second stage of the european ariane rocket is built here and wings for airbus while daimlerchrysler makes mercedes benz roadsters and c class sedans and wagons close to the port where many are exported mr reinken 's union is pushing the government for higher pay with warning strikes stoppages that social democrats fear do nothing to further their case for election day mr reinken said that the vote would turn on the economy with the crime and anti immigration issues pushed by mr stoiber secondary his union members will vote mostly for mr schroder true to their anticonservative tradition he said but he is scarcely a schroder enthusiast illustrating how hard it may be for the chancellor a former governor of nearby lower saxony to secure even his core support in a tepid economy i do n't think all the credit schroder gets among the people is really deserved mr reinken said but people keep trusting him anyway immigration will remain a hot topic with mr stoiber trying to derail a modest new immigration law mr schroder proposed bremen 's population is 10 percent foreign but the climate is relatively peaceful i live in an area with a lot of foreigners and my daughter went to school with a lot of foreigners and we see it as normal said rudiger graf 60 what would we do without immigrants everything would stop even mr reinken thinks mr stoiber has erred here saying schroder wants to push stoiber into a right wing corner and he has to think carefully about this
