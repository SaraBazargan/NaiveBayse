two former kmart executives were indicted yesterday by a detroit grand jury on federal charges of fraud conspiracy and making false statements over their recording of a 42 million payment that resulted in an overstatement of kmart 's results the executives who ran kmart 's drugstore division until they were dismissed from the company nine months ago had been trying to spruce up their division 's performance in a particular quarter according to investigators the two men enio a montini jr and joseph a hofmeister were also charged with fraud by the securities and exchange commission in a related complaint they are the first people to be indicted as a result of investigations into kmart 's former management that began after an anonymous letter detailing internal problems was sent to the kmart board and government officials last january around the time kmart sought chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the investigations are continuing the complaints filed yesterday offer a glimpse into the byzantine world of retail accounting describing how one eight figure payment intended to cover a five year period was used to improve the quarterly results at kmart 's drugstore division the payment was made as a kind of advance by american greetings to kmart on the anticipated sale of greeting cards at american greetings the payment would be offset by actual sales of cards over the term of the contract a spokesman david poplar said it 's a classic case of matching expenses with revenue mr poplar said but at kmart the entire 42 million was recorded in a single quarter which improved the company 's results per share for that period by 6 cents under generally accepted accounting principles as well as sec rules the payment known as a vendor allowance should have been recorded over the entire term of the contract the sec complaint states the quarter ended in august 2001 five months before kmart filed for bankruptcy the pressure is always there to meet the needs of today and let tomorrow take care of itself said tom newkirk an associate director of enforcement for the sec that 's not the way the capital markets run investors need accurate information lori mctavish a spokeswoman for kmart said the company would not comment on the charges these two individuals are no longer employed by kmart and have not been for some time she said adding kmart has and will continue to cooperate fully with all government investigations the payment came about as a result of a decision by mr montini 51 and mr hofmeister 52 to turn over all of the discounter 's greeting card business to a single supplier the winning bidder american greetings agreed to pay kmart 50000 for each of the 827 stores where hallmark had been selling cards the total came to 42 million the five year deal was completed on jan 21 2002 one day before kmart filed for bankruptcy american greetings executives aware of the retailer 's shaky finances had insisted on a repayment provision in the agreement in case kmart canceled the contract without cause mr montini concealed that from his division 's accountant on three occasions according to the sec complaint characterizing the contract as no strings attached in the second quarter of 2001 which ended aug 1 the drugstore division was having trouble meeting its gross margin numbers so the 42 million was recorded as a 27 million offset to a payment of the same size that kmart had made to hallmark with the remaining 15 million booked as an incremental vendor allowance when the accountant after seeing a copy of the american greetings contract questioned mr montini about whether it included a repayment provision he and mr hofmeister engaged in a charade wherein montini called hofmeister into his office and chastised him for preparing the draft incorrectly according to the indictment he then told the accountant that he would have american greetings sign a new letter reflecting the correct understanding about the money and asked her to draft it later kmart 's internal auditors sought to have the language in the letter clarified and asked mr montini to send it to american greetings the grand jury does not believe that this letter was ever forwarded to american greetings the indictment states american greetings faxed a letter of its own specifying that kmart must pay liquidated damages if it ended the contract without cause before the term was up that letter was concealed from auditors and the division accountant according to the indictment at the end of 2001 mr montini received a 750000 forgivable retention loan from kmart the sec complaint states approved by kmart 's board had the board of directors known these facts it is highly unlikely that montini would have received the 750000 the complaint adds one retail expert said he expected the sec to call for an overhaul of retail accounting rules before long it 's the last of the wild wild west on wall street said the expert burt flickinger iii managing partner of the strategic resource group a consulting firm gary m giblen a retail analyst for c l king said accounting rules for vendor allowances were among the easiest to bend the temptation is too great to abuse the accounting so you can deliver what the street wants you to deliver he said mr hofmeister began working at kmart in 1972 and mr montini joined the company in 1982 a kmart spokeswoman said yesterday mr montini resigned from his current job as head of merchandising for the rite aid drugstore chain
