the central intelligence agency 's cold war entanglements in guatemala are like a malignant tumor that can not be eradicated in 1995 the agency seemed to deal belatedly but decisively with its misdeeds john deutch the cia director dismissed two senior officers and disciplined several others for mishandling relations with the guatemalan military and failing to keep congress adequately informed about operations in the central american nation but now all seems forgiven as the agency prepares to award a distinguished career medal to the highest ranking official who was fired the cia contends that the award to terry ward who was once chief of covert operations in latin america is intended to honor his achievements over a long career and should not be read as a nullification of mr deutch 's action agency officials note that even as he sacked mr ward mr deutch said his decision did not preclude recognition of mr ward 's previous service but the unmistakable message of the award is that george tenet mr deutch 's successor does not think mr ward 's behavior was all that reprehensible the guatemala matter was not a minor mistake it involved a breach of the most basic covenant that must govern the operations of an intelligence agency in a democracy mr ward failed to insure that congress as required by law was kept fully and currently informed about the abusive conduct of guatemalan officers who were on the agency payroll this included allegations that one of the men had condoned the murder of an american innkeeper in guatemala and the killing of a guatemalan guerrilla married to an american lawyer mr tenet who has worked for the white house and the senate and served as mr deutch 's deputy is wise in the ways of washington surely he knows that an award like this tells agency employees that the boss is repudiating the decision of mr deutch and is more interested in befriending the cia 's operations division than in insisting on the highest standards of conduct it is no secret that mr ward 's dismissal outraged many members of the espionage service perhaps it is just a coincidence but the rehabilitation of mr ward comes just as mr deutch 's stature has been diminished by new disclosures that he mishandled classified information when he ran the cia and that some of his top aides including mr tenet may have tried to shield him from investigation after he left the agency in the spy business accounts tend to get settled eventually though often in opaque ways if mr tenet did not want to create the impression that the agency was absolving mr ward he could have quietly overruled the decision of his operations chief james pavitt to grant the award at the least when the award is presented later this month mr tenet or mr pavitt should say that in honoring mr ward the cia is not excusing or belittling his transgressions
