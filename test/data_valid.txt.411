for having just beaten the defending super bowl champion today miami dolphins linebacker zach thomas felt strangely as if he almost had the day off that is because the dolphins now boast an offense to complement their heralded defense that offense controlled the ball for a striking 39 minutes 59 seconds in allowing the dolphins to seize sole possession of first place in the american football conference east with a 26 13 victory over the new england patriots before 73369 at pro player stadium we used to win games in the fourth quarter thomas said after most of his teammates had left the locker room now we can win 'em in the first and second that just shows how much our offense has improved dolphins coach dave wannstedt said his players arrived today with a sense of urgency after an embarrassing 49 30 loss to kansas city a week ago they came in determined to run on the patriots 29th rated run defense and new england countered by sometimes rushing eight players the result was that miami 's celebrated ricky williams rushed 36 times four short of his career high in new orleans for 105 yards williams 's 29 yard average showed that nothing came easy but he succeeded at one thing helping keep the patriots offense off the field in between quarterback jay fiedler pierced the patriots for 190 passing yards and 2 touchdowns as well as scoring the game 's first touchdown on an 8 yard scramble fiedler had no interceptions after a three interception nightmare at kansas city a couple of times early today jay threw incompletions out of the back of the end zone wannstedt said when you do that you have the mind set that you 're not going to give the football up and he made some big plays the weather was also a miami ally today thirteen times the teams have played in miami in september or october when the heat is still a factor and the patriots 3 2 are still looking for their first victory miami 4 1 ran the ball on 9 of 10 plays in an early fourth quarter drive and fiedler could tell the heat was having an effect you could see it in their faces and the way they were standing and kneeling he said they were a little bit worn out cornerback patrick surtain 's return from a knee injury also enlivened miami he had an interception and his coverage helped throw off the timing of patriots quarterback tom brady brady was 17 of 31 for 240 yards but most of his success came after the dolphins had forged a 17 point lead i think i bring a feeling of confidence to this team surtain said after last season 's super bowl most valuable player brady had been sacked three times and intercepted twice the defense can call certain plays and leave me out on an island as a sign of their dismal play the patriots at halftime had given away more yards in penalties 44 than their offense had gained 32 defensive end jason taylor exploited tackle matt light until the patriots opted to frequently use two blockers on him taylor sacked brady and forced a punt on new england 's first series and on the second series he forced brady to fumble nine plays later fiedler scored on the 8 yard run tebucky jones blocked olindo mare 's extra point try the first point after block by new england in nearly seven years surtain soon intercepted a brady pass which led to mare 's 36 yard field goal but new england linebacker tedy bruschi received an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for jumping on a teammate 's back to block the kick and miami elected to take the points off the scoreboard it became a trade of 3 points for 7 when chris chambers caught fiedler 's 7 yard pass and mare 's 40 yard field goal made it 16 0 at halftime the patriots cut their deficit to 10 points after david patten caught a 34 yard touchdown pass from brady 5 25 into the third quarter but a 10 play 74 yard drive late in the quarter with randy mcmichael scoring on a 1 yard pass from fiedler virtually sealed the victory for miami williams cast aside lofty playoff talk all i can say is he said we 're the type of team that we 're going to battle especially at home
