when moderates triumphed in parliamentary elections in iran last month they probably did not anticipate that their victories would resonate in the living rooms of wealthy americans but the clinton administration eager to encourage moderation in the land where the united states has been reviled as the great satan is about to ease some import bans on iranian consumer goods pistachios caviar and carpets this opens the door for trade in both directions and does it in a way that is purely commercial and on a purely civilian basis said robert pelletreau the chairman of the american iranian council an organization founded several years ago for discussion of issues involving the united states and iran and a former american envoy to egypt the value of the pistachios caviar and carpets may be relatively small in terms of iran 's overall trade but it is significant for the boost it can give to private iranian entrepreneurs by pumping much needed hard currency into their country administration officials said the move may also affect another kind of currency less definite but no less real in the united states the social cachet that comes from being able to buy things that have been largely forbidden since the shah of iran was driven from the peacock throne in 1979 whether persian rugs are better than those from say india or pakistan may be debatable just as it is debatable whether caviar from iranian sturgeons is better than that from russian sturgeons but some merchants who deal in rugs and caviar predicted tonight that imports from iran would become fashionable almost overnight iranian caviar is going to be very trendy predicted silverio benitez a sales associate at petrossian 's restaurant boutique on west 58th street in new york which sold more caviar last year than ever before partly because people wanted to put something special on their crackers to celebrate the arrival of 2000 mr benitez declined to say exactly how much caviar petrossian sells tiffany does n't boast of its sales in diamonds after all but he allowed that it sells about as much as any eatery on the planet and no wonder petrossian will fix up a nice caviar picnic basket for a mere 75 or so in general this is going to open up the caviar market mr benitez said but will prices go down and if so for how long will the iranian caviar be as good as the russian caviar that petrossian gets from the caspian sea by way of paris and will people who like caviar be able to tell the difference mr benitez withheld predictions on those weighty issues but he was sure that iranian caviar will become popular because it 's available like cuban cigars exactly well not exactly as for persian rugs so called because they have been around since long before persia became iran in 1935 two prominent washington area rug businessmen predicted that they will become the rage simply because they will become available james keshishian whose family business has been selling rugs in washington and its suburbs for 70 years said prices of persian rugs might go up at first then come down as the supply grows then go up again as iranian exporters get shrewder in the ways of the western marketplace they may sell very well mr keshishian said if they look right his voice softened as he explained how persian rug makers sometimes wash their creations gently in tea to soften the colors and texture mr keshishian who has taught college courses in rug appraisal recalled the days before the shah was toppled when 60 percent of the rugs his business sold were persian and 40 percent were everything else since then he said his business has sold 70 percent everything else and 30 percent persian with the bulk of the persian rugs two decades or more old another washington area rug seller who asked not to be identified by name for fear of offending anyone said he sells lots of indian and pakistani rugs but still welcomes the lifting of the import bans persians make better rugs he said they 've been at it a long time we 'll sell quite a few the lifting of the import ban is likely to be announced here on friday at a conference of the american iranian council administration officials said the white house spokesman joe lockhart said president clinton has been looking at a variety of ways to encourage a constructive dialogue with iran meanwhile the world bank said today that it is considering loans to iran totaling 231 million for the first time since 1994 so far the united states opposes the loans which would be used for sewerage and education when it comes to easing world tensions caviar and rugs go only so far
