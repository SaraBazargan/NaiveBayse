donna newman can talk to me but she ca n't talk to her client ms newman is an attorney who was assigned to represent jose padilla the former chicago gang member accused of participating in a qaeda plot to detonate a radioactive bomb in the united states i have no trouble believing that mr padilla who now calls himself abdullah al muhajir is a dangerous man he may well be but given the way his case has been handled by the bush administration we have no way of knowing how much of a terror threat he really was and no prospect of finding out anytime soon mr padilla an american citizen has been sucked into a procedural black hole in which he no longer has any legal rights this is a new and dangerous region that is outside the public 's view and for the time being at least beyond the reach of the constitution if left unchecked this contempt for the law and due process could pose more of a threat to our way of life than al qaeda mr padilla is locked in a navy brig in south carolina he has not been charged with any crime he is not allowed to speak with ms newman the government has no plans to present a case against him and no plans to let him go officials have said in essence we 've got him and you can forget about due process the kgb was very good at this sort of thing and it 's chillingly ironic that mr padilla 's arrest was announced from moscow by attorney general john ashcroft who happened to be in russia on an unrelated matter we have captured a known terrorist who was exploring a plan to build and explode a radiological dispersion device or 'dirty bomb in the united states said mr ashcroft it is now believed that mr ashcroft may have overstated the case somewhat but if as most people suspect mr padilla really was involved in some sort of terror conspiracy it is almost impossible to believe that the combined efforts of the cia and fbi have failed to come up with enough evidence to hold him legitimately on some charge but the government wo n't produce the evidence mr padilla has been slapped with the legally dubious designation of enemy combatant and in the administration 's view that is enough of a basis for holding him until the cessation of hostilities in the war against terror that is tantamount to a life sentence he 's been tried and convicted by the executive branch said ms newman her voice conveyed the frustration she feels at being assigned to represent mr padilla but not being permitted to do so in any way that might be effective in the united states as opposed to the many tyrannical societies we 've known and are coming to know the government is not permitted to hustle its citizens into prison without offering a legally sound reason for their incarceration and without giving the accused an opportunity to challenge their loss of liberty today it may be padilla tomorrow it might be you i believe the government has the goods on mr padilla but for whatever reasons finds the due process route to be inconvenient that kind of arrogance of power has no place in the us where the rule of law is supposed to be something very special freedom comes with a heavy price tag ben franklin said in 1755 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety you do n't abandon the rule of law and due process simply because the populace is angry and frightened the united states is strong enough to handle the likes of jose padilla within the precious boundaries of the law and the constitution if new rules are needed for the processing and detention of terror suspects then by all means establish new rules but you do n't abandon all rules while waiting for new ones to be promulgated the war against terror is not merely a fight for survival it 's a fight for the survival of a free and democratic way of life if that 's not the case then we 're just blowing stale smoke rings of hypocrisy when we place our hands over our hearts and recite pledges about liberty and justice or sing about the free and the brave
