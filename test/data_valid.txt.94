linked together by mysterious events in the south pacific this summer the former nba player bison dele and his brother miles dabord were linked together again today they were linked in memory a service was held for the brothers at the trinity baptist church there were soothing songs prayers dozens of photographs and perhaps most poignantly loving words from the friends and family members who cherished them these two men were as different as two sides of a coin lewis merrick a friend said yet we must always remember they are two sides of the same coin searching for that unknown edge in life they forgot to look home the greatest edge you can find in life is to stand in the protective shadow of those who love you the body of dele formerly known as brian williams has not been found though it is believed that he his girlfriend serena karlan and the french boat captain bertrand saldo were killed aboard dele 's 55 foot catamaran the hakuna matata at sea as they were bound from tahiti to hawaii in early july dele was 33 dabord the only suspect born as kevin williams fell into a coma in september after an apparent suicide attempt he died two weeks ago in chula vista calif he was 35 paul white praised dabord for his knowledge and sense of humor white told how after playing basketball in san francisco they used to talk about every subject miles was one of the most intelligent persons i have ever met said white who hugged the brothers mother patricia phillips after he finished he was interested in math history and he was an extremely funny man he had keen insight into the human condition miles was a gentle man sometimes too gentle miles and i shared freely there were no barriers leondre harris a cousin told about how he was with dele when he received his first kiss and the first time he was stood up dele was 15 harris 12 we were going to meet some girls said harris who along with dele rode the bus for much of the day for that special mission we did n't find girls brian said 'we 'll try another day he also spoke about his friend 's love for running which it seems was deeper than his love for his eventual profession dele who played for several teams in his eight year career was perhaps best known for his contribution to the 1996 97 chicago bulls who captured their second of three straight nba championships in 1998 brian williams said that he wanted to be known as bison dele in honor of his family 's slave heritage and american indian ancestry brian 's favorite sport was cross country harris said he could outrun every center in the nba easily the brothers harris added were guys of many talents who loved each other very dearly regardless of what anyone says the service featured several selections from the trinity baptist church choir and an especially moving rendition of do n't cry for me by jennifer morris a cousin another friend patti henleys sang amazing grace in the program there were two short obituaries which were later read by evelyn cain another family friend merrick 's words may have been the most moving i call out the names of brian carson williams and kevin eugene williams merrick said brothers in life and now yes brothers in death sons to us all a double sadness is born today because two children are dead
