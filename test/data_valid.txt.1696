to the editor re justice o'connor on executions editorial july 5 as a former lawyer for the american civil liberties union and a fervid opponent of the death penalty i am still deeply troubled by justice sandra day o'connor 's death penalty speech as you say an anti death penalty activist could not have put it more pointedly and justice o'connor 's speech will resonate in the political arena but the last thing we need is political speeches by supreme court justices federal judges should confine their views to legal opinions how comfortable will we be when supreme court justices and federal judges start campaigning for an expansion of the powers of the police or for less restrictive environmental laws or perhaps for preservation of the death penalty did n't the decision by the five conservative activists in bush v gore give us all we needed of a politicized supreme court ralph j temple ashland ore july 9 2001
