senate democrats took on the administration 's tax cut plan in earnest today with the release of a sharply different economic stimulus proposal calling for a 300 a person rebate check and 40 billion in aid to states and cities the one year plan announced in cleveland by senator tom daschle the minority leader would spend 141 billion to stimulate the economy in contrast to the 10 year 674 billion plan proposed by president bush it would drop the administration 's proposal to eliminate the dividend tax an idea with diminishing support on capitol hill and concentrate its tax relief at the lower to middle end of the economic spectrum with few benefits for the wealthy today 's plan is likely to become the democrats most reliable political tool once the jockeying over tax cuts begins on tuesday with mr bush 's state of the union address even though the party lacks the votes to pass it although some democrats have slightly different ideas on how to stimulate the economy the party appears to be more unified against mr bush 's economic ideas than it was in 2001 and its leadership has begun to take heart in the president 's slippage in opinion polls particularly on economic issues the democratic leadership in the house and senate is in agreement on the populist appeal of tax rebates and are intended to draw the sharpest possible contrast with the administration 's emphasis on cutting taxes on stock dividend economists tell us that the wealthy are far less likely to spend a tax cut than middle income families mr daschle a south dakota democrat said today in an address to the city club of cleveland in an atmosphere of economic weakness and tight budgets should we be giving scarce dollars to the people who can afford to put them under the mattress mr daschle said in an interview today that democrats believed that they had to join the tax cutting bandwagon to create jobs and energize a listless economy after an election last year in which the party 's ideas failed to draw widespread support resisting any further tax cuts could have become a serious political problem for the democrats but mr daschle said his proposed tax cuts would not increase the deficit nearly as much as would mr bush 's plan beyond its political usefulness democratic leaders say the plan includes several ideas that could form the basis of a compromise with republicans in the senate the chamber that will become the playing field in the tax cut competition at the moment mr bush lacks the votes to pass his plan in the senate now that several moderate republicans have sharply criticized the dividend tax cut and the resulting growth in the deficit to win back those moderates and a few centrist democrats republicans like senator charles e grassley of iowa chairman of the senate finance committee are already talking about cutting back on the bush plan and paring the dividend tax cut today senator max baucus of montana the ranking democrat on the finance panel said he would consider a compromise with the republicans if it contained several elements of the democratic plan in particular the aid to states many of which are facing huge budget gaps mr baucus said he was open to a compromise on cutting tax rates which the daschle plan avoids but not at the highest levels last month mr baucus proposed dropping the income tax on the first 3000 of taxable wage income which is similar in effect to the rebate idea but would take longer to stimulate the economy he also proposed 75 billion in aid to states it 's a very good start and i do n't disagree with anything in it mr baucus said of mr daschle 's proposals i think our goal here however is to get a broad based bill and try to avoid a 51 vote partisan bill so i want to work with senator grassley to come up with something that might get 60 votes or more and to that end i 'm open to talking about rate cuts as long as the size of the package comes down mr baucus 's comments illustrate the continuing difficulty mr daschle is likely to encounter in holding together his caucus democrats across capitol hill have spent the last month holding news conferences to announce various economic proposals only some of which are in the overall plan released today earlier this week senators jon corzine of new jersey and mary l landrieu of louisiana proposed a refund of social security and medicare payroll taxes and senator byron l dorgan of north dakota proposed a rebate plan slightly different from mr daschle 's senator john b breaux of louisiana a centrist who is likely to be an influential swing vote on any tax plan has not yet committed to any of the ideas but aides said he wants a plan much smaller than the president 's house democrats who will have less influence in the debate because of the more rigid republican control of that chamber issued a similar version of today 's plan earlier this month no democrats have expressed support for the dividend tax cut the largest component of the white house plan and several republicans have come out against it ari fleischer the president 's press secretary ridiculed the multiplicity of democratic voices today saying it was impossible to tell which alternative would emerge as the party 's plan he also said the president was not interested in the tax rebate idea mr grassley was only slightly less dismissive saying he would consider the plan among many other proposals senator daschle 's announced plan appears very light on job creation and very heavy on political theater mr grassley said today 's plan would extend unemployment insurance benefits to the one million workers whose benefits have run out but are still searching for a job to encourage business investment the plan would allow a 50 percent deduction for new equipment an increase from the current 30 percent and would permit small businesses to write off 75000 in investments up from 25000 small businesses would also get a 50 percent tax credit on the cost of employee health premiums of the 40 billion in aid to states 15 billion would be unrestricted and the rest would be earmarked for domestic security education medicaid and new public works mr daschle said the aid was intended to allay state tax increases that could undermine the effects of federal tax cuts mr daschle said democratic leaders chose the tax rebate method because of its immediate stimulus and because it was easier to understand and benefited far more people than the dividend tax cut he also said it was more responsible than the president 's reckless plan and he predicted it would garner some republican support
