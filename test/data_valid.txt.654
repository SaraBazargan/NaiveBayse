if i had a dollar for every time i heard someone in the last three months say that lebron james would be better off going to college for a year or two i 'd be rich enough to front him the money to become his agent as we sat in our throwback jerseys watching march madness unfold in all its network hyped splendor hearing dick vitale holler on espn this is what you 're missing lebron you still have time to reconsider baybeeee i would remind my young charge of some other novel aspects of college basketball he is apparently going to deprive himself of as a professional james is not likely to be put in the position of voting to forfeit his last two games the way the student athletes at st bonaventure did this week after the atlantic 10 conference gutted the team 's season for using an ineligible player he will not have his team barred from postseason play for academic fraud by its own administration this week 's big news at fresno state he will not be dragged into the sordid allegations enveloping the university of georgia and the spectacle of a head coach jim harrick sr letting his son jim harrick jr take the fall despite the career rap sheet harrick sr has compiled on his own quite the choice james has make a bundle in the national basketball association following the ascendant career path of kobe bryant kevin garnett and tracy mcgrady or take a dip in the cesspool of college basketball that leaves too many vulnerable young men tattooed with its slimy refuse as donnie walsh the respected president of the indiana pacers said the other day every time i start in on this subject i say how i wish more kids would stay in school but the more i talk about it the more i give myself a headache who would n't given the bewildering debate over amateur practices that are long dead and a sleazy system that subverts more than serves the integrity of higher education yet the myth continues to reflexively be spread especially in march that any time spent on campus developing game skills and social graces will produce the better player and more well adjusted adult despite a mountain of nba evidence to the contrary certainly the pool of college prepped pros is much larger but let 's stick to a sampling of the higher echelon allen iverson played at georgetown but never learned the value of attending practice chris webber swore his allegiance to michigan but may not have learned to tell the truth under oath rasheed wallace left north carolina with no respect for authority shaquille o'neal departed from louisiana state without sensitivity training these recent social offenders do n't even address the number of madness alumni who have gone on to lead dysfunctional lives conversely when was the last time a jumper from high school or a european kid who turned pro at 16 was led away in handcuffs or much less lashed out against his coach the way jay williams a duke grad did this week in chicago meanwhile baby bulls tyson chandler and eddy curry without a college credit to their names quietly go through their growing pains in indiana on donnie walsh 's team three who cut college jermaine o'neal al harrington and jonathan bender conduct themselves like men as walsh put it meanwhile ron artest a st john 's two year man karate chops everything in his path frankly i 'm surprised and i marvel at the maturity the kids who have come straight from high school show walsh said but i think after they made tough decisions and the problem of money was removed they could just commit themselves to becoming responsible pros the teams have also done well in surrounding them with veterans and former players to show them the right way to behave in college overcompensated operators like harrick hire their sons to teach rigged courses called coaching principles and strategies of basketball is n't that what practice is for too often the most profound lessons learned by the big men on campus are about temptation instant gratification and ultimately degradation the college game still benefits many but with the notable exception of one troubled soul leon smith those who have skipped it are hardly living to regret it bryant garnett and mcgrady already represent the nba 's best and brightest and although kwame brown for one may never be that good the courses he is taking with professor michael jordan in washington sure beat the curriculum at exploit u
