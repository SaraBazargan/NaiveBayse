by a three vote margin the house early today approved a 22 trillion spending plan for the next fiscal year that would make room for the deep tax cuts president bush proposed and lead to deficits for the rest of this decade later today the senate rejected a move to reduce the president 's tax package by more than half but the senate postponed a final vote on its budget until next week the senate did vote to reduce the 726 billion 10 year tax cut the president wants by 100 billion and to hold the money in reserve to pay for the war against iraq and its aftermath the vote was not conclusive and could be overturned the white house has not yet asked congress to approve money for the war and administration officials have refused to say how much it might cost republicans said the president did not want his tax cut jeopardized by concerns about war costs but they said they expected him to make an initial request for money next week the house budget makes no allocation for the war or reconstruction costs the measures at issue are called budget resolutions they are planning measures and do not carry the force of law but the resolutions have some political significance because they establish general guidelines for the tax and spending legislation congress will deal with for the rest of the year the tax provisions are especially important because they establish the amount the senate can later consider in tax legislation under procedures prohibiting filibusters the house passed its version about 3 am by a vote of 215 to 212 voting in favor were 214 republicans and one democrat voting against it were 12 republicans 199 democrats and one independent in the senate the 50 hours of debate allotted under rules expired thursday night the senate spent all day today in what is known as a vote a rama one vote after another on amendments with only a minute or so in between when the sponsor was permitted to describe the amendment the only significant amendment approved today was one offered this morning by senator russell d feingold democrat of wisconsin that lowered the bush tax cut to 626 billion and set aside 100 billion for war costs we are in a war and the budget must reflect it mr feingold argued senator don nickles republican of oklahoma the chairman of the budget committee responded that congress had never financed wars in advance and that it was impossible to know now what this one would cost three republicans john mccain of arizona susan collins of maine and lincoln chafee of rhode island joined democrats in voting for the measure at the end the republican leader senator bill frist of tennessee also voted for the measure so that under the rules he would be free to move later to reconsider the vote and have a new one the two plans are quite different in their details the differences will be worked out in a house senate conference committee both plans would supposedly balance the budget eventually the house plan in 2012 and the senate measure in 2013 but they would achieve that balance with much tighter limits on spending in years ahead than the politicians have ever found acceptable when time came to put them into effect democratic senators and representatives argued that it was ill advised to cut taxes in the face of war and large budget deficits the republican budget is reckless and irresponsible declared representative nancy pelosi of california the minority leader the deficits said representative john m spratt jr of south carolina the top democrat on the budget committee would do devastating damage but republican leaders in the house were able to hold their slim majorities in line by appealing for loyalty to the president at a closed meeting of republican members on thursday speaker j dennis hastert and other leaders said it was crucial not to hand the president an embarrassing defeat at the outbreak of the war the house republican leaders also rewrote their plan to restore cuts planned for medicare and to set aside 400 billion over 10 years for prescription drug coverage on the final vote early this morning the leaders used their influence to engineer a few last minutes switches that enabled their budget plan to prevail in the senate most of the tension all week revolved around an amendment to lower the allowable 10 year tax cut to 350 billion from 726 billion the measure was offered by four senators two republicans and two democrats who call themselves moderates after considerable anguish liberal democrats who oppose any tax cut at all decided to support the amendment as the lesser of evils that meant the outcome hung on the votes of two other senators who also want no tax cut mr mccain and ernest f hollings democrat of south carolina mr hollings and mr mccain could not be persuaded to vote for the measure so many of the liberal democrats decided to vote against an amendment that was going to be defeated anyway and it was rejected 62 to 38 arguing in favor of the amendment one of the sponsors senator john b breaux democrat of louisiana declared that it was reasonable and more balanced than what the republicans wanted we are at war mr breaux asserted cutting taxes at a time of uncertainty he continued is not a responsible course but senator charles e grassley republican of iowa argued when those men and women come home from the battlefield we want to grow the economy so those men and women will have jobs
