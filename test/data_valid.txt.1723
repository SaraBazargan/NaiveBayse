in the olympics there is the quaint notion that the fight game can be domesticated headgear is worn fights are short and savage knockouts are few but it is still boxing and that means that sooner or later there will be a judging controversy and intrigue over scoring decisions the latest dispute involved the unexpected defeat friday of light flyweight brian viloria a gold medal favorite for the united states the viloria decision left united states coach tom mustin wondering if there was a movement afoot to limit the success of the united states team which has 8 fighters alive in the 12 divisions of the olympic tournament i do n't know if they want one team to come in and have 9 or 10 guys progress round after round said mustin whose fighters have also been heartily booed at the boxing venue during the last two days other countries want to get gold medals too and they 're going to have to get them from somewhere after viloria lost his close fight on points mustin suggested that the dozens of body punches viloria threw at his opponent brahim asloum of france were not counting in the scoring by the five judges it is a longstanding belief in international amateur boxing that north american judges more influenced by professional boxing where a premium is placed on power punching tend to give fighters credit for blows to the stomach and ribs while judges from other parts of the world do not there is plenty of room for interpretation on whether a punch landed or not but it is true that neither viloria nor asloum received a point for a body shot in their bout when the judges score a punch as a point it is registered on video tape and of the dozens of punches these two speedy small fighters threw in four rounds the judges registered only six punches landed for asloum and four punches landed for viloria all blows to the head if brian 's body shots had counted mustin said he would have been ahead by 5 points the five judges for the viloria asloum fight were from south korea germany tahiti the dominican republic and algeria early today in a press conference with reporters loring baker the general secretary of the amateur international boxing association said he thought viloria 's punches to the body should have counted it may have been coincidental but suddenly today during many bouts body shots were indeed being counted in the scoring this change did not have much effect on the americans who fought today as the united states team bounced back from viloria 's disheartening defeat with two victories in three fights ricardo juarez last year 's featherweight world champion won a tough second round fight with germany 's falk huste 17 15 huste and juarez were given credit for punches to the body light middleweight jermain taylor followed his knockout in a first round fight earlier this week with another dominating performance taylor outpointed canada 's scott macintosh 23 9 the american super heavyweight calvin brock who was not considered a medal favorite lost his first fight of the olympics to paolo vidoz of italy 21 5 vidoz built part of his early lead by punching to brock 's body but viloria 's loss was still a hot topic at ringside even if mustin said the united states team declined to lodge a protest sometimes you protest a decision and it makes things worse he said we had to think of the whole team too we 've got a lot of guys left if the judges have adjusted their scoring philosophy after the viloria loss it appeased mustin but not entirely i do believe the judges have consistently identified the winner of the fights he said it 's been good but it can be arbitrary when it comes to what they 're counting and not counting more puzzling to mustin is how unpopular his boxers have become inside the boxing venue at sydney 's busy darling harbor as the olympic boxing tournament moves into the latter rounds and attendance increases the crowds have turned vociferous in their disdain for the americans since the americans boxers are considered favorites in many divisions it is not unusual that the fans of boxers from other countries are rooting against the americans but the many australian fans in attendance whose boxers have not fared well have added to the anti american cheering and american fans at the venue are a small minority taylor overwhelmed his canadian opponent but he was hooted out of the ring when his lopsided decision was announced brock 's loss tonight to an italian brought about a standing ovation from the crowd by far the loudest fan reaction in the eight days of boxing in the venue i do n't know why there 's such an anti american crowd mustin said we 're not coming out of the locker room cocky we 're trying to be quiet and humble taylor and juarez both said they felt it was important to win their bouts today after friday 's disappointments before viloria lost the american david jackson also was disqualified from the tournament because he failed to make the 132 pound lightweight limit friday took a piece out of all of us because brian was like the backbone of the team taylor said i 'm sorry for brian but the show must go on now that 's somebody who understands boxing
