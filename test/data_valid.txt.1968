to the editor re volunteers gather to count the city 's homeless news article feb 25 i have represented the homeless in new york city for more than 20 years during that time i have never given an estimate of the numbers of the homeless to do so would be irresponsible and ultimately misleading we simply can not count the homeless in abandoned buildings rooftops tunnels and hallways the city 's effort to count the homeless does not include any of these areas to further complicate matters most of my clients do not look homeless and will not be counted we do know for sure however that tens of thousands of new yorkers will sleep outside or in a shelter tonight this fact alone is sufficient to dictate public policy douglas lasdon executive director urban justice center new york feb 26 2003
