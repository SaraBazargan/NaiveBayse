the united states has the largest and most expensive prison system in the world the inmate population has grown by nearly 80 percent over the last decade partly because more than half the inmates commit new crimes soon after release and quickly end up back inside two new reports from prison study groups suggest that mentally ill inmates are prime candidates not just for recidivism but for destructive behavior and suicide when prisons fail to handle them properly the studies by human rights watch and the correctional association of new york show that prisons have actually become mental institutions by default but they have largely failed to develop treatment programs that would permit mentally ill inmates to establish a routine that would allow them to control their symptoms and their lives the correctional association study offers a grim picture of the new york prison system where according to state data nearly a quarter of prisoners in disciplinary lockdown confined to a small cell 23 hours a day are mentally ill the prisoners are sent to lockdown for failing to obey prison rules easy to understand given that many of these men and women suffer hallucinations and delusions that get worse when they are sent into confinement lockdowns require fewer corrections officers and are therefore cheaper to run but psychiatrists have long known that severely punitive measures do not work with psychotic inmates and often cause them to act out their frustrations even more nearly 45 percent of the prisoners in the new york study reported that they had tried suicide more than a third reported self mutilation and 20 percent had been previously admitted to a psychiatric hospital when their prison terms are finished these inmates are dumped onto the streets where they become a hazard to themselves and to the community these reports deserve to be widely read in congress and in state legislatures where lawmakers are just waking up to a serious problem
