there were cheers in havana when former president jimmy carter said the american trade embargo should be lifted before fidel castro 's government makes democratic reforms a few days later there were cheers in miami when president bush vowed to keep the embargo unless mr castro first makes democratic reforms caught between those positions american businesses for whom cuba has been tantalizingly close yet officially off limits for four decades were left to wonder about the future john s kavulich ii president of the us cuba trade and economic council a business organization in new york that focuses on cuba without taking political positions spoke last week about the outlook anthony depalma q is the embargo any closer to ending now than it was before mr carter 's visit a yes the relationship between the two countries really is about moments president carter 's visit was a significant moment but it was not a seminal moment the relationship will continue to change incrementally because that 's the way both governments seem to want it to change q if the embargo were lifted tomorrow which american companies would get a running start a some that will be active in the future are active now they are commodities companies like archer daniels midland riceland foods gold kist inc and about 18 others that have sold food to cuba since late last year there also are branded food companies that have n't sold anything yet but are likely to do so they include rjr nabisco pepsico and mars which owns uncle ben 's rice a prerevolutionary favorite in cuba other american companies that have affiliates or relationships with companies in cuba will be well positioned to move fast they include general motors ford daimler chrysler ge microsoft and the carlson companies which control radisson hotels and tgi friday 's restaurants western union att worldcom and sprint all provide some communications services today and while mcdonald 's has no operations in cuba now its global corporate strategy to always be first into new markets means that it can be expected to be among the first to go in q you mentioned resumption of cash only american food sales how does cuba pay a the 90 million worth of food and agricultural products purchased by cuba during the last seven months have reduced cuba 's overall purchases from its existing suppliers by 90 million some of the funds that cuba has used to pay us companies have come from funds that were supposed to have been directed toward paying current creditors that means suppliers in canada france brazil argentina spain and other countries are not enthusiastic about having some of what is owed to them being used to gain political influence in the united states q cuba has 112 million people and poverty is serious what makes cuba so attractive to american companies a cuban awareness of us brand names is among the highest for any non english speaking country which makes the cuban market immensely attractive for some us companies and because so many cubans have family members in the us their purchasing decisions are going to be influenced by that familiarity with certain brands the unrestricted trade relationship between the us and cuba will likely be 80 percent us exports to cuba only certain products like beverages tobacco citrus coffee and perhaps some health care products will be exported to the united states sugar producers in florida and louisiana along with citrus producers in florida and california are not going to be enthusiastic about additional competition q president bush said trading with cuba helps keep mr castro in power are american sellers of food to cuba aiding a dictator a the overwhelming majority of the food products purchased during the last seven months have been used by the 112 million inhabitants of cuba not the 18 million foreign tourists who visited cuba and left behind us dollars that may well help sustain a system of government that president bush finds uh unproductive
