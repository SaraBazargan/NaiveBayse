pakistan is preparing to shift troops from the border with afghanistan where they are engaged in the hunt for qaeda and taliban fighters to the front in kashmir where tensions with india are quickly rising the government said today the announcement underscored the competing interests not only for pakistan and india but also for the united states between ferreting out terrorist remnants while securing the region against the possibility of a full blown war between the nuclear armed rivals india and pakistan have a total of a million troops already massed along their 1800 mile border threats of war from indian leaders have grown increasingly shrill since an attack which they ascribe to pakistan based islamic militants killed 35 people in kashmir last week for the last six days thousands of people have reportedly filed out of the region as the two armies have shelled each other with mounting intensity across the dividing line in kashmir where india and pakistan have fought two past wars today pakistani officials said that they had placed the capital islamabad on a war footing if the troops are shifted by pakistan the move would constitute a serious blow to washington 's efforts to wipe out qaeda and taliban diehards in the rugged and lawless border region between pakistan and afghanistan we are concerned defense secretary donald h rumsfeld said in an interview on cnn we could be getting a lot more help from the pakistanis if there were not the tense situation with respect to the two countries mr rumsfeld said they have forces along the indian borders that we could use along the afghan border and it 's unfortunate experts have suggested that india 's leaders may be using bellicose language in an effort to get the united states to press pakistan to end what they regard as a 20 year campaign of terrorism to drive india from kashmir india 's only predominantly muslim state at the same time the frustrations that indian officials have expressed over what they see as a double standard in america 's campaign against terror are undoubtedly real they have accused pakistan 's president gen pervez musharraf of a double agenda cooperating with the united states in its fight against islamic terrorists in afghanistan while supporting similar groups in a holy war in kashmir the rising threats have indeed captured american attention secretary of state colin l powell reportedly spoke with general musharraf twice by telephone today to urge pakistan to halt incursions from its territory into the two thirds of the disputed region controlled by india at the state department a spokesman philip reeker said that deputy secretary of state richard l armitage would leave for the region but not until june 4 mr reeker repeated that officials were seriously concerned about the potential for conflict between india and pakistan and about the danger of that conflict spiraling out of control we understand india 's frustrations and anger over continued terrorist actions he said but would reiterate that rather than being the solution military action in this crisis would create even greater problems he called on india and pakistan to resume talks over the issues that divide them and that includes kashmir an idea that india 's prime minister atal behari vajpayee specifically rejected today though today he seemed to equivocate mr vajpayee on a visit on wednesday to srinagar the capital of indian held kashmir told troops there to prepare for a decisive battle maj gen rashid qureshi the pakistani government spokesman said that the troop movements if they occur would not reflect a change in pakistan 's support for america 's drive against al qaeda but he also laid the responsibility for any redeployment at india 's feet the indians have massed a very large force in kashmir and if they continue to escalate their rhetoric and intensify their fire as they have been we will have to shift emphasis and focus exclusively on our eastern borders he said india has continued to escalate despite the fact that pakistan has said that all issues should be resolved peacefully he added they continue to target our civilian populations and they are threatening pakistan with a war which they say they will win as part of its preparations for a possible war the pakistani government also said that it would recall about 4500 troops from sierra leone where they have formed the backbone of the united nations peacekeeping operation in the west african nation pakistan also called up all civil defense volunteers in the capital islamabad and ordered firefighting and first aid and rescue drills in anticipation of a clash with india according to the state run app news agency all departments and ministries have been directed to update their contingency plans immediately to deal with any emergency situation the news agency reported after a meeting called by the head of the civil defense force the pakistani government has tried ever more strenuously in recent days to present a conciliatory face in the crisis repeatedly urging india to accept dialogue and offering to place international monitors on the line of control that separated the two armies in kashmir after a meeting late wednesday the government specified for the first time that it would not allow any part of pakistani held kashmir to be used a base for attacks against indian troops by muslim separatists but mr vajpayee said today that india had heard such promises before and wanted to see action pakistan also said that it had written to the united nations secretary general kofi annan and to the security council urging them to press india to begin talks to end the military standoff mr annan 's office released a statement today that appeared to be aimed at keeping the pressure on general musharraf to demonstrate his commitment first made in a speech on jan 12 to crack down on islamic militants based in pakistan including those waging war in kashmir pakistan arrested hundreds of islamic extremists after general musharraf 's speech and reportedly shut down camps operated by kashmiri separatists but subsequently most of the militants were released and india claims that incursions from pakistan have again been on the rise there can be no tolerance for such acts especially across the line of control in kashmir the statement said the secretary general accordingly urges president musharraf to take vigorous action to ensure full implementation of the policy set out in his speech of jan 12 general musharraf made the speech under heavy american pressure after india had moved thousands of troops to the border and threatened war in response to a suicide attack on its parliament that left 14 people dead in december the attack initiated the military buildup and the months of tensions between the two nations in the months since indian officials have repeatedly pledged that they would strike if pakistan did not end infiltrations and attacks by militants who have used pakistan as a staging ground
