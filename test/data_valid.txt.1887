in 1997 four school board members in this upper middle class chicago suburb ran for re election against challengers who said that test scores were high but not high enough we always answered that test scores do n't tell the whole story recalled dean krone a lawyer who retained his seat in that election but we began to wonder 'what is the rest of the story the question led the board to define a fuller range of school goals and ask how progress toward them might be measured the district now hopes to create an index of outcomes in which test scores are one but not the only one this may be at odds with a national test score emphasis although it is easier for park ridge to explore radical approaches because its affluent students get good scores with relatively little effort still the american public as a whole in polls and focus groups says schools should place higher priorities on goals like good citizenship than on test scores and another park ridge board member john pierce an actuary complains that national and state leaders want to hold schools accountable only for results that are easy to measure scores are important said a third member of the board jane meagher a management consultant but in our middle schools bullying is a bigger problem would n't it be wonderful to measure a decrease in bullying the district is now trying to do just that three years ago superintendent fred schroeder asked each school to define an academic area on which to focus at lincoln middle school faculty and parents proposed emotional intelligence dr schroeder and his board were skeptical we really did n't think this was an academic goal he remembered but the lincoln team gave each board member a copy of daniel goleman 's emotional intelligence bantam books 1995 and the board 's view of educational ends evolved now trust stress management and other emotional skills are explicitly taught at the district 's middle schools last month for example sixth graders had lessons in anger management the pupils wrote about quarrels they had experienced and then teachers led discussions on how to handle the anger by talking with adults trying to imagine how the other person feels counting to 10 ann deacon a math teacher says this focus has also helped her weave emotional skills explicitly into academic lessons sixth graders she says typically want answers right away and resent having to take time to figure them out so when ms deacon recently asked her pupils for the sum of angles in a polygon she gave out pattern blocks of isosceles and right triangles as the pupils struggled for the right combinations she discussed with them the value of perseverance and patience in the end they learned geometry not only more thoroughly but also with more satisfaction which she hopes will inspire patience in other situations such teaching is not so unusual more remarkable is the district 's determination to measure results and by adopting the planned index of outcomes to weigh their importance against that of test scores to measure emotional growth attitudinal testing was considered but rejected instead schools plan to track the number of student fights and detentions the true gauge of course is lifelong behavior not school disciplinary cases this is no different from assessing performance in traditional academic areas for which the district also seeks better measures whether students in later life join oprah 's book club is a better indicator of middle school reading instruction than how they interpreted test passages at age 11 and voting participation along with history tests might be an indicator of social studies teaching dr schroeder the superintendent also hopes to judge elementary instruction by how students later do on college entrance exams this requires a data system that unusual in american education codes high school records by the primary schools students attended the park ridge endeavor is fraught with difficulties how should objectives rank in importance taking instructional time to teach emotional intelligence means less time for something else is a 10 percent decline in bullying worth a 5 percentile increase in science scores or more board members will have to be cautious that goals they adopt truly reflect community values it may seem obvious that schools should teach children to respect others but some parents may feel that explicit curriculum for such behavior infringes on family responsibility as a result while all schools teach values fewer acknowledge doing so still there is a growing national backlash over what many parents and teachers consider excessive focus on standardized tests park ridge is a rare place where educators not only complain about test driven accountability but are seeking an alternative lessons e mail rrothstein nytimescom
