with the presidency at stake election supervisors in each of florida 's 67 counties today began a recount of the nearly 6 million votes for president in tuesday 's election but clay roberts the state 's director of elections said he did not anticipate a significant change in the initial tally that showed gov george w bush slightly ahead katherine harris the secretary of state said she expected to declare a winner based on the recount by the end of business on thursday but democrats suggested that they might try to delay a resolution by filing lawsuits under florida law a recount is automatically undertaken when an election is decided by less than one half of one percent of the total vote in the presidential race here the final initial count early this morning by the division of elections showed mr bush ahead of vice president al gore by 1784 votes 003 percent of the 5950069 votes cast the winner gains the state 's 25 electoral votes and wins the presidency talking to reporters this morning mr roberts the division 's director an appointed post said statewide recounts were rare but he said that countywide recounts were fairly common and that the final outcome rarely varied more than five or six votes from the initial tally even in a county the size of miami dade the state 's most populous still if an average of 27 votes a county shifted to mr gore from mr bush mr gore would win ms harris an elected republican who is mr roberts 's supervisor said that the recount was routine done automatically by computer it 's just a matter of adding the numbers she said all the counties except one union a rural county in north florida count ballots electronically of the counties that reported their recount results to the state government today before the elections office closed for the night 16 showed small changes in their tallies added together the changes gave mr bush 125 more votes and mr gore 133 a net gain for mr gore of 8 votes across the state election workers began recounting ballots they had first counted on tuesday night in orlando the operation was slowed by quirky write ins smudges left by the rubber rollers from the first time ballots were counted and ballot cards the machine had shredded or folded in deland in central florida a county judge sealed the election headquarters with police tape in tampa pam iorio the hillsborough county elections supervisor said that she did not expect big changes but that some were likely because of hanging shard syndrome when the tiny squares voters punch out to select their candidates cling to the ballot so that it does not register properly it was not clear tonight whether absentee ballots could delay the final count all the ballots mailed in the united states are part of the initial count mr roberts said but floridians who live abroad only need their ballots postmarked by nov 7 state law requires they be counted if officials receive them by nov 17 there is no statewide record of how many ballots were requested by people abroad how many have already been received and counted or how many might still be submitted after the 1996 presidential election mr roberts said about 2300 absentee ballots arrived from overseas republicans maintained that most such ballots would come from military personnel who were likely to vote for mr bush democrats said that many in the military were enlistees and members of minority groups likely to vote for mr gore also democrats said there could be many floridians who live in israel and they would probably vote democratic the truth is no one knows both parties have sent in teams of lawyers and others to monitor the recount and its aftermath the teams leaders are prominent former united states secretaries of state james a baker iii for the republicans and warren christopher for the democrats democrats suggested that the outcome might be affected by partisan finagling in a state where mr bush 's brother jeb is governor and almost all other top officials are republicans the democrats threatened to file lawsuits if the results of the recount were unfavorable but they offered no specifics and no evidence buddy mackay a former democratic lieutenant governor who lost a 1988 senate race by a razor thin margin to senator connie mack said democrats could not afford to concede such an important election i do n't think anybody ought to walk away from it he said i think we ought to stay and get it right bob poe the state democratic chairman declared certainly there are questions about partiality we 're not making any suggestions but we 're looking at that florida does not have much history of election fraud county election supervisors usually operate without partisanship and often serve for long periods regardless of which party controls the county government this afternoon gov jeb bush withdrew from any role in the recount under state law when the counties election returns get to tallahassee they are to be certified by the governor secretary of state and director of the elections division mr bush said the elections division would name his replacement rather than partisan chicanery the democrats biggest complaint concerned the ballot design in one county where the election supervisor is a democrat and even mr poe seemed to agree that nothing could be done about it in florida each county designs its own ballot in palm beach a heavily democratic county the punch card ballot was constructed in such a way that mr gore 's name was directly across from that of patrick j buchanan the reform party candidate some voters complained they had mistakenly voted for mr buchanan while meaning to vote for mr gore the initial tally showed that mr gore carried the county by more than 110000 votes but that mr buchanan received 3407 votes more than triple the number he drew in any other county in the state representative robert wexler a democrat from the area said the complaints came largely from elderly voters most of whom were jewish and loyal democrats it is inconceivable that many people voted for pat buchanan in my district he said there is no doubt there was mass confusion at the ballot box mr roberts the election official did not disagree that the ballots were confusing but he said all candidates on the ballot had a chance to review them no complaints were raised before they were printed and disadvantaged candidates had no recourse now an expert on election law professor daniel lowenstein of the university of california at los angeles law school said it was highly unlikely that the courts would agree to review the case i expect courts to take a pretty standoffish view of things like this and i 'd be surprised to find a judge who would intervene he said it 's not an inherently defective ballot mr lowenstein added since no one was asserting that it was anything but poorly designed
