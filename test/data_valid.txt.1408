to honor an old friend al davis was wearing his full dress uniform black suit black shirt silver tie below his fonz haircut his glasses hung from a silver cord the oakland raiders managing general genius davis had taken a timeout from the super bowl circus he had arrived outside qualcomm stadium for today 's unveiling of a 13 foot bronze statue of jack murphy the former sports editor and columnist of the san diego union who seduced the chargers into coming here from los angeles in 1961 and later helped create baseball 's padres at 73 davis walks slowly and carefully now but he still has that fast frozen smile that makes you wonder what he 's really thinking except for surveying the raiders practices as the only current national football league owner who was once a head coach davis will mostly hibernate at his team 's la jolla hotel this week so this was a rare appearance and a local businessman who apparently knew davis as a chargers assistant coach four decades ago hurried to greet him is there anybody at your hotel who might have two tickets that i could come there and pick up the local man said there 's a lot of people there with two tickets davis said you tell me how great i am then you ask for two tickets davis turned away to talk to others then he sat in the front row as the ceremony began herb klein the editor in chief of copley newspapers who had organized the statue dedication mentioned how murphy had been such a close friend of davis 's he had written a book titled damn you al davis that 's a close friend davis piped up smiling soon other speakers told how murphy more than any other person had been responsible for san diego being in the big leagues how other stadiums have statues of say hank aaron and stan musial and ty cobb but murphy with his black labrador abe of spoon river is the first sportswriter to be so honored jack murphy dared me to dream davis was saying now at the lectern he would come to los angeles in 1960 when hardly anybody was watching us in the coliseum there and he 'd say 'how about san diego why ca n't this team be moved to san diego i thought it was a good idea i 'm a guy for moving teams that brought a laugh davis moved the raiders to los angeles in 1982 then moved them back to oakland in 1995 on sunday against tampa bay the raiders will be trying to win their fourth super bowl the idea is to be no 1 the idea is to win davis continued his raiders ring with three large diamonds flashing on his left ring finger jack murphy wanted to win for san diego someday i 'd like to see a stadium with a million people in it all the people from the american football league marching like they do at the olympics the san diego group in the parade would be led by barron hilton and sid gillman he continued referring to the chargers original owner and coach and jack murphy would be carrying the flag of san diego and holding the leash of abe of spoon river the great ones like jack should never be forgotten never never never now it was time to unveil the statue sculpted by a wasil whose bronze busts of san diego sports figures adorn the stadium 's interior mayor dick murphy no relation turning to davis asked him to come closer for the photographers as he untied the gold cord around the gold cloth but davis who contributed to the cost of the statue moved in slowly almost reluctantly i wish you were presenting me with another super bowl trophy he told the mayor as the cloth slid off the statue davis moved toward the golf cart waiting for him but a few reporters and television cameras encircled him i do n't know if my hair is combed he said can we ask you two questions one said if it 's about jim plunkett and tom flores yes he said referring to the quarterback and coach of the last two raiders teams to win the super bowl otherwise no what do you think of jon gruden being the bucs coach we 've had so many of our great assistant coaches become head coaches he said not answering the question bill walsh the great john madden tom flores art shell none of 'em had ever been a head coach before davis hired gruden as the raiders coach in 1998 but despite a 50 30 record over four seasons their relationship soured the bucs paid davis 's price 8 million two first round choices two second round choices you believe in players do n't you he was saying now i believe in an organization he said growing up in brooklyn i read eight newspapers about an organization the yankees with george weiss the dodgers with branch rickey that was inspirational are you happy for jon gruden another persisted i 'm happy for the raiders being here he said without a smile we just want to win al davis walked away his timeout was over he had to return to the super bowl circus
