to the editor re is home care really working editorial july 8 about a government report critical of the quality of home and community based care under medicaid waivers people with disabilities have pushed for medicaid waivers because the conditions in nursing homes are often inhumane and unsafe people forced to live in these institutional warehouses regularly suffer from open wounds lack proper nutrition and lie in their own filth for hours i know a little something about this issue i am 38 disabled and receive 24 hour care in the community as an attorney i frequently represent people who want to get out of nursing homes surely there are some quality problems in the home care system but many people are willing to take that risk the government should not delay giving medicaid waivers or else more people will waste away in institutions thomas k small brooklyn july 9 2003
