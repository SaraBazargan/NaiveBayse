you may not know me but until last week i was the highest ranking member of the bush administration who is openly gay that was n't my official title of course as a holdover appointee from the previous administration i served for two weeks as president bush 's acting administrator of the small business administration i left office as a matter of protocol to clear the decks for the new president 's choice it 's not yet clear who will inherit my unofficial title but no single appointment matters as much as whether the new administration opens its doors to the many gay and lesbian americans who are eager and able to serve their country bill clinton as a candidate for president was fond of saying that he wanted a government that looked like america his administration was indeed diverse with more women and members of ethnic minorities appointed to the highest levels of government than ever before this vision of diversity was broad enough to include gay men and lesbians president clinton appointed a record number of openly gay americans to serve on his white house staff and throughout the government he also issued two landmark executive orders one that banned discrimination in the federal government 's civilian work force on the basis of sexual orientation and another that ended the 50 year ban on granting security clearances to gay men and lesbians the inclusion of a large number of gay appointees in the clinton administration was an accomplishment but a greater measure of achievement is the extent to which gay officials are now seen by others in government as colleagues not as curiosities or worse whether we have worked to promote the interests of small businesses and entrepreneurs as i have or advised the president on issues like labor and trade or worked to transform intellectual property laws for the information age openly gay officials have been doing the nation 's business and we 've made it well almost normal to be gay and in the government president bush appears to share his predecessor 's understanding that our nation 's diversity is our greatest strength i hope his commitment to diversity runs more than cabinet deep and that he will give a sign that gays and lesbians are welcome as part of the bush team the new administration is reviewing the executive orders currently in place that ban discrimination based on sexual orientation it is important that president bush keep this policy in place which is a simple commitment to allow qualified and talented individuals to serve without bias by doing so the federal government will keep step with mainstream america where openly gay people are increasingly accepted as part of the work force the administration 's decision on this issue is a true test of diversity this is not the time to return to the dark old days when gay men and lesbians were forced to be outsiders in the eyes of their own government fred p hochberg served in the small business administration from 1998 to 2001 as deputy administrator and then acting administrator
