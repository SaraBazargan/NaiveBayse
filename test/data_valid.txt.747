in an atmosphere as highly charged as the summer air before a thunderstorm vermont 's new commissioner of education has been carrying a message of respect for diversity to the schools of this state in late october david s wolk who took over the vermont department of education in february delivered the keynote address at a school convention held every two years here in rutland the state 's second largest city he began by issuing a challenge to the assembled students from three area schools look at the person to your left look at the person to the your right if you know them think about who they are and what they mean to you if you do n't know them maybe you should he said that humans are members of one big family and asked since we are all related to each other as brothers and sisters do n't you think we could be less prejudiced more understanding and less biased in our treatment of each other it is a message mr wolk has conveyed in a variety of forms to a variety of audiences and at another time his speech might have attracted little attention outside education circles indeed mr wolk 51 said his message had been consistent throughout his long career as a teacher guidance counselor principal and school superintendent there 's nothing new about this message he said i talk to kids about this all the time schools must provide safe civil orderly environments that are conducive to learning that means everybody in the community must feel safe but in the climate of civil strife that has developed over vermont 's civil unions law which affords the legal benefits of marriage to same sex couples mr wolk drew much outside attention when he asked why do we allow such hurtful criticism of our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters by making crass and painful jokes at the expense of those whose sexual orientation is so threatening to us why is homophobia such a common form of harassment in our schools and in our society response to the message was mixed even among roman catholic educators although the church has made clear its opposition to homosexuality in general and civil unions in particular john mccarthy lay principal of the rice memorial high school a large catholic high school in burlington said he understood mr wolk to be making a statement about school safety all of us in education are in favor of safe schools but tony cirelli assistant principal of mount st joseph academy here one of the participating schools said the academy held a follow up assembly we wanted to let our students know that we had no idea what mr wolk would talk about he said his address did make some of our students and parents uncomfortable as a catholic community our position is that we may love the individuals but we do not accept the act fans of the speech included mr wolk 's boss and longtime friend gov howard dean diversity is the future of this country and it 's very important that we all learn how to walk in someone else 's shoes mr dean said in fact mr wolk 's speech covered far more than homophobia he also asked audience members to examine their attitudes about religious ethnic racial and gender differences we live in the whitest state in the country and there is racism and intolerance just below the surface he said the heat sparked by the civil unions law which took effect july 1 has reached every aspect of vermont life the law was pivotal in tuesday 's elections resulting in a takeover of the vermont house by republicans who were largely opposed to the law it thrust mr dean a democrat who supported the law into a difficult re election campaign he won with a slim majority mr wolk does not deny that his campaign for respect has cost him something personally although he is reluctant to talk about it but he says i 've had a lot of kids come up to me with knowing looks and say 'thank you they tell me it has made a difference in the climate of the schools
