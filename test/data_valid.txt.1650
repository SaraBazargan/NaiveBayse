failing schools that received extra resources for smaller classes longer school days and more teacher training had higher scores on standardized tests than similar schools that did not get the same kind of help according to a study released yesterday by the new york city schools chancellor harold o levy the timing of the report seemed calculated to influence contract negotiations under way between the giuliani administration and the board of education and the united federation of teachers the union contends that the city is losing teachers to suburbs where salaries are up to 25 percent higher and is seeking substantial wage increases mayor rudolph w giuliani in turn is seeking productivity increases the 39 schools in the study were taken over by the chancellor in june 1999 because of their chronically low performance and were given infusions of 500000 to 1 million more than their usual budgets when the so called extended time plan was negotiated some education officials predicted that if it were a success the teachers union would use it as an argument for raising teacher salaries citywide the more than 1000 teachers who participated got a 15 percent raise for working 40 more minutes a day the study compared the 39 schools in the program with roughly the same number of schools that were also designated as low performing by the state but were not taken over by the chancellor or given any extra help it found that reading scores improved 7 percentage points in the chancellor 's schools 5 points in other failing schools and 6 points citywide in math the chancellor 's schools gained 3 points the other failing schools 12 points and all schools 1 point at the same time the number of students scoring in the lowest of four levels shrank 125 percentage points in reading and 96 points in math in the chancellor 's schools and 10 points in reading and 5 points in math in other schools citywide the bottom level shrank five points in reading and three points in math this is the kind of information along with other studies that will shape our bargaining demands mr levy said yesterday the purpose of doing these research studies is to become a more data driven system so we 're not making multibillion dollar judgments on the basis of seat of the pants guesses but deputy mayor anthony p coles said the report showed that more time in school is important but not enough to turn schools around it is also important he said to have a curriculum that is designed to teach effectively and to have real accountability and oversight which he contended privately managed schools do better than public ones but randi weingarten president of the united federation of teachers said the data was a strong argument against using vouchers to send children to private schools it showed she said that given the proper resources public schools serving even the most disadvantaged children could be turned around not one by one but as a group the analysis did not try to separate the impact of more productivity the extra 40 minutes a day from other factors like a reduction in class size to 20 students from as many as 30 teacher training and new curriculums in two related reports also released yesterday mr levy found that teacher certification a hot issue in new york city where 14 percent of teachers were uncertified last year has less impact on test scores than a school 's ability to get students to show up these reports looked at all elementary and middle schools regardless of performance absenteeism is a persistent problem in some of the city 's poorest and least effective school districts where 10 percent of the students are habitually absent demographics alone students in poverty learning english and with behavior and learning problems accounted for more than 60 percent of the variation in test scores from school to school after taking demographics into account attendance accounted for 14 percent of the difference in test scores while teacher certification explained 44 percent of the variation in reading scores and 54 percent of the variation in math scores but after controlling for attendance and demographics the importance of certification dwindled to account for only two points of variation in scores it was not clear from the report whether the benefits of certification such as they were had to do with courses taken in education schools or more years of experience as a teacher in new york city certified teachers are more experienced as a group than those who are not certified the report did not attempt to compare similar teachers for instance certified teachers with one year of experience to uncertified teachers with one year of experience all three reports are published on the board of education web site wwwnycenetedu daa reports
