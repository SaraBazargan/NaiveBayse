for suzanne m murphy who makes about 90000 a year as a teacher and a consultant the roughly 400 more she will have to pay in property taxes on her three story home in the windsor terrace section of brooklyn is not the end of the world but for ms murphy and other residents of windsor terrace a mostly middle class neighborhood just south of park slope yesterday 's announcement that the city council had agreed to an 18 percent increase in the city 's property tax rate was still bitter medicine the amount was less important she said than the basic unfairness of the tax which she contended would hurt the poor and working class people far more than it would the rich i think this kind of increase should be more equitable she said the burdens really need to be borne by the people who make the big bucks others echoed that sentiment mayor michael r bloomberg is hitting the working and middle class too hard said amy wenger a homeowner who lives nearby with her husband and three children i think in order to maintain services we have to raise taxes but i think we also need to look at income taxes that affect wealthier people asked about the effect of the tax rate increase on her ms wenger said i ca n't afford it we both work and we have no extra income but we 'll figure something out mayor bloomberg initially proposed a 25 percent increase in the tax rate but under the agreement the city council speaker gifford miller announced yesterday the average single family home owner will pay 343 more in property taxes a year city officials said to tracy toscano who recently bought a new apartment in windsor terrace for just over 400000 the fact that the city 's property taxes are low compared with those in the suburbs and have not been raised in 10 years was no excuse we chose to live in a place with less property tax she said one of the reasons people do n't move to long island is property taxes the tax increase was just as unpopular with potential homeowners prices are outrageous and then to add on the tax it 's just too much for a family to handle said sheila mcbrien 37 who rents a two bedroom house with her husband and two children who 's got the money to pay for a 750000 house and put in renovations and pay this tax asked ms mcbrien whose husband works in the restaurant business while she takes care of the children she pointed out a for sale sign on the opposite side of windsor place asked if she was still actively looking for a house to buy she merely groaned for ms mcbrien the tax even had a faintly apocalyptic sound the first time the real depth of the city 's fiscal troubles were brought home god only knows what 's going to happen if we ca n't fix the deficit she said it could get worse but to some the news of the tax increase was much like yesterday 's sudden wintry weather nasty unpleasant but probably inevitable the mayor has to fix it so we just have to accept it said genevieve pynn grimly as she hurried to mass at the church of the holy name on prospect park west another churchbound homeowner charles gabbert was equally resigned if it means keeping open firehouses and preventing more cutbacks we can live with it he said it 's better than a sales tax or layoffs it 's ridiculous it 's terrible said borys fessak 68 as he stood with his dog outside the windsor place house where he lives with his wife and two of their five children but in the end nothing much will change we 'll squawk about it we 'll complain but life will go on
