the supreme court 's efforts to diminish the federal government 's authority over the states proceeded yesterday with a 5 to 4 decision holding that congress lacked the power to bind state governments to the federal law barring age discrimination in employment the decision was the first of five major rulings dealing with the fundamental constitutional issue of federalism the balance of power between the states and the federal government that are due from the court this term it held that the states sovereign immunity from suits in federal court shielded them from congress 's law against age discrimination in employment the ruling applies to employees of state governments these employees will no longer be able to seek redress in federal court under the age discrimination in employment act of 1967 instead they will have to make their case in state court relying on the often weaker protections provided by state age discrimination laws the ruling could conceivably call into question other existing civil rights laws like the americans with disabilities act in essence the decision substituted the court 's own judgment about the seriousness of the age discrimination problem for congress 's judgment in so doing it adopted a constricted view of congress 's traditional authority under the 14th amendment 's equal protection clause to define and legislate civil rights protection for vulnerable groups like older workers the decision was written by justice sandra day o'connor and joined by the other members of the court 's aggressive states rights cluster chief justice william rehnquist and justices antonin scalia clarence thomas and anthony kennedy rulings favorable to states rights are no longer surprising from this court even so both the majority and dissenting opinions were striking for the harshness of their wording the federalism issue is clearly a matter of profound debate on the court and the lines are beginning to harden in an angry but well reasoned dissent justice john paul stevens skewered the majority for ignoring the importance of respecting the framers decision to assign the business of lawmaking to the congress the framers he noted built important structural safeguards into the constitution by giving each state equal representation in the senate and apportioning the house along state lines to insure that the normal operation of the legislative process itself would adequately defend state interests from undue infringement americans concerned about preserving civil rights and congress 's legitimate role in providing national remedies to national problems had best brace themselves yesterday the justices also heard arguments in another important federalism case this one testing the constitutionality of the violence against women act the employment decision could well be a harbinger of other damaging federalism rulings to come
