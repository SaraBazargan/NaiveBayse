fifteen boys and girls from the step dance team at junior high school 231 in springfield gardens queens were chatting in the back of the school auditorium when lamont o'neil the team 's director announced that he was ready to start rehearsal they took off down the aisles hurriedly tucking their white shirts into their pants and skirts forming a circle onstage they bowed their heads and joined him in a prayer as they always do before a rehearsal how was your weekend mr o'neil asked a girl answered laughing groovy that was the last bit of levity for the next two and a half hours as mr o'neil a combination of drill sergeant choreographer and big brother put the team through its paces to the hip hop beat of the gospel singer kirk franklin 's he reigns the youngsters in three lines ran through their routines in rapid fire movements slapping their hands on their hips stomach and legs crossing and recrossing their arms later the dancers chanted we are the children of righteousness imbuing their stepping with a spirituality mr o'neil and his team were preparing for the competition that will take place today at the hammerstein ballroom in manhattan as a part of this year 's mcdonald 's gospelfest begun by the fast food chain in several black churches in los angeles in 1984 it now travels around the country this year stopping in 11 cities in addition to performances by hezekiah walker and the love fellowship tabernacle choir vickie winans and cissy houston it features competitions between choir groups soloists and christian rappers as well as those in step dancing and praise dancing another form of black vernacular dance in july wabc channel 7 will broadcast a special with excerpts from the four events held in the new york area this brand of step dancing or stepping as it is familiarly known is not to be confused with irish step dancing stepping dates to the early 20th century when black veterans of world war i enrolled in colleges said thomas de frantz a professor of music and theater arts at the massachusetts institute of technology and the historian of the alvin ailey american dance theater they wanted to express their blackness through a communal art form of their own he said inspired by their military training they brought to their dances a highly rigorous drill like component and combined it with elements from other black dances just as today steppers often add hip hop movements stepping quickly took off in black fraternities and sororities becoming an integral part of the initiation with students holding fierce contests to demonstrate their originality spike lee 's 1988 film school daze brought stepping to a wider audience like much african american music and dance step dance relies on improvisation call and response complex meters propulsive rhythms and a percussive attack since it resembles the gumboot dance of south african miners some people theorize that it came to the united states directly from africa but mr de frantz said the two forms simply share african movements stepping can vary from the sexually suggestive to the reverential and until recently step teams were segregated by sex praise dancing began in baptist churches in the late 19th century a descendant of the ring shout a religious dance of west african origin traditional praise dances are performed in a circle or as processions sometimes accompanied by bugles and drums with the performers carrying flags and banners in contemporary praise dancing participants often in an ecstatic state inspired by their belief in god determine their own movements ailey used elements of it in his masterpiece revelations as did talley beatty in his work southern landscape praise dance has recently developed a lively second life as a highly choreographed concert dance and along with step dancing has become popular with community organizations as well as church and school groups curtis farrow a gospelfest producer said there 's been an explosion of interest among hispanics asians and whites who now make up 25 percent of the audience at the tri state events like mr o'neil 's 231 step academy team michael gary 's acrodanse theater company a modern dance troupe from perth amboy nj that performs praise dance was a champion at last year 's mcdonald 's gospelfest and will be returning this year to defend its title before a recent performance at the nicholas musical center at rutgers university in new brunswick nj mr gary 41 talked about praise dancing which he first saw as a child at his grandparents church in virginia i use gestures and movements i recall from that time in my choreography he said there 's never any set style or technique in praise dancing it 's about worshiping god in your own manner to a recording of john t kee singing praise him mr gary and his 15 dancers who range in age from 10 to 25 walked gracefully onto the stage the female dancers wore brightly colored dresses the male dancers white shirts dark pants and vests the subdued opening gave way in minutes to jubilation as the dancers swirled about the stage leaping and turning with their arms outstretched in gestures of worship there are some elements of ballet and modern dance in the piece mr gary said later but basically it 's jump and shout old time foot stomping religion there 's nothing like it mr o'neil 33 also sees a power in liturgical dance he started stepping as a graduate student at pennsylvania state university and gravitated to the secular variety that was popular on campus now he teaches a more religious form to his students when he started teaching at school 231 in 1993 he said i saw the crises for the kids the temptations of the street and the lack of direction a year later he formed a stepping group nubian gents as a way to promote discipline and self respect among the students today that group tours africa asia and europe if these kids had n't joined that team a lot of them would be in gangs he said a half hour into the rehearsal mr o'neil asked his young charges need a break they sank to the floor in exhaustion gospelfest rules stipulate that routines can only last three minutes it was going to take a lot more rehearsing to get theirs down to that i do n't mind the work said one team member jeffrey princivil it helps keep all the negativity around me out of my life mcdonald 's gospelfest hammerstein ballroom 311 west 34th street today at 4
