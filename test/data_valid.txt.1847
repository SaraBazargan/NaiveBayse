now that investors realize that their interests do not always come first with their mutual fund managers perhaps they will focus on the sky high fees they have been forking over for years it has not been easy for investors to fathom exactly what they are paying in fund fees in fund prospectuses the fees charged to investors are stated as a percentage of assets at around 1 percent a year these costs look positively benign in dollar terms however the fees are staggering and when the managers receiving them turn in a woeful performance as has been the case recently more often than not the fees represent an enormous and troubling transfer of wealth from hard working individuals to some seriously fat cats so how much did investors pay to stock and bond fund managers in the most recent 12 months more than 352 billion according to max rottersman president of fundexpensescom a research firm that analyzes fund costs for institutional clients that represents 086 percent of assets in these funds if nothing else this mount everest of money makes it even more amazing that some fund managers decided to chisel and the total does not include sales charges on broker sold funds mr rottersman breaks the fees into four groups the largest is adviser fees which totaled 21 billion or 052 percent of assets other fees including the self serving 12b 1 charges fund companies use to attract new money totaled 92 billion or 023 percent of assets shareholder servicing fees added 56 billion or 014 percent and custodian fees brought in 537 million or 001 percent so apart from being a ridiculous sum to pay for subpar performance and chicanery what is 352 billion it is roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product of ecuador it is 3 billion more than what american consumers spent on major household appliances last year what else does 352 billion buy it would pay for the nation 's entire food stamp program this year as well as all the child nutrition programs run by the government the numbers at specific funds are equally astounding over the three fiscal years ending in march 2003 for example investors in the fidelity magellan fund which has not been implicated in any scandals have paid management fees of 16 billion yet in each of those years the fund lost money it was down 24 percent in fiscal 2001 and it lost 076 percent in 2002 and almost 25 percent in 2003 the stock market has recovered since march when the fund 's fiscal year ends and it is now up 18 percent for the year to date over 10 years magellan investors have paid 4 billion in management fees mr rottersman said yet the fund has lagged behind the standard poor 's 500 stock index through that period this is not to say that astute fund managers should not be allowed to make a profit but managers should be ashamed to get so very rich while their shareholders are getting poorer in a recent speech john c bogle the founder of vanguard said fund managers quest for higher profits must bear heavy responsibility for the illegal late trading and market timing where traders capitalize on time zone differences that investigators have unearthed fund shareholders must stop this wealth transfer they should demand that their employers negotiate hard for lower costs in their 401 k plans and in accounts they have more control over investors should dump low performing high cost funds now the public needs to understand the enormity of these numbers mr rottersman said when you 're paying all this money to mutual fund companies you 're working for them they 're not working for you amen
