he came wearing a smile not a grimace he shook hands and laughed and engaged the knicks players in conversation of course he spoke with coach don chaney but not about the team 's struggles james l dolan the chairman of madison square garden said he was joining the knicks on the first two games of this week 's three game texas trip to promote a family atmosphere throughout the organization not to snoop around and evaluate whether he should keep the coach and his roster intact dolan 's claim of innocence seems hard to believe considering that the knicks who fell to 14 19 after tonight 's 90 79 loss to the powerful spurs at the alamodome have shown few signs that they will make the playoffs and that chaney has yet to win consecutive games after a month at the helm but dolan is sticking to his assertion saying that his first road trip with the team has little to do with basketball i do n't have any basketball skills he said this morning i do n't know the game like the experts know the game but the point of view is that i 'm the employer i should n't be an unknown we want everyone who works for us to know that it is a family company and we 're the people you work for we 're the employers we 're not just a signature on the bottom of a check we 're not a nameless faceless soul less corporation dolan the son of cablevision 's chairman charles f dolan has taken a more active role with the knicks and the garden since dave checketts the former president of the garden resigned last may james dolan said that he planned this trip in september before the season and the knicks slide began and that he would accompany the rangers on a similar trip steve mills the garden 's president of team operations and scott layden the knicks president and general manager are also on the trip while the timing may be coincidental the presence of the knicks brain trust has caused speculation that chaney 's job might be in jeopardy dolan who will fly to houston for tuesday 's game against the rockets before leaving scoffed at the notion that he was looking over the shoulder of the 6 foot 4 chaney he 's too big to do that dolan said with a laugh i have no credentials in basketball dolan said he left all of the basketball decisions to layden and mills do you think i need to say to any of those guys point out to them what their record is dolan said they know what they 're doing they know better than i do what do i say to them i say to them 'what do you need what can i do to help tell me how i can be supportive and i 'll tell you what resources we have and what we can do with them but dolan said it was important to cablevision 's bottom line for the knicks who have the highest payroll in the eastern conference to make the playoffs the wiz the consumer electronics chain owned by cablevision lost 50 million last year he said the team is part of the garden dolan said and the garden is part of the overall company and there 's a strategy that involves the garden radio city all of our assets together in terms of how we serve new yorkers with product this is a big piece of the product so sure it 's important for the fans to be excited about the team and that means a winning team but those are no surprises to anybody here is this a playoff team ask the coach as he did in december layden refused to say that chaney who is 4 10 since taking over when jeff van gundy unexpectedly resigned would be the club 's coach for the rest of the season we still have a lot of confidence in this team and a lot of confidence in the coach and coaching staff layden said that has n't changed with the feb 21 trade deadline approaching the knicks have rekindled their longtime interest in point guard gary payton whom seattle is now willing to trade also portland is shopping its star forward rasheed wallace and point guard damon stoudamire latrell sprewell covets a big man like wallace but he might have to be a part of any deal for wallace a blockbuster deal with either team remains unlikely but layden said the knicks were exploring all possible moves we 're always looking to improve our team if we can he said but that 's not to say that we do n't like the team we have and that we do n't have confidence in our team sprewell said he did not think dolan 's presence meant that a trade or firing was imminent actually he was pretty cool on the plane he said of dolan he had interaction with guys talked to us and was real friendly that was more surprising than anything allan houston said i do n't think your owner gets on a flight just to read personalities and say 'we 've got to get rid of this guy i think he just wants to get everybody on the same page
