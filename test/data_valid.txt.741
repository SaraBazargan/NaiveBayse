before bob pettit came along there were three positions in basketball guard forward and center but pettit was so unusual that he created a fourth able to rebound like a center yet shoot with touch from the outside pettit is regarded by many as the game 's first power forward for those who never saw him play think karl malone pettit does in many ways karl malone and i had similar styles pettit said my strength was rebounding offensive and defensive shooting 18  to 20 foot jump shots going to the basket and shooting a lot of free throws pettit a hall of famer could do it all and in 1996 he was chosen as one of the nba 's 50 greatest players he led the st louis hawks to the nba championship in 1958 and in the sixth and final game pettit finished with 50 points to topple bill russell and the boston celtics he scored 19 of the hawks last 21 points that was the best game i ever played said pettit who now lives in new orleans especially because of what it meant in today 's nba such exploits would have afforded pettit financial security but that was a different time shortly after winning the title pettit returned to his hometown baton rouge la to work for his family 's real estate business an 11 time all star and two time most valuable player pettit worked every off season of his career the final three in the banking business which is how he spent most of his life after basketball despite still being near the top of his game pettit retired in 1965 in those days every player knew he had to do something after basketball he said you did n't make enough money to retire and not work that 's why i was anxious to get involved in banking i never wanted to coach once i quit basketball i shut the door and never looked back pettit 71 still has a sporting side though an avid hunter he has been to argentina to hunt doves and to mexico to hunt quail he also has a passion for golf but pettit 's love is working in finance about 15 years ago he joined three partners in establishing equitas capital advisors a financial consulting concern in new orleans it 's a wonderful business said pettit who with his wife of 38 years carole has three children and three grandchildren i 've thoroughly enjoyed it honestly even if i made all of the money they make today playing in the nba i do n't think i 'd do anything differently
