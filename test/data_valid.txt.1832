one of chad pennington 's best attributes is his intelligence right now it may also be his greatest limitation after a three day minicamp that was intended to be an immersion program for pennington while vinny testaverde recovered from foot surgery the reviews of pennington 's performance at quarterback were decidedly mixed during a news conference in which he praised several undrafted free agents and players who were trying out for the jets coach herman edwards was muted today in his assessment of pennington who took the snaps with the first team offense at times he made some nice throws edwards said and at times he 's too analytical edwards 's prescription for pennington is to just throw it pennington the 18th pick over all in the 2000 nfl draft is the son of a coach and edwards seems to believe that his thoughtful approach to the game is limiting his progress edwards made nearly identical comments about pennington last year but the spotlight is increasingly on pennington it is widely believed that the jets hope pennington 25 will be able to take over the starting job from testaverde for the 2003 season and so edwards 's comments today were particularly interesting especially because pennington seemed pleased with his progress it 's not even close the progress this year to last year pennington said i feel i 'm leaps and bounds ahead of where i was last year being more comfortable and decisive and taking charge of the offense the biggest area i 'm pleased with is being decisive there 's no hesitancy last year you could tell i was trying to be too perfect now i 'm playing backyard ball pennington noted later that he still had to be more consistent in his decision making and that he remained a bit hesitant on some plays but the jets are expecting him to make a big leap this year because he will be working with the same offense and the same coordinator for the second straight season during minicamp pennington did seem to be throwing crisper passes but edwards compared pennington 's controlled style and the bombs away approach of the third string quarterback tory woodbury who worked as a wide receiver last season woodbury did not complete many passes but he showed a fearlessness that edwards liked tory does n't know enough at quarterback at this point so every time he goes back he tries to throw it as far as he can edwards said sometimes he 's throwing rifle shots over the batting cage when he does n't see it he just takes off the problem with chad is he 's been a quarterback all his life he 's so analytical just drop back and throw the guy the ball if he throws it 10 feet over the guy 's head who cares he does n't want to make a mistake he worries about making a mistake rather than 'i 'm going to make a play edwards cited one play in which pennington showed a glimmer of what the coaches would like to see he completed a pass down the center of the field and edwards said he thought build on that the jets hope he will when the team reconvenes for 12 full squad practices in may and june edwards praised pennington 's knowledge of the offense and noted that at times he told the running backs where they were supposed to line up but then the coaches want instinct to take over edwards said testaverde had the same analytical approach but testaverde even at 38 has an extraordinarily powerful arm so that even if he makes the wrong read he can still get the ball to a spot where other quarterbacks can not and if this is who pennington is then he 'll probably never be great edwards said but that does n't mean he ca n't be a good quarterback i always tell players 'do n't play to be good play to be great that will be his problem all the great ones you 've ever seen play they 've got a swagger they do n't go by the numbers he 's got to figure out what he is he 's got a lot of attributes he 's a conscientious guy he 's got the makings of it but then he 's got to do it extra points receiver wayne chrebet was restricted during the camp because he was recovering from previously undisclosed arthroscopic surgery in march on his left shoulder which he injured last season coach herman edwards said he was not concerned about the three substance abuse suspensions that defensive tackle larry webster had served he has n't had any problems in the last two years edwards said of webster who is expected to sign a one year contract monday he knows he 's made some mistakes the jets owner robert wood johnson iv said the team still hoped to build a privately financed stadium on the west side of manhattan in time for the 2009 season
