i must confess that i was skeptical two decades ago when i started monitoring a stock market timing model that looked too good to be true according to that model beating the market was as simple as being invested in stocks on the days when the market has historically gone up the most and remaining in cash at all other times but apparently i am wrong that model the seasonality trading system from the institute for econometric research of deerfield beach fla has outperformed every other timing model monitored by the hulbert financial digest over two decades the model calls for investors to be invested in stocks only on distinct occasions each year around the turns of each month as well as just before and after exchange holidays on average that would be a total of about 90 market trading days a year the model is relatively low risk because it is safely invested in cash much of the time in fact its returns are about half as volatile as the stock market as a whole despite its conservative bent the model has produced long term returns that are every bit as good as those of the market itself an investor who used the model switching between hypothetical shares of the wilshire 5000 index and 90 day treasury bills would have made 161 percent annualized from the beginning of 1982 through january 2001 that compares to 160 percent for simply buying and holding the wilshire 5000 stocks over this nearly 20 year period that record is impressive conservative investors would have been able to sidestep much of the market 's risk without also having to forfeit profits aggressive investors would also have benefited from this timing model by investing twice as much money as they would have otherwise for example they would have doubled the market 's return while incurring no greater risk but no one should choose a strategy on the basis of its track record alone that is because past success without some plausible explanation may be a result of luck alone fortunately in this case there is an explanation according to research conducted by prof donald b keim of the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania there are distinct calendar patterns to how stocks trade relative to their bid asked spreads it turns out that at various points during the year at the end of december for example or just before exchange holidays stocks typically trade near their bid prices but immediately after those periods they trade closer to their asked prices to the extent of its bid asked spread then the average stock rises during such periods professor keim 's findings imply that there is no way to exploit these seasonal patterns by investing directly in individual stocks because the bid asked spreads would eliminate the potential gains but that is not the case when you buy stocks indirectly through no load mutual funds and exchange traded funds whose net asset values are calculated on the basis of their component stocks last trades by investing in them during these seasonal periods you can in effect buy stocks at or near their bid prices and sell them near their asked prices and you thought only market makers could do that why should there be seasonal patterns for how stocks trade relative to their spreads many different explanations have been suggested one is that retirement plan contributions typically hit the market at the beginning of each month another factor is tax loss selling that reaches a crescendo at year end a third is short term traders propensity just before exchange holidays to cover or buy back the stocks they are short there is a downside to investing according to seasonal patterns it means frequent switching into and out of the market over the last two decades in fact the seasonality trading system has recommended an average of 16 such round trips a year so do not even consider following the strategy in a taxable account or with any investment that involves high transaction costs strategies mark hulbert is editor of the hulbert financial digest a newsletter based in annandale va his column on investment strategies appears every other week e mail strategy nytimescom
