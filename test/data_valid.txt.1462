to the editor re naming hospitals good and bad editorial nov 17 making hospital and doctor report cards accessible to patients is a desirable thing not just for patients but also to improve the quality of health care for everyone what becomes apparent is the need for comprehensive reform not incremental reform yet if a patient is aware of the quality of doctors and hospitals in his or her community but does not have the freedom to choose his or her doctor or hospital then this knowledge is useless profit driven care allows choice of plan only which is worthless comprehensive reform means universal access to quality care universal benefits the freedom to choose doctors and hospitals affordability and accountability we are all in this together with profit driven care and incremental reform we will sink with health care for all we will thrive gerald frankel md mckinney tex nov 17 2000
