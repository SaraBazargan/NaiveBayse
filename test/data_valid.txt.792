health authorities are preparing for the possible return of the sars virus this fall but with any luck they should be able to prevent a global epidemic the virus is a nasty germ that can inflict terrible harm on anyone who contracts sars but the virus is relatively hard to spread and the conditions that allowed the disease to race from nation to nation last season seem unlikely to repeat themselves sars first emerged in southern china late last year most likely by spreading from an animal source to food workers or animal handlers chinese authorities were slow to recognize the new illness and then did the world an immense disservice by trying to hide it rather than alerting other nations to a newly emerging threat before it was contained the virus had caused some 8400 probable cases of sars in 29 countries and killed more than 10 percent of its victims the case mortality rate reached above 50 percent for those over age 60 many health authorities expect at least a few new sars cases this fall or winter and possibly even a lot of cases perhaps in china where the last epidemic started monitoring in asia may not be as extensive as once hoped but the global health system stands a good chance of preventing any wide outbreaks after analyzing all the data from the last outbreaks the world health organization concluded that sars is not spread easily through the air the main route is relatively large respiratory droplets carrying the virus a few yards the disease can be contained by isolating cases early tracing and isolating their contacts and using simple preventive measures like hand washing or face masks particularly in the health care settings where much of the spreading occurs such tactics buttressed by quarantines and restricted air travel stopped the epidemic last time the united states emerged largely unscathed from the last sars epidemic with only 33 probable cases hoping to keep it that way the centers for disease control and prevention has issued guidelines suggesting a very aggressive response to any outbreak the guidelines call for quarantining the family members and other close contacts of people believed to have sars preferably on a voluntary basis setting up separate health centers and closing schools businesses and mass transit to halt possible spread doctors and hospitals could require patients with a cough or respiratory symptoms to don surgical masks and isolate them the more draconian steps sound like overkill without a dire threat health authorities note that aggressive tactics worked last time should sars return they will presumably temper their prescriptions with a recognition of the costs of any large scale shutdown of normal activities
