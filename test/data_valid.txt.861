with the sun shining most of the streets cleared and the snowfall finally shut off it was a little easier today for people here to find the bright side of the week that buried buffalo i 've actually enjoyed it said lauren o'meara who sat outside a local cafe sipping coffee this afternoon despite temperatures in the mid 20 's i 've gone skiing twice right on the streets and rather than being worn out by days of shoveling or trudging through nearly seven feet of snow many people seemed invigorated by the ordeal i was walking home and heard a girl say 'i feel lucky to be here said joe rozler a jazz pianist who lives on the city 's upper west side i thought she 's right where else is this happening buffalo seemed at last to emerge from its icy cocoon today as workers from the city and surrounding erie county along with 170 national guard troops continued the onerous task of clearing buffalo 's biggest five day snowfall on record from the roadways of a city legendary for its winter storms from christmas eve until friday night 815 inches of snow fell at the buffalo niagara international airport according to the national weather service that broke the local record for an entire month and put the area within one good blast of its seasonal average of 935 inches four deaths were blamed on the storm three involving traffic accidents and one that occurred when a carport roof collapsed the lake effect snow machine fueled by moisture from lake erie was still churning but at a much slower pace with bands of snowfall staying well south of the city by today all driving bans had been lifted except in the city of lackawanna which borders buffalo to the south most main roads had been cleared down to the pavement though many buffalo side streets remained impassable or narrowed by snow piles if you were to come through this community right now you 'd have no idea 80 some inches have fallen the erie county executive joel a giambra said of the greater buffalo area it is really pretty amazing to see how quickly we 've recovered from what i call a temporary inconvenience buffalo schools were scheduled to open wednesday after the holiday break but district officials pushed the reopening to next monday they cited the potential dangers to students trying to navigate snow clogged side streets and sidewalks in many neighborhoods unplowed walkways forced pedestrians to walk in busy streets mr giambra and buffalo 's mayor anthony m masiello served as tour guides today for a group of state and federal officials that included gov george e pataki and new york 's two senators charles e schumer and hillary rodham clinton i 've seen some pretty good storms but nothing of this magnitude mr pataki said after visiting south buffalo and suburban cheektowaga two of the hardest hit areas mr pataki declared the region a state disaster area last week clearing the way for assistance from the national guard local officials are hoping for a similar federal designation which would help the financially struggling city and county governments meet cleanup costs that mr giambra expected to exceed 10 million we suspect that this will be the largest price tag of any cleanup in recent memory mr giambra said the city began returning to life in time for a downtown new year 's eve celebration despite the mountains of snow mr giambra said organizers expected a record crowd for this year 's festival during which the olympic flame was to pass through en route to salt lake city for the winter games in february a lake effect snow storm in western new york is as predictable as christmas mr giambra said it 's not nearly as problematic as communities that have to dig out from a mudslide or a flood or an earthquake and i 've never seen anyone make a snow angel in the mud
