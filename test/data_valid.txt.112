all of a sudden the light at the end of the economic tunnel does n't seem to be getting any closer for much of this year analysts expected the federal reserve board 's half dozen cuts in interest rates to shift the economy out of neutral by the fourth quarter now as autumn nears medium  and long term interest rates remain prohibitively high and each day brings news of more layoffs pundits seize upon any sign of a turnaround such as last month 's growth in new home construction clearly however companies are finding few reasons to increase their investments one obvious problem is that the fed and the bush administration are working at cross purposes the fed has been steadily lowering the federal funds rate the rate at which banks lend reserves to each other on a day to day basis with the hope that other lending rates will follow suit since january short term rates have fallen by almost three percentage points a drop in inflation driven mainly by lower energy costs has given the fed room to make another cut at its meeting today but rates on loans and mortgages with terms of five years and longer have barely responded one cause of the stickiness in long term rates is the widespread belief that the economy will resume its productivity driven boom in the next few years another cause is more troubling uncertainty about the federal government 's finances corporate tax revenues have slackened and declining business confidence suggests slim prospects for an uptick anytime soon forthcoming estimates from the white house and the congressional budget office will almost definitely show drops in the projected budget surpluses president bush has already hamstrung the coming years federal budgets with his tax cut and his unrealistic allowances for discretionary spending smaller surpluses will force congress to spend money that would otherwise have extended the solvency of medicare and social security congress has aggravated the problem by showing a disturbing lack of commitment to making these programs more sound given members disagreements on a prescription drug benefit for medicare chances for comprehensive reform look slim the white house favors a flawed politically unfeasible reform of social security and has dismissed the worsening budget forecasts the specter of a ballooning federal debt accompanied by high interest rates looms larger by the day investors have also signaled their worries about the american economy through the dollar 's cascading fall against the euro yen and british pound the weaker dollar hurts american companies that depend on foreign financing because of scant domestic saving upward pressure on prices and even higher interest rates could result as well at the moment robust consumer spending is keeping the economy growing if extremely slowly this lifeline is likely to disappear though when the slews of layoffs 5000 at ford motor company being the most dramatic in recent days begin to bite after consumers spending is finally overtaken by their mounting debts investment by businesses will have to drive economic growth yet thanks to congress and the white house the fed 's efforts to promote investment have yet to take hold europe and japan are sputtering too their problems will limit the positive impact the lower dollar might otherwise have on american exporters on the bright side though the dollar will offer some succor to struggling argentina whose currency is linked to ours while fighting to escape its own economic slump argentina has learned the lesson washington must now heed to promote investment for the long term the government must keep its own house in order
