on a rainy afternoon in helsingborg a coastal town in southern sweden a young couple were moving into a boklok development so new the grass had n't grown in around it yet you could tell something about their world by the capitalized names on their boxes the bonde entertainment unit the ektorp sofa the leksvik hat and coat rack the pax wardrobe sophia stringer 28 an athletic looking woman who manages a local soccer team brought up the back end of one box she and her partner had won a lottery competing with 400 people for the 30 apartments in the development priced about 25 percent below comparable apartments in the area the apartment features polished oak floors high ceilings and a loft style layout with a small living room pushed against an open kitchen the closets are deep the rooms small bright new ikea fixtures natural beech cabinets in the kitchen closet organizers in the bedroom added just a dollop of conspicuous design a modernist scandinavian take on the generic and ready made boklok represents the new frontier of ikea 's design ambition instead of just selling furnishings the company is trying something much bolder actually building homes groups of homes in fact housing developments built according to the same principles that guide the design of ikea furniture the homes are small modernist units prefabricated and mass produced to minimize the price and organized to maximize interaction among residents i do n't think we 're creating communities said joakim blomquist one of the five members of the boklok team measuring his words it 's up to people to create their own but this is not only housing this is very consequent said alexander von vegesack director of the vitra design museum in weil am rhein germany if you do the entire living environment then of course you should end up thinking of cheap well designed houses as well i do n't know if it really will happen on the same scale that they are developing furniture but what i saw in the south of sweden was very positive it was a new way of housing that looked interesting and was functional and it was very light with natural materials very appealing for human use the scale of the houses and the way they are arranged are largely a response to the high scandinavian divorce rate the big houses of the 20th century did n't fit the micro families of the 21st madeleine nobs one of the architects saw the project in an overtly missionary cast so many architects are making houses for their own way of how they want to live she said we started with research not just making beautiful drawings like a typical boklok resident nobs is a single mother with two children to her one of the big problems for such singles is isolation with an ikea faith in design solutions the architects tried to fix this problem they constructed the buildings in an l shape nobs said to force greater contact among building residents and dug a small communal garden in front so neighbors would be joined in a small project better living through geometry the boklok idea is that you have to be close to your neighbors and have dialogue that means so much to cut costs the company expects the residents to manage the development cooperatively taking two year turns on a governing board the boards can be instruments in what the writer roland huntford calls benign swedish totalitarianism when one woman in helsingborg wanted to build a wall behind her apartment to keep the wind off her patio the board turned her down saying that the units had to be uniform other neighbors who wanted to put up satellite dishes to watch foreign television were similarly rejected in some developments everybody gathers twice a year for a huge cleanup and repair of the grounds neighbors in each unit take turns tending the grass and hedges the equivalent of the do it yourself assembly at ikea we meet all six together and have coffee and discuss lawn work said therese henriksson 32 who shares a ground floor apartment with her 2 year old daughter maja so you know you get that piece of paper in your mailbox every six weeks yippee it 's my turn to cut the lawn ikea is not the only design company trying to extend its reach to cover the whole domicile michael graves is developing a prefab house for target in 1999 philippe starck and a partner john hitchcox started a company called yoo to build high end homes that reflect starck 's design from the layout to the lemon squeezer in the kitchen customers choose one of four design palettes classic minimal nature and culture each corresponding to a lexicon of portentous and expensive attributes the first american venture with condos selling from 330000 to more than 1 million is in motion for south beach in miami blomquist says that there are no plans to build boklok housing in the united states where higher land prices might dilute the cost cutting measures but the project has expanded into norway and finland the company is close to a decision to start in denmark and is researching the feasibility of boklok england and in sweden there are currently more than 1000 boklok units the problem with trying to conceive ideal housing even on a small scale is one of overweening ambition said ruth eaton an architectural historian and the author of ideal cities utopianism and the un built environment you build little pockets of them and a lot of them work quite well she said the idea of building an ideal little street is quite laudable but you ca n't put the same thing everywhere that 's where utopias go wrong they say 'i 've worked out the perfect solution this is applicable anywhere you ca n't take over the world because conditions are too different calling for different solutions yes for stockholm no for timbuktu john leland the world of ikea john leland is a style reporter for the times
