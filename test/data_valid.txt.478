on the field there was nothing that could be construed as divine intervention on behalf of the mets gone were the pitching and hitting that carried them to four straight victories and the improbable contributions from almost every corner of the locker room without them it was hard to find anything magical happening yesterday at shea stadium where the mets lost to the florida marlins 5 1 pummeled by their own miscues and three florida home runs the mets flat performance put a damper on a 9 4 homestand that helped them crawl back from a 13 1 2 game deficit in the national league east standing on aug 18 to just seven and a half games coming into this game the loss dropped them eight and a half games behind the braves and now the mets are off to philadelphia singing a familiar refrain we 've got to win a lot of games mets pitcher glendon rusch said tight ballgames like today are the ones we need to pull out if we can do that it 's going to be interesting jay payton was more direct we ca n't afford to lose period he said we need to win every single game a difficult task particularly for a team that is lingering seven games below 500 at 65 72 and has dangerous defensive lapses rusch 6 10 sustained most of the damage surrendering four runs in seven innings despite throwing better than he has in recent weeks rusch has not won since july 25 when he beat the marlins in seven starts since rusch has four losses with three no decisions the mets have lost all seven games rusch 's problems came early as luis castillo led off the game with a line drive triple that payton lost in the sun by the time he spotted the ball it was sailing over his head alex gonzalez grounded out scoring castillo for a 1 0 lead i did n't see it payton said then when i saw it it was too late because it was a rocket ball that 's the worst time of day desi relaford tied the score in the bottom of the first inning driving an 0 1 pitch into the right field bullpen but the marlins took a 2 1 lead in the top of the fifth inning when derrek lee led off with an opposite field single moved to second on a sacrifice bunt by pitcher ryan dempster and scored on a two out single to left by castillo tsuyoshi shinjo rushed the throw home the ball bounding up the first base line that allowed lee to score when mike piazza 's attempt to lunge catch the ball and slap on the tag proved unsuccessful the mets squandered many early chances when todd zeile led off the second inning with a double payton failed to move him over grounding to third after a walk to rey ordonez rusch 's attempt to bunt the runners over failed when he popped out dempster 15 11 then got matt lawton on a pop to second ending the threat in the fourth robin ventura led off with a single and when valentine tried to hit and run zeile struck out and ventura was thrown out at second dempster then settled down and retired 11 straight batters rusch contributed to his downfall by giving up a solo home run to preston wilson in the sixth inning two batters later kevin millar hit another solo homer for a 4 1 lead wilson the former mets farmhand added another solo home run in the eighth inning off tom martin marking the second time this season that he has delivered two home runs in one game against the mets the home runs basically took us out of the game rusch said when you 're in a game that tight you ca n't let that happen i was trying to do what i could to keep us close after preston 's homer it was 3 1 and we were still in the game at that point we were still in it at 4 1 but it 's just been frustrating for me inside pitch after the game mets general manager steve phillips announced that the team had acquired c j nitkowski the former st john 's university left hander and cash in a deal with the detroit tigers for a player to be named later nitkowski appeared in 56 games with the tigers this season before being sent to the team 's class aaa affiliate toledo on aug 22 where he appeared in one game he will join the team in mets and could be available to play this afternoon benny agbayani who fractured the hamate bone in his right hand on saturday will have a bone scan tuesday and very likely will have season ending surgery on friday timo perez rejoined the team yesterday having been recalled from norfolk the mets class aaa affiliate to replace agbayani perez who was demoted on july 16 hit 359 for the tides he was a pinch hitter in the eighth inning and grounded to first
