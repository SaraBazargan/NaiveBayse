observers of rutgers football are used to seeing the team lose after all its last winning season was more than a decade ago in 1992 and under its current coach the team has only 3 victories to match its 20 losses but losing two quality rivals in the big east conference virginia tech and the university of miami to the atlantic coast conference beginning with the 2003 2004 season did not make rutgers officials any happier even if winning might become easier indeed the loss of the big east 's two top teams leaves rutgers with more questions than answers one urgent concern regards recruiting quality players to a conference with an uncertain future for now rutgers and a handful of other big east schools are suing miami and the ac asserting that their defections could cause the remaining six universities to lose up to 165 million in royalties annually moreover the conference could lose its rights to a coveted bowl game which brings money and national exposure then there are those a collection of university professors and alumni who see a silver lining rather than a cloud in all of this for years they have sought to push the scarlet knights out of the big east and into a conference that offers fewer athletic scholarships to them such a move would solidify the university 's commitment to academics rather athletic prowess this is the right moment said rudolph m bell an english professor at rutgers are rutgers 1600 athletes getting a good education or are they taking the place of 1600 other students who would perform better than them these are questions we should be asking one another but university administrators insist they are devoted to sculpting a powerhouse football program at the division i a level the top tier in competitive collegiate athletics it may be a while before a direction emerges said richard l mccormick the new president of rutgers as recently as last wednesday officials from several big east schools met at newark liberty international airport to discuss the future of the conference though no plans were disclosed the big east will regroup and eventually be better for it said gregory schiano head football coach at rutgers for now several potential additions to the big east roster have surfaced including the university of cincinnati xavier university and the university of memphis right now anybody recruited to rutgers or any big east school has no idea what the league is composed of or whether it has automatic rights to bowl games mr bell said but you have to realize that rutgers has had major recruiting problems the fact is rutgers football has been in a huge slump since the 1990 's the team has gone through three head coaches and has lost more games than it has won since 1994 when it had five wins five losses and a tie and now the university has lost one of its top selling points the chance to play against two of the best teams in the nation there 's no question that that uncertainty could be hurtful in the minds of some student athletes or their coaches who are giving them advice mr mccormack said but we 'll proceed to do what 's best for our conference i 'm not terribly worried one recent victory was a verbal commitment from mike teal who is entering his senior year at don bosco prep in wyckoff it almost changed my mind and made me think about the whole situation said mr teel who as quarterback led his team to a ranking of eighth in the nation last year but rutgers dedication to division i a clinched the deal it 's always been my dream to play division i football he said in 1991 rutgers university voted to have its football team join the big east making the scarlet knights one of more than 100 ncaa schools that compete in division i a which allows for the most scholarships for instance rutgers the only 1 a team in new jersey currently has 85 football scholarships to dole out if the school dropped to division i aa the number of scholarships would dwindle to 63 so the debate grinds on some professors at rutgers say moving all university athletics to a different division will allow more money to go to research and academics what you want are students on your football team said william dowling an english professor we want a situation in which students go to class and if they 're talented enough they go out for the team mr dowling has even begun a campaign to move rutgers into the patriot league 's division i aa which does not offer football scholarships where it would play football against schools like bucknell and georgetown several university professors plan meet in september to discuss rutgers athletic future dr mccormick said he was aware of the meeting though i can not provide any particular encouragement that those who want rutgers to leave the big east will be satisfied mr bell who is planning the discussion was disheartened by the administrative response the fact that the decision is done he said that would be most unfortunate
