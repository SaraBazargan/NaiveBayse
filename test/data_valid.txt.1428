in any given high school you 've got your smart students your rich students and your egocentrically manipulative students they 're often different animals the rich ones are not necessarily the smart ones the smart ones can also be the most altruistic once in a while though you hit the evil trifecta a student who is rich smart and selfishly machiavellian such a student is at the core of criminal acts an intriguing play by kim merrill now getting its premiere at playwrights theater of new jersey the student played by derek richardson goes by the name of topper and as senior year is coming to a close he has talked two weaker willed friends into attacking a teacher the attack goes awry and the worlds of the various characters begin to come apart ms merrill a new york writer whose plays have been produced at an assortment of theaters in the city and elsewhere draws from this starting point a taut study of friendship and guilt and justice she smartly begins the play just after the crime has been committed letting the details of what happened emerge gradually fueling the tension the assault was prompted by a bad grade that the teacher patrick brinker gave to topper 's friend moot john mccarthy and it was simply intended to scare the victim but moot panicked during the attack and shot the teacher injuring him to make matters worse moot thinks the teacher identified him the play opens with moot and the third student topper 's girlfriend crane tina frantz distraught and wondering if they should flee but topper full of the cockiness of the privileged remains calm it is a measure of his arrogance that he has just come from visiting the teacher in the hospital in act i ms merrill uses the classic rogue 's triangle to fairly good effect the three young criminals take turns swapping blame and accusations and their partnership is almost undone the actors look too old for their parts it would be interesting to see the play staged with actual students in the roles but they catch their types well in this they get an assist from hollywood ms frantz looks eerily like the actress katie holmes who starred in a 1999 film teaching mrs tingle that also involved three students who attack a teacher and mr richardson somehow manages to invoke both jude law and matt damon the rich kid and his fake friend from the creepy 1999 film the talented mr ripley criminal acts which is performed without intermission has its best moments in act ii when moot overcome with guilt goes to visit the teacher and his wife sarah knapp for a lively 20 minutes ms merrill achieves the almost impossible mixing in some great humor while not losing the dramatic tension the story loses some steam at the end largely because of the structure ms merrill has chosen the source of everyone 's troubles topper disappears after act i and is not seen again so the big confrontation scene ends up being between moot and the teacher this may be to underscore one of ms merrill 's main points that rich kids like topper rarely have to face the consequences of their actions but still it leaves things feeling a bit unfulfilled the biggest problem criminal acts faces though is finding the right audience the play seems a bit too young for staid theatergoers but a bit too old for the 20 and under crowd there is plenty here for both groups however maybe this will be the play that finds the happy medium criminal acts playwrights theater of new jersey 33 green village road madison through feb 18 today and next sunday at 3 pm thursday and friday at 8 pm and saturday at 2 and 8 pm 973 514 1787
