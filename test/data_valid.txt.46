when casting donizetti 's opera maria stuarda it 's ideal to find two sopranos of different vocal styles and temperaments to portray the two british queens whose rivalry dominates the story the title character mary stuart queen of scots and elisabetta queen elizabeth i the conductor eve queler accomplished this and then some with the performance she conducted on sunday night at carnegie hall with the opera orchestra of new york ruth ann swenson sang maria and lauren flanigan sang elisabetta both are great sopranos but in totally different ways the performance was a testimony to the stylistic and interpretive variety that is possible in bel canto opera ms swenson was in sumptuous voice she may lack some degree of intensity but for sheer beauty of sound and purity of tone she can not be topped from her first entrance when the imprisoned queen sings a wistful cavatina about freedom ms swenson 's singing was ravishingly tender lyrically pliant and luscious she could render a service to opera by going from conservatory to conservatory and letting young singers clasp their hands about her diaphragm as she sings for a demonstration of perfect breath support as always ms swenson 's sound especially in her floated sustained high range singing resonated throughout the hall without a trace of effort as elisabetta ms flanigan wore the visceral effort of singing as a badge of honor true to form she was a fierce impassioned life force tearing through the coloratura passagework leaping to high notes with hellbent determination making pretty sounds was not her intention and some of her singing was rough and wobbly yet there was a different kind of beauty earthy and raw in her work ms queler was content to stay out of the way and simply provide a supportive orchestral backdrop for her two prima donnas the tenor gregory kunde made a vocally reliable and earnest leicester the hapless man in the middle of the regal showdown the sturdy bass baritone patrick carfizzi was talbot the warm voiced mezzo soprano eleni matas was maria 's nurse anna and the promising baritone chang yong liao made his opera orchestra debut as elisabetta 's scheming lord cecil the program contained an insert with personal tributes from numerous musicians to henry schuman the orchestra 's longtime principal oboist who played in the rehearsals on monday and tuesday of last week then died of a heart attack last wednesday
