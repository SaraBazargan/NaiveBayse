jim boeheim paced the syracuse locker room exactly as he had done after each game for the past 27 seasons giving his team his impressions of the preceding 40 minutes of basketball early this morning however there was a crucial difference the 58 year old boeheim was smiling ear to ear thanking walk ons and stars managers and assistants alike the orangemen had defeated kansas 81 78 to capture their first national title surpassing milestones in their six game run through the tournament they became only the third no 3 seeded team to capture the national championship and the first since michigan in 1989 they became the first team since villanova in 1985 to begin the season unranked in the preseason associated press poll to cut down the nets two sensational freshmen point guard gerry mcnamara and forward carmelo anthony lived up to their billings mcnamara made six 3 pointers in the first half as the orangemen scored a championship record 53 points anthony finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds but boeheim wanted to impress upon his players and staff that they had won as a team and singled out neither mcnamara nor anthony but the reserve guard josh pace as the orangemen 's most valuable player of the tournament against oklahoma state in the second round pace a 6 foot 5 sophomore grabbed eight rebounds and made three steals to help syracuse erase a 17 point deficit he scored 14 points against auburn in the round of 16 when the jayhawks mounted a second half rally to whittle syracuse 's lead from 11 to 5 and then to 3 points pace beat them back with 7 rebounds and 6 points while mcnamara did not score in the second half and anthony had only 7 points their less celebrated teammates did their jobs craig forth a 7 0 sophomore center planted himself in the middle to block two shots and rattled home a dunk with 3 minutes 8 seconds left to stop a 6 0 kansas run and stretch syracuse 's lead to 78 70 guard billy edelin a freshman backup went 4 of 6 from the foul line down the stretch and finally there was the sophomore forward hakim warrick lunging out of nowhere to block what looked to be a wide open 3 point attempt by michael lee that would have tied the score with 17 seconds left josh pace was just unbelievable on the backboards and then just making plays on the offensive end boeheim said all year long we 've had different guys when we face adversity you think freshmen would have a problem as well as we played for kansas to get right back in it the second half to be at 3 you would think any group of young players would just go 'well we made every shot we 're only 3 points ahead they do n't think that way a kansas team that was thought to be faster wiser and better coached proved to be none of those the jayhawks fast break never got in gear because boeheim and his staff decided to drop their guards back on defense on every shot whether syracuse made or missed and rather than defend the middle of the floor the guards drifted to the wings to deny easy outlet passes the strategy held kansas to only 13 points off the break and forced enough errant passes to lead to 18 turnovers the jayhawks all americans nick collison and kirk hinrich both seniors were rattled from the opening tip despite 21 rebounds and 19 points collison stalled kansas 's comeback attempt by making only 1 of 7 free throws in the second half contributing mightily to the jayhawks atrocious foul shooting 12 of 30 and hinrich who started the game with an air ball was 6 of 20 from the field and appeared reluctant to shoot in the final minutes this was roy williams 's fourth trip to the final four and the ever emotional and tightly wound williams was predictably devastated after the loss all week he had refused to answer questions about returning to his alma mater north carolina and replace matt doherty his former assistant he said he did not want speculation about his leaving kansas to be a distraction but perhaps ultimately it was williams responded with a profanity on national television when he was asked repeatedly by a cbs reporter moments after the game whether he was staying at kansas no matter if williams is in lawrence or chapel hill he now supplants boeheim as the coach with the most ncaa tournament victories without a national title boeheim has spent most of his career being dissected and second guessed because of his lack of a championship no more for the entire season he believed in his young team even though anthony his charismatic star confessed that he was not entirely sure about the orangemen 's title hopes i thought we were one year away this year to be honest with you said anthony who is most likely off to the nba i was telling billy edelin all year long that we was going to go to the final four people around me the students were looking at me like i was crazy but we did it even better as boeheim reminded them in a jubilant locker room they did it together
