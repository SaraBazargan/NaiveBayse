pat riley bill parcells dean smith lou holtz mike shanahan don shula john calipari and joe torre have done it so has rick pitino and it 's time he stopped it 's time that he stopped writing books that tell readers that they can improve their businesses by following the way he leads basketball players unless you want your company to resemble the 12 22 celtics pitino vowed to remake the celtics in his successful up tempo hustling image when he became their president and head coach in 1997 but he could not and he resigned yesterday leaving behind 25 million of the 485 million he would have received had he stayed through 2007 even if you sympathize with pitino 's having had underachieving players rejecting his leadership you wonder how he squares his extreme reaction to failure in boston with the advice he dispensed in lead to succeed broadway books which came out last may after the celtics finished 35 47 in the 1999 2000 season we can not let ourselves get ground down by failure he counseled we must totally believe and be very positive about the future he added i refuse to succumb to failure and no leader has it easy all the time and but you ca n't let failure get you down but nowhere is rick 's no 1 rule of resignation described lead to succeed was preceded by his 1997 book success is a choice which employed tales about coaching patrick ewing mark jackson or antoine walker to help readers maybe the middle manager in a plastics factory or a human resources executive at a nonprofit foundation achieve his or her goals if books like pitino 's were marketed simply as sports books they would be well targeted but these books ignore the vast chasm of differences between sports and the real world where real people make five figure salaries do n't have agents finding them work do n't see themselves in highlights on espn and can not often engage in antisocial behavior without being fired will a bank teller 's failure to advance to loan officer be illuminated by pitino 's stories about how he nearly fouled up his relationship with bill cartwright who had called in sick to a shoot around with the knicks or how he found a money manager for jamal mashburn and if you 're a high level corporate officer with a 750000 salary and stock options would you want rick pitino telling you how to do better would n't you listen to jack welch or warren buffett first pitino 's first book came out weeks before he joined the celtics after coaching the university of kentucky wildcats to a 219 50 record and one national championship perfect timing joe torre waited to write joe torre 's ground rules for winners until the yankees won the 1996 and 1998 world series his record as a manager with the mets braves and cardinals had not aligned him with the publishing stars i can see pitino motivating himself to write a follow up to volume 1 to move on to defining leadership after all was n't he the former wunderkind now maturing into an auerbach for a new millennium surely pitino believed he could revive the celtics surely he could do better than m l carr who coached before him that confidence and his track record secured his place as a corporate speaker and demand for lead to succeed similar timing befell bill parcells 's volume finding a way to win which came out during his new england patriots 6 10 season in 1995 but advice and reality do n't always mesh perfectly by last november pitino should have been rereading volume 2 come january he said when his team 's record was 4 6 if we do n't start playing better defense and do n't start executing better even though we all enjoy each other it 's a tight knit group i told them 'you 'll have a new coach next year a month later he offered this musing on his accountability rather than blow the team up all the time i 've got to blow up myself the doubting or imploding pitino does not appear in lead to succeed he writes about his woes with the young celtics and admits to a smidgen of self doubt but only as they helped stiffen his resolve during the 1998 99 lockout season pitino 's second with the celtics he and the team struggled after improving by 21 victories the season before i also was n't used to sensing that the people around me were feeling sorry for me he wrote so i had to do some soul searching too and you know what i discovered i had to stay focused on my vision for the team what i came away with was a stronger belief in my coaching philosophy no talk of quitting struggle was a life lesson that he could sell to himself and his readers it 's not a recipe for blowing oneself up and leaving the team in midseason perhaps pitino 's experiences could not anticipate how it would feel to coach a 12 22 team that was losing badly and keeping people away from the fleet center but when you write about handling adversity in one way then handle your defining crisis differently by exiting in midseason then pitino may have succumbed to the the disease of me which the eminent dr riley diagnosed in 1993 in the winner within as an overwhelming belief in one 's own importance
