this non catholic had taken a vow of silence on the church 's sexual abuse scandals only a fool he figured would step into a brawl affecting a religion not his own besides a non catholic is out of his league offering opinions on priestly celibacy or the ordination of women but the vow crumbled on the weekend it did not survive the latest words of several princes of the american church as they headed for the vatican and a showdown starting today with pope john paul ii among those summoned was cardinal edward m egan the leader of 24 million catholics in the new york archdiocese what struck these ears was how cardinal egan sounded less like a pastor than a not fully penitent politician after an embarrassing flub or perhaps an enron executive about to go before a congressional committee the cardinal had written a letter read at masses over the weekend that was supposed to be taken as an apology of sorts for any church failings that may have occurred in new york and in the diocese of bridgeport where he used to be the bishop the letter said if in hindsight we also discover that mistakes may have been made as regards prompt removal of priests and assistance to victims i am deeply sorry if you do n't need to read kipling to be reminded what a big word if can be it is a favorite of politicians after they have done something especially dumb and want to give the appearance of apologizing without actually apologizing if i offended anyone i 'm sorry how many times have you heard politicians wrap themselves in that cloak of conditionality cardinal egan did not stop there on sunday celebrating mass at a south bronx church he described the awful revelations about some catholic clergymen as a very tragic situation that too is the sort of squishy phrase favored by politicians when they find themselves in a pickle at the district attorney 's office prosecutors do n't use words like tragedy they call the sexual abuse of children a crime then there was the latest contribution from cardinal bernard f law of boston the crisis he said on sunday was a wake up call for the church it seemed odd phrasing from a man accused by angry catholics of having set his moral clock to snooze alarm finally if somewhat belatedly the light bulb clicked on this vow of silence made no sense the church 's behavior in this ordeal affects us all the archbishop of new york is a moral force for everyone in this city what he says or perhaps more accurately in this case what he does not say is as important to non catholics as it is to catholics it mattered to all new yorkers that cardinal francis spellman ardently supported the war in vietnam it mattered that cardinal john o'connor seemed to encourage voters to shun geraldine a ferraro and mario m cuomo because of their views on abortion it mattered that cardinal egan went to albany last month with a legislative agenda on reflection silence seemed wrong headed too much is on the line everybody in society has a stake in the question of what happens to children said margaret o'brien steinfels the editor of commonweal robert hoyt the founding editor of the national catholic reporter said holding people in authority to account for obvious dereliction of duty affects everybody william a donohue also saw no reason for silence mr donohue president of the catholic league for religious and civil rights is ever on the alert for anti catholic bigotry he has long maintained with some justification that anti catholicism is the last respectable bias among people who would never dare utter an offensive word about jews or blacks or gays in this scandal however mr donohue says that non catholics have every right to speak out but i would say only up to a point he added house rules like celibacy are off limits that aside he said the catholic church has a tremendous public effect on society and should be scrutinized the same as any other institution the bobbing and weaving that has marked much of the church 's response will not do mr donohue said nor does he exempt the vatican from criticism it tends toward elliptical statements responding to 21st century issues with 16th century communications skills take it from someone who covered the place for three years people want plain talk mr donohue said that 's what we need plain speakers
