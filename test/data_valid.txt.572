a couple of years ago judging by roadside signs it looked as though the rural economy of america depended almost entirely on the sale and resale of beanie babies on every country road you passed hand lettered squares of cardboard nailed to a fence or tied to a mailbox announcing the availability of beanie babies if you did n't know what beanie babies were the signs could be confusing lambs for sale at one farmstead piglets at another down the road and beanie babies at a third as i drove home from the train station the other night over nearly an hour of country roads i realized i had n't seen a beanie babies sign in a long time that sector of the rural economy has moved i think to the internet but the roadside is still a public market never mind the farm stands which are now coming into their midsummer glory what i mean is the person who builds utility trailers one by one in the garage in his spare time and then parks them beside the road with a for sale sign on the hitch or the kids who run a summer business selling small bags of camp wood by the side of the road at about 1000 a cord nearly every farm has a lot usually behind a machine shed full of old implements half buried in tall grass some are genuine antiques some are too good to be given up and some are junk but every now and then there is one that is just the right vintage a 1980 's feed wagon say to be stationed out near the ditch you do n't even have to see the for sale sign to know the wagon is for sale something about its position says it all the wagon is n't really talking to the weekenders heading upcountry it 's talking to the farmers who drive by it every day for whom the blacktop highway is still a local farm road there is a gesture in those roadside offers the short red school bus the 1100 pickup that i ca n't help admiring at first they look like pure dismissal a way of unloading disused pieces of equipment or making a little extra money on stuff that was just lying around anyway but they are really invitations they show a confidence in the passer by and in time someone will park on the shoulder and take a slow walk around that feed wagon perhaps even crawl underneath it to check the running gear maybe not soon but when it happens the doorbell will ring or the dogs will bark a stranger will present himself someone from farther up the road across the ridge down the valley the price was firm once back when the wagon was new a price anyone could understand but now the wagon belongs to a different economy which is as much a matter of tact and understanding as it is dollars and cents it 's a matter of knowing what things that have lost or long outlived their prices are really worth stranger to stranger neighbor to neighbor verlyn klinkenborg
