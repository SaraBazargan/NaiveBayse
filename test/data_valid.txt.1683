the unrestrained optimism that engulfed the jets when training camp opened two weeks ago has ebbed replaced this week by reality induced pragmatism after the first team offense and defense looked ragged in the preseason opening loss to atlanta the jets face the super bowl champion baltimore ravens on saturday night the ravens have one of the best defenses in football history with significant questions about how readily the team is adapting to new systems on both sides of the ball the jets starters will play much of the first half and that comes as a relief to quarterback vinny testaverde he played only two series last week and barely was able to warm up his arm in the 20 10 loss to the falcons spending more time handing off to curtis martin than looking downfield this week testaverde expressed concern that the offense was struggling to digest the voluminous playbook that accompanies the new west coast offense there are already 400 plays installed with more to come perhaps this is not the most opportune time to face a defense that has had to wait an extra week to finally hit an opponent the ravens first preseason game against philadelphia in veterans stadium last monday was canceled because of turf problems of course in a preseason game the jets will not unveil everything the first team offense will have at its disposal about 15 percent of those new plays coach herman edwards estimated this week has been all about simplifying the systems so that everyone can catch up edwards said he was eager to see if the jets could play smarter with fewer mistakes and less hesitancy players understand the importance of playing better than last week edwards said i think vinny is speaking for everyone you have to find out what you can do well on offense that 's every training camp in the third week everything runs together when the season starts it wo n't be of this magnitude you practice more plays than what you run in a game you have to open the envelope to see what players can do martin admitted that he felt like a rookie so overwhelming is the amount of new information he is trying to learn this feels like high school martin said but we recognize that we wo n't have 400 plays in when the season starts this is when we have to put it in in training camp and then during the season we condense i believe by the start of the season against indianapolis we 'll have it down pat if the offense wants to gauge itself against the ravens defense as wide receiver wayne chrebet said it does then the defense will use itself as a measuring stick facing atlanta 's jamal anderson last week the jets run stopping ability looked suspect with shaun ellis a former defensive end struggling at tackle and a revolving door at nose tackle trying to fill in for jason ferguson the injured starter the jets defense is still a work in progress ellis will start at tackle and maurice anderson at nose tackle the defensive coordinator ted cottrell said this would be an important game for both of them to see if a week of intensive work on how to line up had paid off and to test their confidence cottrell said he was not concerned because ellis made improvements this week in practice now cottrell 's only defensive worry is depth rick lyle will start at right end but eric ogbogu who played well last week will rotate with him there is still some discussion about giving ellis time at defensive end next week but the jets hope he will settle in at tackle i expect him to get better edwards said of ellis i do n't expect him to be warren sapp he 's going to be fine i 'm just hoping he does n't feel there 's a lot of pressure we 'll do what 's best for shaun what would be best for the jets would be a better performance than last week but edwards says he is not concerned every facet of this team is new the general manager the head coach the offense the defense the coaches edwards said the more you 're comfortable the better we 'll be extra points safety scott frost practiced for the first time after missing the first three weeks of camp because of rib and ankle injuries he was in a car accident before training camp began frost will not play saturday against baltimore but will probably be ready next week laveranues coles and aaron glenn will return punts kevin swayne and matt farmer may also get a chance j p machado will start at guard in place of randy thomas who has a groin injury curtis martin said he would miss playing against ravens defensive lineman tony siragusa a friend who is recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery
