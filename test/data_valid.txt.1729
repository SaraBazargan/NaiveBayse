americans love a parade we cheer the soldiers in their old uniforms marching down main street on memorial day and we scream with delight when bart simpson soars overhead in macy 's thanksgiving day extravaganza that 's nice but is american ready for a bevy of drag queens flipping their curls as charlie 's angels or gangs of half naked gladiators tossing severed ears into the crowd because those are a few of the tamer sights that the national television audience is likely to see on tuesday night at 7 when the greenwich village halloween parade is shown live on usa and the sci fi channel there 's a seven second broadcast delay so if things get really raunchy we can just cut to one of our man in the street interviews said bonnie hammer sci fi 's executive vice president and general manager but we 're not going to shy away from the outrageous elements of the parade we 're sci fi our whole world is about fantasy we can push the limits the greenwich village halloween parade is all about pushing the limits in the beginning it was strictly a local event an informal street party for residents of this famously independent neighborhood reflecting the area 's high concentration of artists gays political radicals and rebellious youth the parade was a raucous celebration of the village 's iconoclastic spirit the most popular costumes and parade routines were prized for their originality and audacious wit a chorus line of richard simmons tubbies exhorting the crowd to shake off the fat a demented joan crawford abusing the stuffed doll standing in for her ungrateful daughter a neighborhood family marching side by side in hand painted cardboard boxes proudly proclaiming themselves the manhattan skyline the spirit of the parade has n't really changed that much but last year about 25000 people took part in the flamboyant festivities which has long been re routed away from the narrow residential streets of the west village and directed up the broad parade ground of sixth avenue close to two million spectators turned up to watch the funky little street party has grown into a huge event and usa cable the division of usa networks that owns and operates both usa and sci fi decided that it was high time to treat the event as prime time entertainment gordon beck a senior vice president for live production at usa cable credtis steve dinkes a producer in usa 's sports department for coming up with the idea i thought he was insane said mr beck but steve convinced me that the parade truly was a special event it had evolved over the years from this stereotyped gay parade into this huge popular and singular new york event mr beck sold the parent network on the parade as a family event in the broadcast possible sense of that word the unique new york family of parents and kids and singles of all genders even cross genders that 's such a new york thing he said since the parade organizers had designated 2001 as the theme for this year 's march sci fi put in an immediate claim to manage the hybrid telecast usa can have it next year said ms hammer but this year we 're the masters the science fiction theme is absolutely perfect for us because it 's organic we 're headed into the new millennium towards 2001 so it 's a sci fi year a sci fi parade ok but will the ever eccentric paraders march to sci fi 's expectations given the science fiction theme you might expect a smart showing of out of this galaxy characters from popular sci fi shows like farscape and lexx but what 's to stop irreverent new yorkers from ignoring the futuristic theme and turning up en masse as pigtailed cheerleaders in micro mini skirts and pom poms that 's a possibility this year according to the costume shops wig makers and makeup artists who help the celebrants with their get ups anticipating the trends these savvy party people advise viewers to watch for small children waving their magic wands as harry potter group acts inspired by movies like the matrix and x men and a plethora of disgusting snake and rat scenarios from survivor this year the cute young boys all want to be jennifer lopez said maria ayala who manages patricia fields 's wig and costume shops in soho but cheerleaders and schoolgirls are also huge everybody 's really into that naughty schoolgirl look from britney spears 's new album the big boys are more apt to take their cue from the samurai movie ghost dog whose black cloaked warriors belong to a martial arts brotherhood that ms ayala compares to organized crime but in a spiritual way tony bianchi who owns halloween a shop in the east village predicts that gladiators are going to be big this year gladiators are strong and sexy an icon of the macho warrior he said and just look at the stuff they got to play with they got chest pieces and armor and skirts and helmets and do n't forget swords and battle axes although mr bianchi mourns the dearth of political scandals and eye catching homicide cases of the caliber that inspired the memorable oj simpson and clinton lewinsky enactments of previous years he has faith in the ingenuity of his fellow new yorkers these new people bush and gore are like vanilla ice cream he said but i think we 'll get some interesting versions of the al gore kiss record sites of leather masks and feather boas also promise some provocative variations on the age old fright themes association with halloween revelry the weirder the better said sci fi 's ms hammer nobody west or south of the statue of liberty has any idea what this parade is about she said the sheer outrageousness of it the absolute spontaneity this is nothing like the way they do halloween in other parts of the country ths is new york 's own thing in bringing new york 's thing to sci fi she makes no bones about wanting to bring sci fi 's thing to new york we know we have a strong fan base in new york and now we want to build on that grass roots base she said there 's an independent world of theater and film in new york that lives on creativity and sci fi thrives on that creative energy this is new york 's own version of doing halloween she said it 's a cult event that has become more main stream and more commercial in recent years but it ai n't your macy 's thanksgiving day parade
