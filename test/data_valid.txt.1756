to the editor i was surprised to see in enron is grist for business school courses business day feb 6 that there was virtually no mention of the enron scandal 's impact on business school classes in ethics i recall that when i took a required course in business ethics in the late 1980 's students had very little interest in the course some of their ethical decisions astounded me as many students were focused strictly on the bottom line even in a class that was instituted for the purpose of offering alternate criteria and guidelines for making business decisions is n't one of the lessons of enron that business schools and business students need to pay more attention to the study of business ethics ken swensen pound ridge ny feb 6 2002
