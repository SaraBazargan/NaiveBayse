to the sports editor i applaud william c rhoden in defense of players and the game aug 17 for taking up the unpopular cause criticism of the players by fans and the news media has been running rampant let 's be clear baseball is a business and was such even before ballplayers were mere chattels owned by their ball club and not allowed to work for any other team until free agency in a free enterprise system people and players have the right to maximize earnings and especially as rhoden says in a short uncertain life span as in their sport he added when owners are no longer willing to pay they wo n't perhaps since free agency the tail is now wagging the dog is derek jeter worth the money not the issue are he and his brethren asking for more no they want to keep the status quo keep the right to earn what a free market allows could continued salary escalation be a train wreck waiting to happen very possibly do players have a right to tell owners how much revenue and taxes the clubs should share probably not but do the players have a right to strike absolutely just like the rest of us regardless of how much the earnings are stan newman new york
