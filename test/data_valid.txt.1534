it 's hard while reading martin amis 's koba the dread a quirky yet cogent indictment of stalin and lenin for fathomless crimes against humanity to contemplate celebrations of soviet history even those perhaps intended ironically shostakovich 's symphony no 11 the year 1905 at least deals with prehistory from a time when the boot of repression was on an altogether different foot contemplation is warmly encouraged in any case by a superb new recording of the work with shostakovich 's great friend mstislav rostropovich conducting the london symphony on the orchestra 's own label lso live wwwlsocouk this account recorded at the barbican in march also has pre  and posthistory mr rostropovich made a fine recording of the work with the national symphony in 1992 for teldec some of us fondly recall his performance of it with the chicago symphony in 1999 in addition he brought his london symphony interpretation to avery fisher hall in april it is by now a reading that runs broad and deep the ominously atmospheric and predominantly hushed opening movement palace square runs more than 20 minutes here almost four more than in the teldec version but it is four minutes of heightened almost unbearable tension indeed the whole work four movements without interruption sustains that tension and gathers tremendous momentum in mr rostropovich 's canny pacing a listener who has heard the work live only in america has to salute the barbican audiences at the two performances on which the recording is based nothing can so undermine the effect of that expectant opening movement as continual coughing of a type heard at those american performances and perhaps more surprisingly on a russian disc release of a performance conducted by yevgeny mravinsky in leningrad in 1957 four days after the work 's premiere in moscow the production qualities are excellent with releases like this and recordings of berlioz dvorak and elgar conducted by colin davis the label has quickly established itself on the international scene james r oestreich
