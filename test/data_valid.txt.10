as soon as the first reports of a plane crash near kennedy airport in queens commandeered television screens yesterday morning some stations quietly removed the red white and blue logos and american flags from their broadcasts any suggestion even a subliminal one that this airplane disaster was a continuation of the terrorist attacks of sept 11 could seem premature television journalists are not always known for caution and restraint when reporting breaking news but yesterday anchors repeatedly emphasized that it was wrong to speculate about the cause of a plane crash two months and a day after hijacked planes plowed into the world trade center and the pentagon the urge to reassure and inform with care were at times clashing impulses as maurice dubois an anchor at wnbc put it shortly before 10 am it does not appear to be related to terrorism but obviously we can not say that just yet as americans once again clustered around television sets yesterday 's national and local television coverage of the crash showed all too familiar images of screeching firetrucks black smoke and stricken onlookers it also provided a clearer than usual look at the competitive scramble to cover breaking news wabc tv news the new york abc affiliate was the first to broadcast footage of the fire raging in belle harbor because a part time employee happened to live in rockaway park and heard the plane crash a few blocks from his house but univision the spanish language network relying on reports from the dominican republic was among the first to identify the plane as an airbus not a 767 as other networks had reported and to report that the plane had been headed for santo domingo by midmorning msnbc had ashleigh banfield freshly back from pakistan reporting from queens without any footage of the fire while cnn was interviewing a santo domingo airport spokesman by telephone and other new york stations were interviewing queens witnesses by telephone univision was broadcasting harrowing live footage of victims relatives collapsing in grief at the santo domingo airport the day began with sketchy details looks of shock and caution erik sorenson msnbc 's president removed the flag motif lest it imply that the crash was related to events of sept 11 we did not think that there was any kind of an america against the rest of the world issue with this story mr sorenson said if it turns into that you might see that stars and stripes motif cnn also removed its stars and stripes motif from its banner when news about the crash was sketchiest but put it back later in the afternoon christa robinson a spokeswoman said removing the flag was purely a graphics design decision fox news said its flag motif remained because we 're still at war there were a few early inaccuracies citing city officials statements and wire service reports cnn reported first and like others incorrectly that the airplane was a boeing 767 many news programs made the ominous point that the two hijacked planes that crashed into the towers of world trade center were also 767 's at 9 40 the morning anchor of fox news held aloft a model of a boeing 767 wabc and univision led the pack in correcting the record wabc news was also the first to get a reporter lisa colagrossi to the site for a live standup at 10 22 as she spoke into the camera against a backdrop of firetrucks and police cars wcbs 's jennifer mclogan was phoning in what she could see her location was identified as near the scene within half an hour abc was able to broadcast the fire blazing in belle harbor thanks to kevin cohen an independent videojournalist who often works with wabc tv and lives six blocks from where the plane debris fell i heard a kind of low flying aircraft type sound mr cohen recalled and then i felt a rumbling on the ground i checked to see if my camera was working and got there within 10 minutes cnn which has an arrangement with abc quickly began using the fire footage crediting abc other local news stations including wcbs have their own deals with cnn and also used the footage nbc however does not have a relationship with cnn though it dispatched four trucks and eight reporters wnbc was not able to transmit its own footage because its microwave truck got stuck at police blockades until almost noon wnbc was showing distant images of smoke inset into maps of queens wabc which scheduled a news update during the half time of monday night football stopped showing commercials for much of the day hundreds of people died today and a lot of them are our people new yorkers daniel forman news director of wabc tv explained
