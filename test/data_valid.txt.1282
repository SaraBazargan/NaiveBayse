facing a deep deficit in the state budget gov george e pataki today hitched new york 's financial recovery to the bush administration 's plans for healing the national recession a swift new round of tax cuts specifically the governor singled out for praise a proposal to eliminate taxes on corporate dividends paid to taxpayers the centerpiece of the plan president bush announced on jan 7 for kick starting the stalled economy the president 's new economic stimulus plan will help new yorkers specifically his proposal to eliminate the double taxation of dividends mr pataki said in his first public statements since the bush announcement this element of his stimulus package will help a financial industry in new york that is hurting but mr pataki was noticeably silent on the question of whether new york whose income tax laws are tied to the federal laws would enact changes to keep it from automatically following the federal government 's lead some state officials mostly democrats have said that the bush proposal will hurt new york at a time when it faces a cumulative deficit of 12 billion and needs every source of revenue it possesses alan g hevesi the state comptroller said that if the state piggybacks on the federal plan and decides it will also stop collecting a dividend tax it could lose 551 million in revenues in the fiscal year that begins april 1 and 25 billion over four years mr pataki 's remarks delivered in a speech to business leaders community groups and politicians here were the first he has made about an issue that has reignited a battle between republicans and democrats that traces back to the reagan tax cuts of the early 1980 's politically such strong support for the president aligns mr pataki more closely with the fiscal conservatives in his republican party who believe it is unfair to double tax first by taxing corporate profits and then the money sent to shareholders but beyond putting him in a better position to bid for national office if the opportunity arises the governor said the proposal meshed with his philosophy that low taxation and job protection were the way to help the state overcome its deficit this year and next ending the punitive double taxation of dividends will help lift and rally the stock market will help rationalize corporate finance decisions strengthen investor confidence and protect retirement income for seniors mr pataki said in a speech at the vanderbilt a white columned catering hall in nassau county it will help our major financial institutions here in new york and as a result the president 's plan will help new york more than any other state in america because we are the financial capital of the world mr pataki continued it will mean new york jobs for new york families mr pataki 's speech was similar to one he delivered in manhattan two days ago a third speech is planned for syracuse on monday before the governor 's budget address on wednesday in which he will lay out exactly how he intends to close the gap at one point in his speech mr pataki said his budget would include tax incentives for small businesses particularly those in the high tech field who add jobs in the state but the speeches despite their tone of optimism reflect how deeply mr pataki feels he must prepare the public for a painfully austere budget his aides said assembly speaker sheldon silver a democrat was critical of the lack of details in the governor 's speech today he also laced into decisions by the state university of new york to raise tuition and the metropolitan transportation authority to possibly raise subway fares both are agencies the governor controls overall the few specifics contained in the speech provide little comfort to the state 's working families facing back door tax increases said eileen larrabee a spokeswoman for mr silver mr pataki who spoke to an audience of about 700 suburbanites acknowledged that he understood that county and local governments were now feeling the effects of the national recession and hoping for fiscal relief from the state the only insight he would offer was a reference to medicaid which pays for health care for the poor and whose costs are shared with localities mr pataki said he would include a medicaid cost containment package in his budget proposal that would generate tens of millions of dollars for nassau and suffolk some in the audience applauded but the governor did not say how he would cut medicaid the largest part of the state budget some people said later that they hoped the remarks would not translate into dramatic cuts affecting the state 's growing elderly population people are going to lose their health services said lisa tyson director of the long island progressive coalition a grassroots nonprofit group and also it is going to mean that local property taxes are going to have to be raised because localities are going to be getting less money for all different types of services outside the vanderbilt a group of about two dozen students chanted in the cold poking cardboard signs into the sky protesting the suny tuition increases these sort of proposals are indeed job killing tax hikes said miriam kramer the coordinator on higher education for the new york public interest research group which organized the protest
