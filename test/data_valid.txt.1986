falun gong 's challenge to china spiritual practice or evil cult by danny schechter akashic 24 even by its own brass knuckled norms the chinese government is waging an extraordinarily vicious campaign against falun gong a shadowy avowedly nonpolitical movement whose methods of cultivating body mind and spirit have won many disciples in china and abroad why an organization that seems to want nothing more than the right to perform calisthenics in the park and whose membership appears to consist mainly of retirees has been deemed an evil cult and mortal threat by beijing is the question at the heart of danny schechter 's falun gong 's challenge to china the book is divided into two sections the first presents a history of falun gong describes its exercise regimen and ethical doctrines and examines in detail the effort to suppress it the second offers a collection of documents relating primarily to the crackdown including a number of testimonials from falun gong practitioners said to have been arrested and beaten by the police these statements with worshipful references to the group 's leader li hongzhi and claims of miracle cures and supernatural phenomena suggest that in china at least it is indeed a cult schechter a journalist and the author of the more you watch the less you know believes otherwise and generally takes a rose tinted view of falun gong despite his admitted bias and his clumsy meandering prose he does offer a persuasive analysis of this strange and still unfolding story falun gong he contends is a balm for millions of chinese two million by beijing 's count 100 million according to the sect itself left cold by two decades of market leninism and its vast following achieved in part through use of the internet is an intolerable challenge to a regime that has always sought to control not only the actions of its citizens but also their thoughts michael steinberger
