before every game this season larry robinson wrote the word discipline on the blackboard in the devils dressing room with their coach 's handwriting on the wall the devils unraveled tonight in game 7 of the stanley cup finals completing their demise which began when they squandered the chance to win the cup at home thursday in game 6 the devils exhibited the jarring inconsistency the gaps in intensity and the ill advised penalties that plagued them throughout the playoffs disciplined hockey wins championships robinson said repeating a message he delivered often to surprisingly deaf ears on a night when patrick roy and the colorado avalanche were at their best the devils hurt their hopes to defend their stanley cup championship with mistakes the avalanche playing with purpose won the cup with a 3 1 victory the thing that inevitably beat us was the same thing that we have been guilty of the whole series taking stupid penalities robinson said needless penalties you are playing against a great team and you are punching guys in the face for no reason i mean this is the seventh game of the finals if you ca n't suck it up for the seventh game then you got problems the devils gave the avalanche six power plays two in each period the avalanche scored its third and final goal in the second period on a power play after sean o'donnell went to the box for high sticking he appeared to hit shjon podein with the butt end of his stick it bothers me because i was in the box when they scored a goal o'donnell said obviously i let my teammates down sometimes your emotions do get the best of you or the worst we did n't have as much composure as last year scott stevens the team captain said the lack of discipline he said had its seeds in game 6 which the devils lost 4 0 we 've got to have the killer instinct to win it in our own building stevens said the devils played a surprisingly languid game tonight late in the first period petr sykora tried to change the momentum when he rocketed a high slap shot to patrick roy 's stick side sykora 's blast struck the post with 1 minute 40 seconds left in the first period and it ricocheted almost to the blue line allowing the avalanche to keep its 1 0 lead for the devils the ping was sickening a reverberating reminder of failure the devils left themselves no room for error tonight not even a couple of inches despite sykora 's five shots on goal and his emotional play the sputtering offense against roy the conn smythe trophy winner did not allow for defensive lapses it 's disappointing when you feel like you gave them most of their things defenseman ken daneyko said we made some mistakes early and it cost us they do n't need a lot of chances to capitalize the devils made it difficult for themselves throughout these playoffs and this game followed the pattern by the time the devils scored their first goal the avalanche had three on 12 shots the devils already had two come from behind victories in this series and seven over all in the playoffs but not tonight as in game 6 brodeur gave up three goals on the first 12 shots he was not at his best in the most crucial games in the series brodeur allowed 19 goals in the finals while the devils could manage only 11 his supporting cast did not help robinson had put o'donnell on the bench the previous two games for ken sutton but brought o'donnell back tonight o'donnell had compiled 39 penalty minutes before game 7 second on the team to colin white o'donnell 's mistake gave colorado a power play and joe sakic scored his 13th goal of the playoffs after he scored at 6 16 of the second period the devils seemed to find their hunger again but it was too late sykora scored on roy at 9 33 of the second period breaking up the shutout but that was all for the devils they were called for two more penalties in the third period preventing them from getting good chances to score white got a penalty for high sticking at 10 32 of the third period effectively killing any momentum the devils were trying to gather throughout the playoffs robinson warned his players about taking stupid penalties and even benched white in the toronto series because of it last year robinson said we took elbows and the high sticks and all of those things this year we did not
