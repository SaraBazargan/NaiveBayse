as financial markets reopen today after the three day hiatus that is the unofficial end of summer analysts say they see little evidence to suggest that stock market indexes are poised to move markedly higher still there appears less risk that stocks will move through recent lows i think the market has made a bottom and wo n't retest it said laszlo birinyi global trading strategist at deutsche bank the broad market will do better but it wo n't get up and run away indeed despite several outstanding issues the odds suggest that september will be a better month for the stock market if only because the spring and the summer were so poor consider that the dow jones industrial average fell for the fifth consecutive month in august that has not happened since september 1981 for the year the blue chip index is down 1355 percent what is more the nasdaq composite index down a whopping 326 percent this year has also declined for five consecutive months the standard poor 's 500 stock index rallied strongly from its july lows but it backed off as august progressed and closed with a barely noticeable gain of 05 percent not surprisingly the steep decline in prices coupled with uncertainties about corporate governance the war on terrorism the economy and earnings have left investors disheartened and insecure said thomas galvin chief investment officer at credit suisse first boston unfortunately based on the recent past september has not been a month when spirits lifted and markets flourished in 1998 investors had to cope with the aftermath of russia 's default and the collapse of long term capital management a year later year 2000 and computer difficulties were the big worries september of 2000 marked the beginning of the final push to the presidential elections and all the foment that the result of that contest generated and the anniversary of sept 11 is now approaching as this september begins the state of the economy is of primary concern the american consumer a huge source of strength over the last two years can not be expected to continue carrying the economy analysts say people have been rightly concerned about the legs of the consumer said thomas mcmanus chief investment strategist at banc of america securities until we get an answer to the question of what will create a more balanced recovery until the recovery broadens out stocks will move sideways to slightly higher mr mcmanus said as recently as july most analysts expected the economy to build momentum as it moved into the second half of the year pulling corporate profits higher a string of reports that were weaker than expected severely dampened those expectations and prompted a number of prominent economists to predict that the federal reserve will move to cut short term interest rates this fall possibly on sept 24 when policy makers are to meet next expectations of a rate cut have been lowered in recent weeks but they could surge anew if data to be released this week starting with the august report from the nation 's purchasing managers scheduled to be released this morning show that business conditions remain soft and on friday financial markets will take a fresh look at labor conditions when the government releases its august employment report whatever those numbers show analysts say they are unlikely to suggest that the economy which expanded at an annual rate of 11 percent in the second quarter has rebounded sharply this summer and a marked pickup from the current pace will be needed to generate healthy profit growth you need to get nominal growth in gross domestic product of up to 5 percent to get double digit profit growth mr galvin said although the recession that now appears to be over was short and shallow the falloff in output from the boom of the late 1990 's has been pronounced mr mcmanus noted for almost five years gross domestic product on an inflation adjusted basis grew at 4 percent a year he said over the last seven quarters it has grown at a 1 percent rate even as economists are ratcheting down their growth forecasts for the second half wall street analysts remain optimistic that corporate profits will show a healthy improvement from a year ago if only because business in the third and fourth quarters of 2001 was so bad still the dichotomy has many stock market strategists worried earnings estimates were way too high and will have to come down mr mcmanus said thomson first call which compiles earnings estimates from wall street analysts now projects that third quarter profits will be up 112 percent from a year earlier in the second quarter corporate earnings were up 14 percent according to thomson first call the first positive gain in five quarters chuck hill the firm 's research director said last week that recent announcements from a number of companies whose fiscal third quarter ends in september suggested that although the profit picture was not deteriorating further it was not improving much either as the nation returns to work and children slog back to school there does not appear to be a catalyst that will generate much momentum in the equity market the consumer is tired and businesses are n't spending mr galvin said this is not the stage for investors to get excited about stocks
