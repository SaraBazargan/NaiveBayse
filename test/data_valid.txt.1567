everyone knows it is a mother 's right to make remarks on a son 's appearance from facial hair to slide sandals but for years i 've been on my mom 's case too like many daughters of the depression she is conflicted about spending money or time on fashion and hates shopping when she was younger she got away with this nonapproach because she was an obvious beauty now that she 's living with a chronic illness dressing herself to distract from her fragility seems especially crucial to me and it is harder than ever to control my bossy inner stylist on my visits home when you 're older i tell her busy is better so get out the jewelry on a recent visit i found myself declaring that hairnets were only appropriate for bed and that t shirts for summer were a bad idea with her thin neck and arms i know i should n't have said anything since she is trying to make peace with her physical condition and is not after all an apartment one can just decorate to taste but in some ways a mom is a home too is n't she besides it was clear to me she 'd be more attractive in half sleeved button down blouses and by the way why was she wearing such dowdy pants and bedroom slippers did n't she want to look her best eventually my questions roused her from her torpor ok then she said take me to macy 's and off we went having style issues with one 's mom it turns out is n't so unusual among the fashion conscious growing up simon doonan the creative director of barneys new york recalled asking his mom why ca n't you dress like that while watching the plumed ladies on elephants at the circus lulu johnson a sleek young minimalist designer whose mother is the outrageous betsey johnson remembers being mortified as a teenager at the remarks made by her classmates about her mother 's wild style even michael kors who credits his mother 's subtle taste as inspirational finds himself stridently art directing her on occasion she makes mistakes too and i 'm blunt he said i 'll tell her she ca n't wear black loafers with the chamois pants suit and she says 'i did n't ask you did i i know how he feels still my mom 's more like the designer cynthia rowley 's mom she 's lovely but clueless about fashion she said of her mom who lives in barrington ill if i give her a beautiful coat from my collection she 'll ask if she can wear it for bowling if i put her in heels she 'll walk around holding onto the furniture if her taste were just a little worse she continued it might inspire me with some wacky design ideas but that 's where my dad comes in he 's got looks going on with plaids and earmuffs that would blow your mind ultimately ms rowley advised me to let it go with my mom yet as modest and mundane as it was my trip with mom to macy 's seemed to be lifting her spirits immensely we found the half sleeve style of shirt that i had envisioned for her and it suited her so perfectly she bought three i convinced her to buy solid colored t shirts for underneath and then found my inner stylist explaining the concept of color blocking even as shoppers and saleswomen looked on with raised eyebrows we found the brand of elastic waist pants she prefers and on another floor she tried on hats that would keep her hairdo from blowing in the wind she is n't a hat person who is really and none of them worked but as i carefully put each of them on her head and pointed her into the mirror she looked at herself and laughed with a lightness i had n't seen in years back home she had the energy to try everything on again before bed thank you my little personal shopper she said shakespeare wrote thou are thy mother 's glass and she in thee calls back the lovely april of her prime he 's right of course it 's just that even at my age when i should know better i ca n't help being the mirror that calls it as it is right now weeks later mom is constantly wearing the shirts we bought together sometimes with pearls even and getting compliments that have more of an effect on her than all the pills in her medicine basket so you see mom style does matter i told her i do n't know about style she said but those are very nice shirts
