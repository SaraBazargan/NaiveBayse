among the indelible images of american wartime presidents two stand out in this moment of talk of a war against iraq during the vietnam war president lyndon b johnson a man with little military expertise obsessively approved bombing targets himself fearing that an aggressive air war would provoke russian or chinese counterattacks johnson 's famous caution helped create a widely accepted myth that vietnam was lost in part because of artificial restraints by a tremulous commander in chief who had no business second guessing his military leaders that way a second image is of abraham lincoln also a man with little military expertise constantly second guessing his generals tactics because they were not aggressive enough when gen george mcclellan complained that his horses were too fatigued to chase the confederate army lincoln asked will you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done since the battle of antietam that fatigue anything mcclellan was one of many generals lincoln dismissed over such disagreements the cases of johnson 's and lincoln 's micromanaging of their wars are cited in an illuminating new book supreme command by eliot a cohen who argues that johnson 's concern about outside intervention may have been wrong but it was not unreasonable mr cohen 's thesis is that all successful wartime presidents must be willing to overrule their military commanders what makes mr cohen 's views relevant is that president bush another man with limited military expertise read supreme command this summer karl rove mr bush 's political adviser suggested that he read it a white house official says there is an interesting history of presidents reading books about the military the presidential historian richard reeves recalls for example that president john kennedy ordered the top people at the pentagon to read barbara tuchman 's the guns of august so they would understand how a series of escalations and miscalculations on all sides led to world war i later in the cuban missile crisis of 1962 kennedy 's caution compelled him to reject advice from some of his top military commanders to strike against cuban missile bases a senior adviser to president bill clinton recalls that mr clinton also understood the need to overrule the military but had been reluctant to deepen their already serious distrust of him as commander various memoirs tell how mr clinton yielded to the military 's warnings of unacceptable casualty levels and decided against using american forces to arrest people accused of war crimes in the balkans in the mid 1990 's mr bush came into office with support in the military but he is now said to be steeling himself to stand up to it if it opposes going to war with iraq in a broadcast last week the president told scott pelley of cbs 's 60 minutes ii that there 's a lot of nervous nellies at the pentagon when it comes to taking military action one of the most senior military people advising him turns out to be not at the pentagon but at the state department where secretary colin powell is known to advocate a cautious approach on iraq against mr powell an author of the doctrine that waging war requires along with political support at home and an exit strategy the use of overwhelming force are vice president dick cheney and defense secretary donald rumsfeld whose article advocating a pre emptive strike against iraq was recently pulled from the washington post at the last minute because of fear at the white house that it might undermine the claim that mr bush had not decided the issue mr cheney and mr rumsfeld are acting as both public lobbyists and private advisers to mr bush but a white house official says that mr bush already understands that he must in the end make decisions himself only he can bring to the decision making process a full range of calculations based on political diplomatic and human factors including the risks of doing nothing or of doing something that is bound to produce unintended consequences a prominent republican defense intellectual adds that right now general powell and many at the pentagon are afflicted with mcclellanism a reluctance to prosecute any war aggressively even so the aide to mr clinton wondered how easy it would be for mr bush to overrule military experts who warned of the sacrifice in lives a strike would entail the military have to do what the president says the clinton aide said but only a president who is suicidal would order the military to do something that they formally tell him carries an unacceptable risk of casualties all the more reason for the president to be thinking about history it 's probably a good thing that bush is reading the cohen book said michael o'hanlon a defense expert at the brookings institution when you 're in his position whether the arguments are strong or not the decision is ultimately a lonely one you can have all the rummies and cheneys around you but you 're the only one who 's got to decide to send in the troops it 's got to be a very emotionally draining and challenging thing
