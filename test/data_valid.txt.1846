the web of hand dug tunnels extends deep into the bowels of the mountain south of the city offering concealment and security well worn carpets line the three miles of dirt floors and electric lights hang from the ceilings intelligence officials suspect that osama bin laden the fugitive terrorist may be hiding in this kind of maze somewhere across the border in afghanistan but the underground labyrinth here is a sanctuary of a different sort thousands of multicolored cloth bags filled with worn tattered copies of the koran the holy book of islam line its rock studded walls from floor to ceiling no one knows precisely how many discarded korans have found their final resting place here there are about 65000 bags containing somewhere between three million and four million books and countless loose pages more books arrive regularly by the truckload from across the country our one and only aim is to save and respect the holy book allah noor daavi a businessman who helped organize the project said in an interview bibles and torahs are welcome too at a time when religion is wielded as a weapon of division and anger in pakistan the repository reflects a solemn vision of islam and religion in general its sponsors have eluded the fury embraced in many quarters of the city where leaders of the taliban movement were educated and where they maintain support mr daavi who owns the massey ferguson farm machinery franchise in quetta said the group had purposely avoided aligning itself with any religious or political party to avoid any taint the project was the vision of muhammad wali an unassuming man of modest means one day in 1980 as he rode his bicycle through quetta he saw torn pieces of a koran on the side of the road this is not good mr wali recalled thinking these should be saved he began to retrieve the discarded books and loose pages he found along the road and in trash bins along the way he discovered that people often left their old korans in graveyards so he added cemeteries to his itinerary mr wali stored the books in his small house for years when they began to crowd out his family in 1992 he turned for help to four wealthy businessmen at that point the project became more ambitious and a bit mystical instead of a simple warehouse the men wanted a more respectful and secure storage place they bought a plot of land adjoining a nondescript mountain on the southern outskirts of quetta and named it jabbal e noorul or mountain of light workers were hired to dig the maze of tunnels to keep costs down no beams were used and so the passages had to be narrow to avoid collapse each is about 6 feet wide and 7 feet high only two men at a time could work in the confined space using picks and shovels they spent months carving their way into the mountain eventually digging 12000 feet of linked tunnels five central passages lead about 150 feet into the mountain and a bewildering array of branches fan out from them the branches are numbered to help people find their way lights were strung along the ceilings and carpet was laid on the floors small spaces were dug out at several points along the passageways and their floors and walls were covered with carpets so they could serve as prayer rooms despite the dangerous labor in difficult conditions mr daavi said no worker had suffered even a minor injury he and his friends took that as a sign of divine protection their beliefs were reinforced in 1998 when an earthquake rocked quetta but did not disturb a single stone within the tunnels mr daavi said the project did not stop with the elaborate storage system as korans were collected from mosques schools and trash heaps mr wali found that many could be restored a small room was built near the main tunnel entrance two binders work there every day repairing books that can be salvaged the repaired books are donated to religious schools known as madrassahs for students who can not afford new ones on a recent day nearly 100000 korans were stacked up awaiting repairs mr daavi said he and the other businessmen had paid for the work and the collection of korans though small amounts were donated by visitors people also can buy a foot of storage space for their old korans for 250 rupees about 4 as word of the effort spread truckloads of old korans and sacks of loose pages began to arrive from throughout pakistan so far no worn out bibles or torahs have arrived but mr daavi said the project would be happy to take them we respect all the holy books he said the tunnels have a capacity of about a million bags and mr daavi said he expected the project to continue long after his death when that time comes his own resting place will not be far away graves have been dug near the entrance to the tunnels for mr wali and the businessmen who financed his dream
