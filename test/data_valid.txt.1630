to the editor re when books break the bank college students venture beyond the campus store front page sept 16 it is comforting to know that there are so many others in my position paying 40000 a year for college and then having to spend hundreds on overpriced textbooks is absurd this semester at brandeis i am taking astronomy which requires a 95 textbook i am sharing it with two students one of whom lives on the opposite side of campus it 's a hassle but we 've worked it out i will continue to shop online and as an older and wiser sophomore am advising clueless freshmen to do so yes i have to pay for shipping and wait to get the books but i refuse to pay 80 when i can pay 25 i may just be a naive college student but i 'm hoping that publishers will wake up and give my parents wallet a break emily loubaton waltham mass sept 16 2003
