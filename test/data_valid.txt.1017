to the editor a feb 15 letter about aids in africa says states should not be expected to value the lives of noncitizens as much as citizens in international relations the prestige of a country is every bit as relevant as the actual actions of that country and its citizens if americans were to take on the social responsibility to care for aids sufferers around the world we might be acting foolishly but we would undeniably enhance our country 's prestige the united states should send aid overseas to help aids patients because not only could it directly affect americans for example it might lead to more research and improved care for american aids patients but it would also provide the international prestige so necessary to a nation 's survival wes meltzer portland ore feb 15 2001
