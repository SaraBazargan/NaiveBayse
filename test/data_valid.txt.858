angel cordero jr the retired hall of fame jockey now hustling rides as an agent for john velazquez calls the skittish chestnut lefty the trainer todd pletcher thinks the horse that has been in his barn for three years is something of a goofball but a lovable one today in the toughest test for older horses so far this year their patience with and their fondness for left bank paid off not only did left bank rout a stellar field of current and future stars in the grade i 750000 whitney handicap but he also tied the 28 year old saratoga track record set by tri jet zipping the mile and an eighth in 1 4704 to win by a length and a quarter left back turned back the even money favorite street cry who entered the race after two dominant victories and with a reputation as the best horse in the world lido palace the whitney 's defending champion finished third left bank demonstrated that quirks and all he is much more than a former top class sprinter he stays like this he can go anywhere and beat anyone said velazquez who earned his first victory in the whitney traditionally one of the top races in the united states pletcher 35 gilded his resume as a top trainer by bringing home the whitney trophy with a horse who had not contested a race longer than a mile in two years and was coming off a track record setting performance last month at belmont park at seven furlongs some races are bigger than others and we 've been excited about trying this one for a while said pletcher who helped the horse 's owner michael tabor win the 450000 first place check it increased left bank 's bankroll to more than 14 million this is the best group of horses put together all year pletcher said the race set up for everybody and nobody had an excuse right now we have the top handicap horse around we do n't take a back seat to anyone before the gates popped here in front of a revved up crowd of 42379 all eyes and expectations were on street cry the jockey jerry bailey said street cry reminded him of the great cigar after he won back to back grade i 's including an emphatic victory in the world 's richest race the 6 million dubai world cup the 4 year old son of machiavellian street cry hardly embarrassed himself by finishing second but bailey perhaps was outparried by a crafty ride by velazquez the person chasing him in the jockeys standing left bank 's chances looked compromised thursday when another front runner saint verre was a last minute entry in the race in the paddock before the race pletcher told velazquez either get ahead of saint verre or behind but do not go head to head when the jockey jean luc samyn gunned his colt to rapid fractions velazquez ignored saint verre 's three length lead and loped left bank down the backstretch the strategy was to break and run away from the gate and if saint verre wanted to clear then fine and we could go to the outside pletcher said going into the first turn it unfolded no better than we could have hoped the fractions were fast but he was far enough behind and far enough ahead of the rest of the field and he was traveling comfortably behind left bank by as many as six lengths street cry and lido palace with jorge chavez aboard jockeyed for tactical position heading into the stretch each horse 's rider believed the fractions would burn out saint verre and left bank samyn and his horse faltered but velazquez and left bank rocketed into the stretch with a two and a half length lead at the quarter pole i was still worried they might catch him at the eighth pole i was out of my seat pletcher said bailey and chavez quit dueling and took aim at left bank but by then it was too late i was running hard but he was running harder bailey said we just could n't catch him those who believed in the high strung colt were rewarded with a 920 payoff for a 2 bet to win we 've had him since he was a 2 year old he 's never left us pletcher said you still have to take him out on the track with a lead pony and he needs constant baby sitting but it 's really gratifying to win with one you feel like has been a member of your family for so long
