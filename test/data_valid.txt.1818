to the editor i am not surprised that a survey found that black people are 40 percent less likely to experience depression than hispanic or white people front page june 18 this may be due to the cultural family and spiritual resources found in the black community but when blacks do become depressed they may not fare as well unless their treatment and their cultural context are integrated my experience as a clinical social worker and as the chaplain of yale university suggests that there is a great need for integrating mental health services into primary health care this approach would best use the skills of both doctors and mental health professionals to benefit those who are suffering emotionally frederick j streets new haven june 18 2003
