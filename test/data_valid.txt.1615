peter verniero could have gone back to morristown to golf and spend clients money a moderately big deal still addressed as general by the occasional lawyer or waiter it 's not as good as being attorney general but it sounds better than being the clarence thomas of the new jersey supreme court justice verniero sat alone last week as justice thomas did 10 years ago the center of a scene that is likely to identify him in the public mind forever even if he turns out to be another felix frankfurter his best known case will be verniero v senate judiciary committee the committee hearings are supposed to be an examination of racial profiling by the state police but to this point they are an examination of how peter verniero as attorney general handled racial profiling and as the democrats wound up his 13 hour day of testimony last wednesday the principal question was whether he lied to them two years ago even without goofy touches like long dong silver the hearings have become entertainment while his questioners were marching him along the paper trail with all the excitement that could be expected to attend the sixth page of an attachment to a memorandum analyzing traffic stops by the moorestown barracks legislative aides and reporters were making bets on whether justice verniero was toast or just target practice whichever he is he will probably always stand a bit apart from the other justices this is a new one for the new jersey supreme court unlike new hampshire where a supreme court justice was recently accused of stacking the panel that was hearing another justice 's divorce case or pennsylvania which had to remove a justice convicted of having court employees get prescription tranquilizers for him under their names the new jersey court has always been the picture of seemliness the late chief justice robert n wilentz almost lost a reappointment vote in the senate but the only charge against him was not living in new jersey which turned out to be perfectly all right with most people as to whether mr verniero 's problems will do any damage to the court the other justices are absolutely silent of course and on the record so are all the lawyers who might ever have a case before the court and most of those who wo n't but many speak of a certain dulling of reputation for the court even while it is still among the best regarded in the country and say diplomatically that christie whitman 's appointees are perhaps not the people they would have chosen legislators have been less diplomatic during the whitman administration the supreme court became a wholly owned subsidiary of the executive branch said senator john a lynch the judiciary committee 's ranking democrat unlike justice thomas justice verniero has spoken for himself on the court and is known as productive and bright and for the record he wrote a decision last year affirming the suppression of evidence in a warrantless search of a car stopped by police i ca n't fault his behavior on the court said frank askin the director of the constitutional litigation clinic at rutgers law school who unsurprisingly prefers less conservative judges he 's been reasonably fair but like justice thomas he still takes shots from those who say he should not have been nominated in the first place many senators probably more than half would like to rerun the day in may 1999 when they confirmed the nomination by one vote they approved a 40 year old lawyer who had virtually no experience in court and they did it for mrs whitman who rarely bothered to consult even the republicans among them the judiciary committee chairman william l gormley pushed the nomination through over democrats objections but last week he was on their side questioning justice verniero about discrepancies in his testimony while mr verniero pleaded confusion the senator set him up fore more i wish i was the detail person you were senator gormley said in a blood chilling tone i mean you 're very focused very bright very bright which raises the question is it more embarrassing to appear as an equal employment opportunity commission director accused of sexual harassment or a former attorney general accused of hiding things from the justice department reasonable minds can differ on politics laura mansnerus reports on legal affairs for the new york times
