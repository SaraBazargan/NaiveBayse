when he learned that dan o'brien had withdrawn from the olympic trials decathlon with a foot injury chris huffins thought someone was joking o'brien is the current olympic champion and the former world record holder the one decathlete huffins had never defeated o'brien has served as sort of a mirror in which huffins has measured his own reflection i did n't believe it said huffins a native of brooklyn who will be an assistant track coach at georgia tech this fall it 's like reading a book and you have the ending predicted and it 's really stupid and you think 'it 's not supposed to end like that this was the year when huffins a two time national champion figured he would finally defeat o'brien at the olympic trials no less huffins won a bronze medal at the 1999 world championships and is expected to challenge for a medal in september at the 2000 summer games in sydney australia but o'brien is gone from the trials and huffins 's main competitor now is himself not any opponent the decathlon began tonight with huffins 's two strongest events the 100 meters and the long jump huffins holds the world record for the decathlon 100 1022 seconds set at the 1996 olympic trials his personal best in the long jump 26 feet 5 3 4 inches is less than 2 inches shorter than the third place finisher leaped monday night in the open long jump final huffins held first place after four events tonight winning the 100 in 1045 and the long jump at 25 10 and throwing the shot put 47 11 and leaping 6 11 in the high jump if i do my absolute best i believe i will win the 30 year old huffins said of the olympic decathlon however his personal best of 8694 points lags well behind the world record of 8994 points set by tomas dvorak of the czech republic who is the overwhelming olympic favorite huffins 's weakness is related to his strength running while he has a sprinter 's searing speed at 100 meters and his personal best at the nondecathlon event of 200 meters is 2078 seconds huffins has run 400 meters no faster than 4805 and the 1500 meters in 4 minutes 5120 seconds this time in the metric mile is 17 seconds slower than o'brien 's personal best and appears to have become a sort of psychological hurdle for huffins he did not finish the decathlon at the 1997 world track championships in athens or at an important meet in gotzis austria earlier this year skipping the 1500 both times if huffins is to challenge for a gold medal in sydney o'brien said he must learn to convert his sprinter 's speed to the longer running events and to specific technical events such as the pole vault where his best is an ordinary 16  3 4 a foot shorter than o'brien 's best it 's just knowing that he can compete at that level and going after the 400 o'brien said of huffins he can run 21 flat in the 200 and 48 in the quarter that has never made sense to me and his pole vault run is not what his long jump run is it should be this season huffins said he has paid more attention to running during training he believes he is better prepared to deal with the final exhausting meters of the 400 where according to the world record holder michael johnson your body is totally fatigued and wants to flop all over the track all the components are there huffins said in the quarter mile it 's learning how to deal with the demons in the last portion growing up in the bedford stuyvesant section of brooklyn huffins never expected to become a decathlete when he was 11 he moved to indianapolis to join his mother sandra gay who had studied drama and education at fordham university and who wanted her son to concentrate on his schoolwork not athletics limited to one sport huffins chose basketball over track and field his mother later relented during her son 's career at cathedral high in indianapolis and huffins leaped 23 6 1 2 in the long jump reached the state semifinals at 100 meters and earned a scholarship to california berkeley where he received a degree in the political economies of industrial society he first became intrigued by the decathlon in 1991 during a redshirt season at cal depending on what story is to be believed huffins either bragged to coach ed miller i can do that or took miller 's suggestion that training for a decathlon would aid his sprinting long jumping and triple jumping that was a great big farce but i was young and dumb and it worked huffins said he scored 7531 points in his first decathlon thought he was awful but persisted after miller encouraged him his second decathlon qualified him for the 1992 olympic trials and his third decathlon came at those infamous trials in new orleans where o'brien failed to clear a height in the pole vault unaware that o'brien was an olympic favorite huffins said he made a friendly bet with o'brien that he could beat him in the long jump he was standing on a parallel runway when o'brien missed on his third attempt to clear a height in the pole vault failing to qualify for the summer games in barcelona spain even with a successful pole vault huffins finished 15th at the 1992 trials four places behind o'brien at the 1996 trials huffins finished third a month later he took 10th at the atlanta games while o'brien took the gold medal huffins later won two national titles but o'brien did not compete because of injury the 2000 olympic trials would finally signal the changing of the decathlon guard huffins believed then o'brien withdrew everything was building to a crescendo and now it does n't happen huffins said but he added the outcome will not be altered even if the competition has been i do n't think the victor is going to be any different than it would have been in the first place huffins said inside track derrick adkins the defending olympic champion in the 400 meter hurdles advanced to the next round in the event winning his opening heat in 4984 seconds hazel clark ran the fastest time 2 0178 in the women 's 800 hazel 's sister in law jearl miles clark 2 0207 was second fastest and her sister joetta clark 2 0211 was third fastest
