i enjoyed your article about the new roundabout in huntington a slower huntington likes roundabout dec 22 however i find it suspiciously similar to the two traffic circles that have been in operation in riverhead for decades they are quite efficient in light to moderate traffic and when traffic is not overwhelmingly dominated by one pattern of flow i like the huntington roundabout 's provision for pedestrian traffic here it is quite dangerous to cross the roads on foot but i suspect he people in huntington will need a lot of driver education to make it work we still have drivers who think the major road has the right of way despite the signs alan daters riverhead
