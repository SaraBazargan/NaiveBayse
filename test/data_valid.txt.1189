the jets have never felt quite at home at giants stadium the giants got there first so their name is on the building not the jets' the giants have won two super bowls since they moved there the jets none now with an agreement reached tuesday on a plan for the giants to finance the renovation of the stadium the jets may feel even more subservient the deal gives the giants great leverage they are willing to spend up to 300 million so starting next season they will keep all their game revenues and the rent the jets now pay the new jersey sports and exposition authority wo n't this be awkward it would n't be for us john mara the giants executive vice president said no one is saying this outright but the giants will be the jets de facto landlord carl goldberg the chairman of the sports authority said the sports authority will still be the jets landlord but a lot of the talks about economic issues will be between the jets and the giants mara said we will be dealing with them on lease issues the jets are not commenting on the giants deal until they review its details goldberg insisted that the jets should not feel glum that the giants have chosen with the national football league to take the financial risk of revamping the stadium he hopes the deal will lead the jets to stay beyond the expiration of their lease in 2008 even if the jets are pursuing what they believe will be an even better deal at a proposed stadium on the west side of manhattan i think they 'll feel better goldberg said one if the giants find someone willing to buy the naming rights to the stadium it wo n't be giants stadium anymore that should give them some subliminal comfort second they 'll get enhanced revenues because of the renovation without making a capital investment i 'd suggest that would be a significant inducement to get them to stay but the jets are still a tenant and feel they pay too much rent last june they sued the sports authority saying that they had been overcharged 76 million in rent and demanding that their rent 15 percent of gross receipts be reduced to what the giants pay 10 percent the giants got the better deal when they extended their lease to 2026 and the authority has said the jets can pay less if they stay as long as the giants do the jets rest their claim on a clause that says that if the sports authority gives the giants better lease terms the jets have to be treated similarly the agency disagrees reasoning that the lower rent is inextricably tied to the lease extension but the terms have changed again the giants will keep all their game revenues the jets rent revenues and take half of all nonfootball revenues should n't the jets be offered the same terms i do n't believe so goldberg said only one team can renovate the stadium two years ago however the giants and the jets were discussing a joint plan to renovate the stadium mara said the jets were looking at manhattan but still eyeing a potential future in new jersey they were at the table with us mara said we had n't agreed on how we would split renovation costs but they elected to go in a different direction intriguingly mara left the door open would it be possible for the jets if they grew disenchanted with the process in manhattan to split the costs of renovating giants stadium it might be grand mara said but it 's not realistic
