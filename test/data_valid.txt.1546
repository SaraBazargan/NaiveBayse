salmonella the bacteria that can cause food poisoning and even death may have the potential to help certain cancer patients researchers at the yale school of medicine say the bacteria appears to help combat melanoma especially when it is used in conjunction with standard radiation therapy writing in the european journal of cancer they say that they have developed a nontoxic strain of salmonella and then administered it to mice with melanoma tumors the result they reported was a substantial gain in their ability to suppress although not eliminate the tumors the researchers said they were surprised by how much the treatments seemed to reinforce each other while administering radiation or salmonella alone stopped the tumor growth for as long as three weeks the combined treatments were shown to be effective for twice that long odd as the approach may seem injecting bacteria into cancer patients has been done for at least 100 years the pioneer is generally considered to be dr william b coley a new york surgeon whose work helped later generations of oncologists develop the field of cancer immunotherapy still all these years later no one is sure why bacteria seem to help we do n't have any of those answers about how it works said dr john m pawelek the lead author of the study clinical trials are now under way to make sure the modified bacteria are not harmful to people
