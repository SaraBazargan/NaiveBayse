the competitors lined up waiting for the drop of a skull and bones starting flag that fluttered in the breeze exhausts crackled like those of dragsters as the racers barely able to idle jockeyed at the line and gunned custom built engines then they were off on a one mile sprint but there was no burned rubber screech of tires on asphalt instead sheets of salt spray flew into the air as the ultimate challenge 2001 began the latest in a summer long string of lobster boat races along this corrugated coast by reputation maine 's lobstermen and its scattering of lobsterwomen are the quintessence of slow and taciturn the antithesis of speed and flash but flush with income from rising lobster catches in recent years they have turned the informal races held for decades in sleepy spruce fringed harbors into a nautical variant of nascar with some boats reaching speeds of nearly 60 miles an hour it began as the down east equivalent of a texas tractor pull said maury shepherd the executive vice president of the c e shepherd company a houston manufacturer of lobster trap wire and with the monthly commercial fisheries news a sponsor of six races including this one you basically had a bunch of good old boys coming back from checking their pots and wanting to get to the gas dock first mr shepherd said they full bore the throttle and you 've got a race times have changed largely because incomes have risen in a few cases well into six figures a typical lobster boat 20 years ago might have had 150 horsepower in the hold often generated by an engine salvaged from a scrapped buick sedan now many competitors are high revving funny boats topping 900 horsepower with bored out cylinders and transmissions modified to spin propellers at buzz saw speeds most of the boats in the races are still workaday craft but a few were built strictly for racing like james west 's wild wild west which produced thunderstorm rumbles from a pair of exhaust pipes that arced above its transom like chrome tusks corporate sponsorship is starting to build but remains couched in maine style modesty limited to small emblems describing how a particular boat is powered by cummins or volvo or caterpillar the prizes in various races range from gift certificates from the local supermarket and embroidered victory jackets to next year in winter harbor a 30000 35 foot hull the hint of commercialization has led to grumbling among lobster trappers who race strictly as a diversion and prefer the boat they work in but even those whose hulls show scrapes from hauling hundreds of pots over the gunwale say that in the end it is still an awful lot of fun and the prizes do count for something said pat faulkingham who pulled up to the winter harbor town dock on race day in the scruffy rebecca anne still dressed in his stained foul weather pants after hauling lobsters at dawn it 's better than playing the lottery mr faulkingham said as he paid his 20 registration fee there is a detailed rule book now for the sanctioned race series which started in boothbay harbor in june and will end in searsport on aug 26 boat owners are no longer allowed to feed propane or nitrous oxide into the air intakes of their engines techniques that could produce explosive speed or deadly explosions but unlike nascar where inspectors tear down each engine before a race the lobster boat contests are not strictly policed so as a thick knot of boats converged on the dock to register there were glances and playful mutterings from various competitors about the efforts of other racers to gain an edge there was talk of a new waxy coating for the bottom that gave an extra knot or two a teenage deckhand for one boat hauled a 50 pound sack of ice down the steep gangway to the floating dock and then into a skiff having a party another lobsterman asked no it 's a secret said the deckhand blushing through his sunburn icing down your fuel lines makes the fuel denser explained al strout of harpswell who looked up from showing some other lobster trappers the 454 cubic inch chevrolet v 8 that overflowed from the engine compartment of his boat feeding more fuel per second makes for a richer mix in the cylinders he said and that means more speed octane boost one racer said pointing across the tiny harbor to the agitator whose owner dale torrey was pouring something from a blue plastic bottle into his fuel tank mr torrey whose family began fishing in maine in 1700 is one of the founders of winter harbor 's races which started about 40 years ago mr torrey who was vying for the overall championship in his division with jimmy beal from jonesport was unapologetic about efforts to get every last knot out of a boat i had her worked up a bit he said of his engine which was originally rated at 370 horsepower but can deliver 442 shortly after 10 am the talk ended and the action began with boats in various categories lining up and then blasting down a stretch of open waer lined on each side by spectators and racers taking a break between runs a steady chatter on marine radio channel 65 provided commentary and results the smallest boats ran first the winners pulled far out in front of ole mossy whose skipper chris nelson jr was clearly out for the joy of racing and not the thrill of victory one voice stifling a chuckle crackled on the radio i 've got 20 bucks on ole mossy how 'd he do that 's a heated one another answered hard to tell by early afternoon the racers were back at the wharf where they received their awards and began contests to see who could haul traps put in new bait and set them again the fastest by dawn on monday they would be back at work doing the same thing
