to the editor re look to the sun by dale maharidge op ed april 25 here 's why government is not promoting solar energy bonds solar energy is free power no one gets paid again for decades after installation who wants that america leads the world in solar technology and has an extensive sun belt which i too live in today it 's wasteful harmful and shameful for me to be heating water and running appliances from gas oil coal or nuclear power sources but it 's complicated and expensive to convert so while we 're considering cutting taxes a wise tax break for the installation of solar power could help develop the industry and save the planet one home at a time america should be in the forefront of bringing solar power to market rt kara key west fla april 25 2001
