great dramas and grand operas build to memorable farewells and resonant exit lines when the time comes to leave one 's place of employment not everyone is capable of the beau geste or the bon mot some people dream afterward of what they should have could have said others go off with comments and gestures that linger in legend and memory some years ago a management shuffle having cost me my editor 's job at a major publisher i felt most fortunate to be hired almost immediately by a small trade magazine firm as managing editor of its top publication writes theodore lustig now retired and living in morgantown w va on the wednesday of my third week on the job i was called into the editorial director 's office and asked to sign an agreement that said i understood my position was not permanent rather at management 's direction i could be transferred to any other editorial position they designated i found out later the job i held was a lure that got them editors for their less prestigious magazines also the agreement stated that the company could fire me at the end of any workweek if i were given notice before noon on friday when i suggested this latter stipulation was unfair i was told i also had the right to quit any friday if i gave notice before noon the next day during my lunch hour i went to a recruiter who sent me on an interview at a trade association in desperate need of an editor for its monthly magazine their current editor having walked off the job without notice we agreed on terms and i told them to their delighted surprise that i would be on the job the following monday at 11 30 friday morning i walked into the director 's office and had him reiterate the terms of the agreement i then signed it and had him countersign my copy with it in hand i asked him what time it was he said 'it 's 20 minutes to 12 waving the agreement as i walked out the door i said 'i quit after 19 years at a large service corporation 17 of them as a vice president lawrence b kilfoy now of weston conn said he finally realized that at 61 he was too old for further promotion after all he had n't received a salary review for four years mr kilfoy let competitors know he was available within a week he had a new position at a substantial increase in salary and benefits when i resigned i felt like i had spent 19 years working 60 hours a week in a no win rat race he writes on my last day i noticed a pet shop in the hall below our offices in the window was a display of hundreds of mice running around in a large cage mr kilfoy looked at the mice with their white tails and red beady eyes and thought this is the rat race i am leaving he writes i entered the store and purchased two dozen white mice i returned to my office closed the door and let them run loose i put on my suitcoat picked up my briefcase and left that was six years ago and they are still trapping mice the first time pete selkowe had to dismiss someone he was a young night city editor on a midsize daily newspaper in westchester county it was an emotionally trying experience for both him and his victim an error prone reporter who occasionally slept through meetings he was supposed to cover but another memorable dismissal years later took much less out of him says mr selkowe who lives now in racine wis the victim this time was an underperforming sales rep who did n't show up for work on monday writes mr selkowe by then a publisher in carbondale ill or tuesday by wednesday we were worried about him and called his home he told us 'i was n't making my numbers so i fired myself in 1968 when dr robert j broselow now an obstetrician and gynecologist in lubbock tex was a resident in psychiatry in philadelphia he paid for his own psychoanalysis by working several nights a week running a busy emergency department in a hospital in camden nj one night a family practitioner called about a patient with a 'compound fracture who was en route to the er he asked me to call a certain orthopedic doctor to see this patient i complied but dreaded awakening this particular surgeon he continued sure enough after the orthopedic surgeon saw the patient he unmercifully lambasted me for calling him at midnight about a patient who 'obviously does n't have a compound fracture i replied 'if you think you can run this er better than i can you 're welcome to because i 'm leaving i later learned that he was busy until the morning shift came on at 7 and that thereafter there was a noticeable improvement in his treatment of the hospital staff i had been employed as a medical secretary for over 25 years and making top dollar writes connie guerra of bayville ny my boss a surgeon retired and the medical group did n't know what to do with me so they used me as a 'float in various departments after a year i received my review i was told that i was n't working to my capacity and made mistakes 'like what i asked the office manager said i once copied a page two times she also told me that i had to sign a paper that i was warned and would be reviewed again in three months i looked her straight in the eye and said 'sayonara 'what does that mean she asked 'look it up i said and walked out in 1989 ted kruckel was fired from the job of promotion director of details magazine for reasons too bizarre and long forgotten they did however offer to throw me a goodbye party writes mr kruckel a manhattanite who now runs ted inc his own public relations firm the only problem was that as the promotion director it fell to me to organize the party so on my last day at the party as the guests thinned out to a last paltry few someone asked me why i was n't packing up and leaving the sad and pathetic answer was that i had to wait and pay the caterer
