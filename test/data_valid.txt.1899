it was big news in academe last winter when new york university bested harvard and lured niall ferguson the most widely discussed and controversial british historian of his generation away from oxford but recruiting superstars was nothing new for the university its strategy has been to achieve world class status by attracting a critical mass of top flight faculty an institution that was nearly bankrupt in the mid 1970 's has become the success story in higher education having mastered this frenzy of renown new york university now wants to change the rules of the game turning its prized collection of individual talents into citizens of the academic commonweal in a widely circulated report the university 's president john sexton has issued a summons to engagement it calls for the research faculty to spend more time with students inside and outside class engage with colleagues of differing views of expertise even hobnob with alumni and participate in admissions the university and academia in general will be better off if mr sexton can pull off this sea change a shift from me myself and i entrepreneurship to participation in a genuine community of scholars but unless other top rank schools decide improbably to declare a truce in the star wars his efforts are likely to fail in higher education as elsewhere competition not the congregation rules stealing luminaries from other universities has long been regarded as a sure fire way to climb the academic prestige ladder in recent years though such talent searches have become more commonplace and the offers have grown more outsized no one outside the world of education used to notice these comings and goings but now the news media have turned professors into luminaries it was big news in the business section of this newspaper when a few years back columbia offered the economist robert barro the sun and the moon and also carte blanche to hire five additional faculty members in a bid to lure him from harvard mr barro initially accepted the offer only to change his mind and remain in cambridge last year the cornel west soap opera made front pages around the country would the harvard professor and hip hop musician his intellectual prowess challenged and his pride wounded by harvard 's impolitic president decamp to princeton yes as mobility in the senior ranks of faculty members has increased so have the differences in compensation between the most sought after professors those whom mr sexton lauds as his blue team and the gray team everyone else trophy professors are wooed with outsized paychecks splendid housing travel allowances well endowed research centers brilliant colleagues and the promise that they 'll rarely encounter an undergraduate other striving universities among them rice georgia tech and george mason have gone on such star treks though with mixed success the newest combatant is the university of southern california in an explicit bid to become the next new york university it has created a war chest of 100 million to recruit 100 luminaries in just three years with a promise of more money and more star hires down the road already this attention grabbing move is heating up the bidding wars what 's good for a university 's reputation however is n't necessarily good for its students education since the standing of top rung professors their bankable asset depends on what they write not how they teach their main loyalty is n't to their students or their institution while mr sexton says he is determined to turn this trend around at new york university some recent initiatives there have reinforced this professorial narcissism take the university 's philosophy department in 1995 the department did n't even have a phd program just five years later it was rated as the top department in the web based publication the philosophical gourmet the philosophers version of the us news world report college ranking and the bible for prospective graduate students a bevy of star hires has elevated the department 's academic standing and with it the university 's but the new recruits have only modest teaching responsibilities especially in big undergraduate courses the burden of teaching falls on graduate student instructors and adjunct faculty higher education 's replaceable parts what 's more the newcomers are narrow gauge specialists whose intellectual insularity a disengagement from both the classroom and the common public sphere presents a formidable obstacle to the neighborliness that mr sexton now asks of his blue team if all big research universities were to pledge not to use lightened teaching loads as a bargaining chip a common enterprise university might stand a decent chance but that 's not how this blood sport is played new york university knows this very well barely six months after the university stole him from oxford niall ferguson accepted an offer from harvard which for more than a century has made the poaching of star professors an art form op ed contributor david l kirp professor of public policy at the university of california at berkeley is author of shakespeare einstein and the bottom line the marketing of higher education
