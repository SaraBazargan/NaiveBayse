on the wall in the library off the elegant rotunda of the stately brick garden city home of dale carnegie associates hangs a formal black and white portrait of the founder the rooms around the portrait house an international business that continues to run according to carnegie 's principles call people by their names be enthusiastic and do n't leave without asking for the sale carnegie began teaching public speaking in 1912 and since then over five million people around the world have signed up for the course and related programs most want one thing to graduate with better selling skills carnegie died in 1955 the training and consulting company he founded has stuck to the principles he set forth in books like how to win friends and influence people and the lesser known how to stop worrying and start living for decades the company has seen little need to modify his commandments under the firm control of the founder 's family the company has thrived by rejecting glitz and selling down home virtues like honesty integrity and the benefits of prayer less than a year after taking over as president and chief executive officer peter handal only the second chief executive not a part of the carnegie family has quietly begun the process of modernization hired initially as an independent productivity consultant mr handal a former apparel company owner with experience in real estate and other industries has quietly assumed the role of instrument of change in a company that until now has seen little need to do things differently quick to balance his embrace of the new with references to carnegie beliefs this is a company he pointed out where people still remember what mr carnegie said the 58 year old mr handal emphasizes that he is in no way ready to jettison the company 's core values he is however ready to try some new approaches to running a global business mr carnegie 's principles are still good he contended what 's changed is the world around us one of mr handal 's early decisions was a significant one to put the gracious corporate headquarters building up for sale and move administration into the company 's training center in hauppauge he has also tackled a number of longstanding growth impediments months of negotiations with the head of the company 's franchisee association produced a radically revised contract one that expanded the longstanding licensing agreement into a more marketable 15 year franchise contract for the first time franchisees could successfully apply to banks for loans there was more mr handal put curriculum development on the fast track and within months the company 's st louis based product development team had created new classes including one in negotiation he also asked for web based versions of the company 's courses a major cultural shift for a company that has always put primary emphasis on face to face communication recognizing that people are more hurried today mr handal also decided to repackage the company 's courses from their traditional spacing weekly 3 1 2 hour sessions that last for 12 weeks are now offered in many locations as three day seminars reflecting the way most business training is delivered today oddly perhaps for a company associated with salesmanship dale carnegie associates has traditionally done very little actual selling a more active direct sales program was tested this year in hauppauge where telemarketing helped raise sales 41 percent similar efforts will be rolled out in the company 's seven other corporate owned facilities around the country most dale carnegie offices are owned by franchisees which the company calls sponsors there are currently 160 offices in 75 countries franchisees are responsible for their own sales and marketing programs while dale carnegie continues to attract individuals to its public programs growth in recent years has come mainly from increased sales to corporations which hire instructors to offer customized programs on site computer associates the company 's biggest client on long island has contracted dale carnegie to do training both locally and worldwide the relationship began almost accidentally after a computer associates senior vice president jim tedesco took the introductory course on his own and became as he said a believer his classmates included a rabbi a microbiologist a sous chef a financial manager and a salesman we all came to realize that regardless of what our job was we were all selling something mr tedesco recalled the rabbi was selling his congregation on the lord 's commandments the sous chef was selling the executive chef on expanding the menu and being more creative the finance guy was selling his boss on a specific investment everybody was selling even though they did n't think in those terms by the end of the program everyone had gained the self confidence that according to the carnegie method is essential to successful selling the rabbi was telling biblical stories the sous chef was enthusiastic about a new menu the finance guy was able to communicate with more excitement mr tedesco said i realized that computer assciates had people all over the world who would benefit from this training and i brought them into the company to customize their program for us at mr tedesco 's initiative computer associates hired dale carnegie to create a customized version of its public speaking course that refers to situations common in the computer industry it is now made available to computer associates employees around the world at no cost to employees not everyone finds the dale carnegie approach relevant to doing business today brendan costello an account representative with tel net information systems in ronkonkoma said the course left him disappointed they teach you things like how to make the prospect feel more comfortable with you mr costello said i remember a lot of talk about going into someone 's office seeing a fish mounted on the wall and so you chat about fish with the prospect the focus on chitchat seemed misguided to mr costello in today 's world prospects expect you to know about their business realities and to be able to show how your product or service fits in he said there was too much talk about fish on the walls and not enough about doing business today looking back on his first year mr handal sees one of his first actions as particularly symbolic i saw the portrait of mr carnegie and he just looks so old fashioned so formal he said i realized we needed to make him seem more up to date an archive search turned up a more relaxed photograph of the founder one taken while he was duck hunting there 's mr carnegie looking rugged and easygoing and pretty modern said mr handal we cropped out the background and that 's the new portrait he added with a laugh he looks as if he just stepped out of an eddie bauer ad
