parents did not have to worry about sex on television in 1913 they might have worried a bit about sex in ballet in jeux vaslav nijinsky innovative choreographer as well as great dancer ruffled a few sensibilities mainly those of his composer debussy with a terse schematic ballet about a flirtatious love triangle the ruling metaphor was an implied game of tennis between a young man and two women with the women as attracted to each other as they were intermittently and ambiguously to the man musically and dramatically the climax was a triple kiss by all involved the choreography for jeux games was lost when serge diaghilev dropped it from his ballets russes the reasons are many but not surprising accounts of the period suggest that the ballet was overloaded with concepts nijinsky 's obsession with precision moving the trio into poses using half clenched fists and entangled arms was not necessarily at odds with the commissioned score as debussy thought but even leon bakst 's unconventional decor did not help create a theatrical impact in the nijinsky mystique a splendid program that the joffrey ballet of chicago presented here on thursday as part of an all too brief season at the kennedy center for the performing arts jeux has been placed in the context of revolutionary ballets choreographed by nijinsky the other two are l'apres midi d'un faune 1912 and le sacre du printemps from 1913 the novelty is this version of jeux previously staged in europe with choreography by millicent hodson based on research materials that were similar if less abundant than those available for her celebrated staging of sacre for the joffrey in 1987 a program note emphasizes the idea that the choreography is after nijinsky not directly his nonetheless this tantalizing triple bill says much about what all three works signify and also that yesterday 's scandal is not always today 's classic virtually none of nijinsky 's ballets survived in their original form with the possible exception of faune as the program proved the joffrey has persuasively maintained its familiar productions of faune originally performed in 1979 with rudolf nureyev and sacre the addition of jeux if only in an approximation of the original choreography completes a famous nijinsky triptych that broke theatrical taboos about expressing sexual desire aroused by a nymph who flees the faune plunges into an autoerotic release over her scarf at the end this act of simulated masturbation responsible for another uproar in 1912 was followed by a new and modern erotic image in jeux a menage a trois broke however obliquely a taboo about homosexual love in sacre the fertility ritual of a pagan tribe to appease the slavic sun god yarilo becomes an abstraction of the act of creation writing of their reconstruction of jeux for the royal ballet ms hodson and kenneth archer who reconstructed the bakst set see jeux as inspired by the bloomsbury painters and writers in england nonetheless pre revolutionary russia had its own sapphic salons and nijinsky contrary to common belief had already played tennis at home the decor however was supposedly based on an english house and is reproduced here as a flat structure rising up from sinister dark green foliage painted street lamps lighted to sharp blurred effect by kevin dreyer look down on circular flower beds on the floor around which the dancers weave the ballet has a legendary beginning a ball rolls on and the young man waving a tennis racket leaps in the production distances the audience from the original by giving the characters in the program the names of dancers who appeared in the 1913 premiere tamara karsavina was thus danced on thursday by deborah dawn ludmilla schollar by maia wilkins and vaslav nijinsky by willy shives the man has a red necktie white trousers and shirt the women with wavy hair are in white sweaters and narrow skirts as often written they rarely go on full pointe in their toe shoes this is not the most convincing of the hodson archer reconstructions there is too much getting in and out of positions but as usual they give us a sense of atmosphere that rings true as well as a context in which to place the action the young man is a voyeur who spies upon the two young women when the man dances with each woman in a social dance form is each woman jealous because he has taken away her lover or because she too is also attracted to the man the image is deliberately ambiguous jeux has been considered the first ballet on a modern theme certainly it paved the way for all the works about neurotic relationships that we see today what this projection suggests is that the real modernism of the ballet lay not only in its theme but also in the use of movement as heightened gesture that abstracts the essence of emotion this stylization becomes too literal when the idyll is broken up as another ball bounces on stage at the end the terrified dancers flee into the wings ms hodson sees this end as symbolic of the end of an era the prelude to world war i too much for a mere fling ms dawn and ms wilkins given a lot of wrist rotation and thigh beating had less conventional ballet steps than mr shives who certainly does not recall nijinsky in his pictures yet he can settle into sculptural poses his eyes deepening into his face the partner swapping contributes to some fast moving tension until the punch line kiss the women lean to kiss each other just as the man gets between them as for the familiar davis robertson had just the right mix of tense body alignment and animalistic fervor in his faune with an intense gaze the sacre remains ever brilliant in its patterns and symbolic logic the ensemble was superb and ms wilkins fabulous in every jump danced an electric and exhausting solo as the chosen one allan lewis conducted
