to the editor i was delighted to see the article as far as the eye can climb towering spots with history june 1 on towers in connecticut and the description of craig castle as an oversized chess rook i feel vindicated for something i said back in the 1930 's my father david stuart douglass was an architect who struggled through the depression he was sometimes grumpy having eight children in hard times may have helped that attitude and often chewed out the family he designed castle craig in meriden as one of his first projects in 1900 he was 20 years old born in wallingford studied at pratt institute in new york and moved from new york back to connecticut in the 1920 's to build a housing project for returning soldiers i was in the car with him and some of the rest of the family one day as he was driving to meriden we were on a road where you could see castle craig from the car and dad said i designed and supervised the building of castle craig i said looks just like the castle in the chess set he said what the hell do you know about anything so i shut up always a wise move on my part so i was very happy to see the article about towers and the description of the castle ruth c douglass west hartford
