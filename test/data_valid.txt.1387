last september a gloom and doom columnist warned about iraq if we 're going to invade we need to prepare for a worst case scenario involving street to street fighting ahem yes well that was my body double while i was on vacation since i complained vigorously about this war before it started it 's only fair for me to look back and acknowledge that many of the things that i along with other doves worried about did n't happen so let 's look back examine the record and offer some preliminary accountability despite my cassandra columns iraq never carried out terrorist attacks in the us or abroad it did n't use chemical or biological weapons and it did n't launch missiles against israel in hopes of triggering a broader war turkey has not invaded northern iraq to attack the kurds so let me start by tipping my hat to administration planners whose work reduced those risks for example one reason iraq did not attack israel may have been the special operations forces in the western desert of iraq where the launches would have come from and belated pressure from washington has kept turkey out of the war so far the most curious aspect of the war was iraq 's failure to use weapons of mass destruction and neither most doves nor most hawks get credit for predicting that if the us somehow blocked iraq from using them a deep bow to president bush but if iraq never had any weaponized chemical or biological agents then mr bush has plenty of explaining to do to the children of the americans and the iraqis who died in the war president bush in his state of the union address described a vast iraqi weapons program and talked about several mobile labs 30000 munitions 500 tons of chemical weapons 25000 liters of anthrax and 38000 liters of botulinum toxin these weapons were supposedly deployed in the war and controlled by field commands that we have long since overrun so where are they it 's too early to be sure but my guess is that doves cried wolf in terms of the risks of upheavals in pakistan and jordan indeed that alarm has been raised repeatedly at the time of the first gulf war again with the afghanistan war and now with the iraq war and the worries proved exaggerated each time true radicals came to power in parts of pakistan but on the whole the muslim street has not been as scary as we expected maybe it 's time to retire that bogeyman no one got the level of resistance quite right we doves correctly foresaw that the war would not be a cakewalk but for all our hand wringing there was never prolonged street to street fighting in baghdad the ones who really blew it were the superraptors like richard perle douglas feith and to a lesser extent paul wolfowitz who over the years had suggested as mr perle put it in a washington post essay in 1998 it would be neither wise nor necessary for us to send ground forces into iraq because iraqi exiles could do the job by themselves with american weapons and air cover fortunately tommy franks and colin powell demanded more than an invasion lite pipedream as for the reaction of the iraqi people i 'd say the doves were more accurate than the hawks frankly the reaction varied hugely there were some places where as vice president dick cheney had forecast our troops were greeted as liberators but even in the shiite south one feels as much menace as gratitude those americans who contend that iraqis hail us as liberators should try traveling around iraq i grew a mustache to look more like an iraqi so hostile locals would n't throw rocks at my car i 've now returned to the us and had to shave my mustache so my family would n't throw stones at me the hawks also look increasingly naive in their expectations that iraq will soon blossom into a pro american democracy for now the figures who inspire mass support in postwar iraq are shiite clerics like ali al sistani moderate but tainted by being soft on saddam moqtadah al sadr radical son of a martyr and muhammad bakr al hakim iran 's candidate all of whom criticize the united states as in revolutionary iran the shiite network is the major network left in iraq and it will help determine the narrative of the war infidel invasion or friendly liberation i 'm afraid we infidels had better look out op ed columnist e mail nicholas nytimescom
