a backyard pool is a sad sight in mid september even if a few warm days still lie ahead the pool is yesterday 's news halloween witches have already appeared in the local supermarket and the first christmas catalogs came in august but what do you do with a pool you ca n't hide it away in the garage like a barbecue or put it out for garbage collection like a broken lawn chair our pool owning friends ca n't decide whether it is more depressing to look at the cold empty water or at a big tarpaulin but they will have to decide soon because pool closing season is upon us this must be disappointing especially when so many pools stayed empty over labor day weekend because of the cold and rain in fact most pools do n't seem to be used very much even in the best summer we can always hear when our neighbors pools are in action apart from the splashing noises there are shouts and screams that are distinctive to pool use unlike any other sound uttered by suburbanites in everyday life a few people are in their pools every day but for most it seems to be just three or four hot weekends every season the rest of the time the pool just sits there quietly soaking up money at the rate of about 50 a week for maintenance plus electricity pool maintenance companies are only too happy to explain how the economy minded owner can do all the work himself they hand out free booklets and maintain web pages that show just how easy it is simply clean the skimmer baskets pump baskets and filters lay in a supply of chemicals like chlorine cyanuric acid bromine muriatic acid and many more compounds straight out of saddam hussein 's arsenal and do n't forget to shock your innocent pool regularly with massive chlorine doses you must worry about maintaining the right ph and keep the water moving with pumps so it does n't turn green at the end of a litany of tasks that would daunt hercules or even neptune the pool companies add the sly punchline if you would prefer to enjoy your summer call the pool professionals at 1 800 wet thru even the most frugal do it yourself pool owner ca n't avoid the expense of pumping unless he happens to have his own private power station when we disputed a bill with lipa a while ago the very first question they asked was have you put in a pool it seems that the first experience of every new pool owner is an electric shock not from the pumps but from the bills the pool owner 's life is a constant struggle against pollution cloudiness leaves dirt algae and other hazards like perfect health a sparkling pure blue pool is not easy to achieve and almost impossible to maintain doing it right is a full time job which is why pool maintenance is a major industry here like many of my generation i hate swimming pools apart from the embarrassment of displaying a body that is well past its sell by date and the pain of watching others do the same pools bring back unhappy childhood memories the physical education program at my school required swimming once a week every tuesday we were driven to the unheated public pool to be half drowned in chlorine exposed to horrible diseases and forced to dive from the high board into icy water it 's hard to remember which was worse standing in line for the board wet and shivering or plunging back into the water and finding it even colder than before all that has changed pools are fun now not a subtle form of torture families on long island began installing small pools as soon as the suburbs began to grow in the 1950 's they too had painful memories of public swimming pools and a backyard pool allows the family to avoid the beach and sea which is a public pool shared by all the peoples nations and industries of the world but at the end of the season a pool can not just be ignored it must be closed this is a huge operation comparable to mothballing in boeing 747 some owners drain out all the water typically four or five thousand gallons where does all that chemical rich water go closing must be done at exactly the right moment too early and you get an algae bloom in spring too late and you get a pool full of dead leaves the lengthy ceremony of closing ends with the installation of a cover which has to be strong enough to prevent well fed long islanders from falling right through one advertisement in a local paper for covers shows a baby elephant standing on the pool cover which may be exaggeration but it makes the point when i was a child i would come back from the compulsory dunkings in the public pool stricken with hypothermia and incipient pneumonia my mother would instantly put me into a nice hot bath when your backyard pool has been closed down even if it never opened there 's always a nice hot bath
