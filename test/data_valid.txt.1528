after passing an unfair and unaffordable tax cut last month congress ought to have gotten tax cuts out of its system for awhile but now with white house encouragement republican leaders are talking about enacting yet another round of tax bills that would use up what little is left of the federal surplus over the next 10 years squandering any chance at all of doing more for health education and the environment the proposed cuts would be attached to separate pieces of legislation raising the minimum wage and reforming health maintenance organizations in offering them lawmakers are setting a grotesque new standard for irresponsible budgeting the effort has been inspired partly by the delayed starts arbitrary expiration dates and other gimmicks used to disguise the earlier tax cut 's cost lawmakers are suddenly concerned that the voters will not see their taxes go down significantly for many years the patients bill of rights has been singled out as the first vehicle for the new cuts among them would be proposals to make it easier for americans to purchase health insurance a benefit that would accrue largely to upper income taxpayers who have already been showered with tax breaks in the first round of legislation a bill to raise the minimum wage is another possible vehicle especially for legislators who want to lower business and capital gains taxes senator phil gramm of texas and other republicans say that businesses need a tax break if they have to bear the cost of paying poor workers a decent wage but as senator edward kennedy points out the minimum wage has been raised many times over the years without also giving tax breaks to employers the arbitrary sunsetting of various portions of the tax bill a device used to make its cost seem lower is a special cause for concern among lawmakers the house majority leader dick armey of texas wants to push legislation to make the tax cut permanent he has it backward congress should rescind those parts of the tax cut that are to take effect years from now before the federal surplus is gone completely the estate tax repeal needs to be urgently reconsidered now that it has become clear that the states will lose as much as 100 billion because their own estate taxes are tied to the federal levy once americans realize the actual cost of the federal tax cut they may not be happy about it the original tax cut estimated to cost 135 trillion is actually closer to 18 trillion if the gimmicks are removed indeed new projections due later this summer are likely to show that the nation 's spending needs will force a raid on the social security and medicare trust funds to pay for regular spending in coming years for now the only benefit in the offing for taxpayers is the rebate of 300 for individuals and up to 600 for married couples that is to be sent out later this year in an unfortunate display of cheerleading the internal revenue service has been directed by the bush administration to send out 91 million letters telling taxpayers that thanks to president bush the check will soon be in the mail presumably no such letters will be going out to inform taxpayers of the harsh spending cuts that may be required to make room for the tax cut
