the rangers czech line forwards dominated their countryman who happens to be nicknamed the dominator last night but the rangers let another third period lead slip away and that disturbing tendency is something the rangers may have all summer to think about after games like last night 's 3 3 tie with the buffalo sabres at madison square garden the rangers entered the third period with a 3 1 lead over buffalo and its star czech goalie dominik hasek thanks to their czech line of jan hlavac petr nedved and radek dvorak but michael peca the sabres captain scored at 7 minutes 31 seconds of the third to turn up the pressure and when curtis brown was credited with a power play goal with 3 11 left in regulation off a centering pass from behind the goal line that bounced off goalie mike richter then eric lacroix then in the sabres had salvaged a point with each team having 17 regular season games left the rangers lead the sabres by 1 point in the eastern conference standing for the eighth and final postseason berth there is nothing you can do about a bad break like that rangers coach john muckler said referring to brown 's pinball like game tying goal we got a point we ca n't look back at what happened or what bad breaks we got that 's the way things go we 'll get a break somewhere but with the surging montreal canadiens and the resilient carolina hurricanes also in the hunt will it be too late the rangers could have used a break last night with john maclean in the penalty box for his inadvertent high stick to jay mckee 's face lacroix said he never saw brown 's goal i did n't even feel anything lacroix said it 's not like i kicked it in richter said eric was in the right spot and it just hit him in the right spot the wrong spot as far as the rangers were concerned the sabres comeback negated a two goal performance from jan hlavac petr nedved forced turnovers that led to both scores when asked later if it took three czechs ganging up on a fellow countryman in hasek nedved laughed i do n't know about that nedved said but the last two games it worked on friday nedved scored a hat trick in buffalo to lead the rangers to a 6 3 victory last night it was hlavac 's turn to shine hlavac who has 13 goals in his last 23 games has 17 goals on the season the rangers meanwhile have now scored eight goals in their last two games against hasek nedved 's third on friday was into an empty net before friday hasek was 7 0 3 in his previous 10 starts against the rangers shutting them out five of the last seven times he had started against them that of course was before the czech line in the 27 games since muckler formed the line on jan 5 it has combined for 37 goals and 45 assists for 82 points last night however the rangers received a jump start from someone else their captain brian leetch playing what muckler called his best game since his return from a broken forearm leetch set up adam graves for the rangers first goal the rangers second goal was from hlavac off a pretty nedved setup nedved knocked the puck up ice then retrieved it in the neutral zone before skating in with hlavac on a 2 on 1 with james patrick skating back nedved 's circle to circle pass from right wing was perfectly timed hlavac one timed the puck inside the left post beating hasek as he slid across the crease at 13 01 of the second giving the rangers a 2 1 lead hlavac made it 3 1 at 15 28 after nedved had pressured aleksei zhitnik into a mistake behind his own net and still the rangers came up short the most frustrating part for me is that i have n't scored a big goal all year said theo fleury who had nothing to show for his game high four shots on goal no matter how hard i try or what i do the puck just wo n't go in when it should because i 'm doing everything right a break or two would n't hurt slap shots neil bruntrager a st louis lawyer who represents kevin stevens was at the garden last night after meeting with stevens earlier in the day stevens who was arrested in a st louis suburb on jan 23 and charged with possession of crack cocaine is participating in an outpatient rehabilitation program in the metropolitan area bruntrager said that his defense would be built around the argument that stevens was set up bruntrager said he would argue that a prostitute and an accomplice and not the police had set up stevens a preliminary hearing is set for march 23 adam graves and his wife violet were honored before the game graves was recently awarded 25000 from the nhl for his commitment to community causes the rangers matched the award the graveses plan to donate the money to the neonatal intensive care unit of the white plains hospital center their son jaxon born premature died last month
