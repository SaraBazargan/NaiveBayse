it looked bad for the mets after their first loss yesterday to the milwaukee brewers after the second defeat things looked much worse not only did the mets lose both games of a doubleheader 8 7 and 5 3 before 19048 fans at shea stadium but they also lost their prize pitcher 37 year old tom glavine to an inflamed elbow on his pitching arm it was not immediately clear if glavine who exited in the second inning after surrendering five runs would be able to make his next start he may have to miss a start said art howe the mets manager if that 's what it takes to get this thing resolved that 's what it takes we ca n't have him go down glavine who has never been on the disabled list in his long distinguished career said he has no such plans i 've had some problems with my shoulder before but generally never with my elbow said glavine who added that he had never missed a start because of injury since becoming a starting pitcher in the major leagues in 1987 it concerns me and worries me a little bit because i do n't have anything to base it on i 'll get with the doctors tomorrow and we 'll go from there going on the disabled list is not an option i 'll take it day by day and maybe i can make my next start glavine said that tests before this season showed he had bone spurs in the left elbow but that it did not bother him until he pitched in a game in denver that was the first sign of discomfort he said adding that he aggravated the injury by pitching with a blister on his finger in atlanta on may 23 and overcompensating for that it 's been a problem for a while and i did n't feel well all week long glavine said there was no way i was n't going to start tonight i wanted to go out there and test it and see what i could do it is difficult for me to extend and throw the ball down and that 's what i need when i was warming up before the game i tried to get the ball down and it would bite i knew as early as yesterday that today was going to be a tough day for me glavine 5 6 allowed four runs in the first inning and another in the second before departing it was the shortest outing for glavine since a game he pitched for the atlanta braves in may 1989 against the chicago cubs the mets began the season with baseball 's oldest roster and they have been beset by injuries in particular to older players as the season has progressed david cone recently retired because of an arthitic hip mo vaughn may never play again because of an arthritic knee pedro astacio may face season ending surgery on his shoulder and the team 's biggest star catcher mike piazza may not play again this season either because of a torn groin muscle and now the mets must worry about glavine a future hall of famer who was the mets major off season acquisition leaving the braves and signing a 35 million deal for three years after being courted directly by the mets owner fred wilpon although the mets have struggled all season glavine had pitched relatively well until his two previous starts both against the braves the mets can only hope that glavine recovers quickly and can forget last night 's game in which he was shelled almost as badly as steve trachsel the mets starter in the first game was the power displayed by the brewers in the opener was more befitting a first place team than the last place one they are the brewers scored a run in the first inning and two more in the third the mets exploded for four runs in the fourth no problem for the brewers they got four more in the top of the fifth another in the seventh and held off the mets in the ninth inning for the victory eric young and geoff jenkins each hit a solo home run in milwaukee 's half of the third inning royce clayton hit another solo shot in the fourth inning and richie sexson clobbered a two run 420 foot shot directly over the center field wall also in the fourth all four home runs were allowed by trachsel who was so sick after the game from flu like symptoms that he could not meet with reporters trachsel 4 3 took the loss a 10 hit 7 run affair in which he lasted just four innings in part because of his illness but moreso because he was stung and tattooed howe said traschel just did n't have it today when he came out of the game he looked a little ill maybe the flu bug it just was n't his day ty wigginton gave the mets much of their offense in the opener with a three hit game that included a two run triple a solo home run and a single wigginton hit another home run in the second game and added three more runs batted in that was the good news on an unhappy day at shea inside pitch tony clark changed his number from 00 to 52 for the rest of the season after visiting a queens school this week he said and being peppered with questions from the students about why he is wearing mr met 's number mr met was here long before i came and he 'll be here long after i leave clark said i got the message from the kids that giving up the number was the thing to do
