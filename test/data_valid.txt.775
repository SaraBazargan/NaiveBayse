it 's one of pro football 's oldest tenets dependable special teams make teams dependable just as vulnerable special teams make teams vulnerable no team is more aware of that tenet than the giants whose special teams yesterday made five mistakes in the second quarter that shaped the 31 21 loss to the lions and stirred coach jim fassel 's temper this fassel said of the special teams is about as worse as i have seen in my whole career playing coaching or anything that i have ever watched or anything that 77897 giants parishioners have ever watched it is n't often that a pro football game is lost in the second quarter but yesterday 's game was the punt coverage team let desmond howard the well traveled punt return and kickoff return specialist scoot 50 yards to the giants 28 yard line to set up the lions second touchdown the punt coverage team let howard scoot 30 yards to the giants 29 after greg comella 's holding penalty had erased the coverage that pinned howard at the lions 39 a 32 yard difference bashir levingston 's holding penalty wiped out tiki barber 's 67 yard punt return to the lions 18 brad maynard 's punt was blocked by larry foster and recovered by cory schlesinger at the giants 8 setting up the lions third touchdown on the ensuing kickoff levingston 's fumble was recovered by the barrett green at the giants 36 those mistakes dropped the giants into a 21 0 hole that they were never able to climb out of and now the giants who play in arizona next sunday night and then in washington must climb out of a two game losing streak that has jeopardized their journey to the playoffs to boost that climb look for fassel to make some changes on the special teams especially the punt coverage and kickoff coverage units i am going to look at it the coach said referring to the special teams play and then i am going to make a decision but i will replace guys would fassel go so far as to replace larry mac duff the giants special teams coach throughout fassel 's four seasons as head coach with five games remaining no fassel replied bluntly the coach did n't cover the kicks the coach did n't fumble the ball after the game pat hanlon the giants vice president for communications was asked to inform mac duff that reporters wanted to interview him about the special teams mistakes half an hour later hanlon was asked if mac duff was available i 've not seen him hanlon said mac duff a teammate of fassel 's at fullerton college in california and a longtime college assistant coach before fassel hired him in 1997 has apparently not inspired the giants special teams after comella 's holding penalty maynard 's punt had howard pinned near the sideline it comes down 3 or 4 yards from the sideline maynard said later but nobody 's there that 's when howard scooted 30 yards through the punt coverage team to the giants 29 sometimes you wonder where the guys hearts are maynard said if you were in some of our special teams meetings you would n't believe some of the stuff guys laughing and joking it 's easy for me to say this but you wonder do the other guys on the other teams want it more i do n't know the answer we 're all supposed to come to work prepared i 'll stick up for larry on this he tries to coach everybody in the meetings and he stays up and watches more film than everybody but when maynard was asked if the giants players respected mac duff as a special teams coach he said i do n't get into that i 'm here to kick the ball by not wanting to answer that question maynard answered it if special teams players do n't respect their special teams coach it 's like kids who do n't respect their teacher they 're not going to study they 're not going to get good marks special teams coaches are a special breed two of the best are joe avezzano of the cowboys and mike sweatman of the jets to be successful a special teams coach must be a hard tough coach because he 's demanding hard tough work when it was mentioned to lomas brown a seven time pro bowl offensive tackle who was signed to be a locker room leader that fassel might tinker with the special teams now he sneered we have to do more than tinker brown said maybe we need more veterans on those teams we ca n't be playing on a short field like we have we 're in dire straits and we need to get this stuff fixed all year long we 've been counting on our special teams and they have n't come through for us and if those special teams do n't come through in the five remaining games this giants season wo n't be so special
