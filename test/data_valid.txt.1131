slavko vranes and the knicks agree that he may need years of work before he can contribute but the knicks who have tried to bring european talent to the nba in the past and failed are still set to bring vranes to new york to stay the knicks who left boston on saturday night for utah and another week of summer league in the reebok rocky mountain revue expect to complete the buyout of vranes 's contract from buducnost his team in serbia and montenegro in the next few days vranes was drafted last month with the 39th pick over all and comes to the nba with slight expectations center maciej lampe was drafted only nine spots higher but his every move has been scrutinized for vranes a 20 year old center who measures 7 feet 6 inches the learning will come at the end of the knicks bench rather than from a faraway land i think it 's great for him to be over here instead of europe because we play a different type of basketball knicks coach don chaney said not to discredit european basketball but the nba game is the best in the world there is a physical presence over here in the first week of summer league vranes showed a soft touch on offense but was far too soft on defense and on the boards where the knicks want him to contribute but they are willing to be patient if he 's ready in a year we 'll take it chaney said but he really has to learn the game the good thing is he 's young and he 's willing vranes who speaks english said i 'd rather stay here and work hard with coach it 's best to try to stay i will work more here i know i must work more because last season i did n't play much with my country vranes played sparingly last year in the euroleague averaging less than a point a game after the knicks first three games in the summer league in boston vranes lifted weights and found a gym elsewhere in the city to practice with the exception of his defense the payoff came quickly after going through his first two games without a field goal vranes converted 9 of 13 shots in the final four games the game is interesting here vranes said the players are much more physical they come in and hit you and i 'm trying to learn the plays where to be and what to do while i am being hit but i am here and i am ready for work for the knicks having vranes and lampe in camp was a step forward in 1999 the knicks took frederic weis a 7 2 center from france with the 15th pick he made a brief visit to a summer league but never came back last year the knicks drafted milos vujanic in the second round and while he has become heralded as the best point guard in europe he has never attended the knicks summer camp and will remain overseas for at least one more year from the start the knicks have maintained that this year 's international rookies will be part of the roster this season vranes 's deal appears easier to complete with a small buyout lampe has been working to reduce his buyout worth about 2 million from real madrid we 'd certainly like to work with these guys sooner rather than later general manager scott layden said
