when terrorists attacked the world trade center most people nearby fled down stairs and uptown but joseph lombardi did the opposite despite injuring his leg in the tumult he headed to liberty tower on nassau street one block from ground zero and took an elevator to his penthouse apartment on the 29th floor it was like a captain going to be with his ship explained mr lombardi 60 a restoration architect who had bought and renovated the building in 1978 helping to pioneer the residential development of lower manhattan after billowing soot and ash blacked out his floor to ceiling windows he felt liberty tower sway and realized that the trade center had collapsed nevertheless mr lombardi who is divorced with two grown children remained for several days the only person in his building to some extent i felt like a guardian he said with no phone he lived off dried fruit and canned tuna sleeping with a wet mask over his mouth because the apartment was filled with smoke mr lombardi is still there among the more extreme examples of the high rise dwelling new yorker who is defiantly not succumbing to an expected wave of post attack acrophobia new yorkers may be a breed apart it 's probably social i have a view and other people do n't the author tom wolfe said some of the tallest residential buildings the 72 story trump world plaza near the united nations the 70 story random house park imperial at 55th street and broadway and matching 80 story towers at columbus circle are still going up the columbus circle towers called 1 central park will include a hotel and the headquarters for aol time warner the upper floors will be condominiums brokers say that none of the parallels to the world trade center corporate symbol twin towers unusual height seem to be giving buyers pause of 200 million in sales since august more than 46 million changed hands after sept 11 we have n't really had any fallout said louise sunshine chairman of the sunshine group people buy high rise because they want views and the terrorist attack is not having an effect on people who want to live like that before the attacks one buyer a banker who works in midtown chose a 3500 square foot duplex penthouse afterward dolly lenz executive vice president of douglas elliman asked him if he wanted to look at something else and he said absolutely not he was n't going to let them mess up his life she said he signed the contract in the wake of the disintegration of the city 's two tallest buildings exposed upper floor apartments might be expected to lose some of their real estate cachet and in fact long planned buildings aside it may be some time before big buildings become fashionable again people are n't going to say 'let 's build a headquarters and make it low and squat said david childs of skidmore owings merrill who designed 1 central park but i do n't think we 'll see 100 stories for a while maybe never on monday the council on tall buildings and urban habitat held a conference in chicago where architects and owners agreed that the real issue is air safety not building codes the council 's chairman ron klemencic acknowledged that iconic here i am buildings are less likely to go up in the next decade or two but said he thinks the reasons run deeper than engineering we 'll still build tall buildings beautiful inspirational eye catching he said but they wo n't be reaching to the 120 to 130 story range mainly because of psychology we can build them but the question is will you go into them one woman who lives in a twin tower style building on west end avenue said she still felt comfortable standing on her 39th floor balcony even though her 5 year old son asked do you think that when a plane is flying over our building they 'll recognize it as the twin towers and crash into it dr william sanderson director of the cognitive behavioral treatment program for anxiety and depression at rutgers university said many new yorkers were more anxious about working in a high rise than living in one he was consulted by a company that was forced to abandon its 30th floor offices near the trade center and employees were so distraught that the company found temporary quarters on the second and third floor of another building after a traumatic event he said people tend to become fearful of anything that resembles the initial trauma and one of the most salient experiences for many is thinking about how long it took people to get out of the twin towers they 're highly conscious during the day of being in the same situation he said adding even if you see it as an isolated event planes do n't crash into buildings every day you want to avoid any approximation of that for many residents of high rises the issue is n't height but proximity to ground zero especially if they were nearby at the time of the attacks or to a location that seems like a possible target for other terrorist attacks dr sanderson said people who worked near the empire state building for example have said they fear it will be attacked too but the dangers of high rise living like other facts of urban life that might cow out of towners earned little more than a shrug from many new yorkers i always watched airplanes go by and did n't think it was safe said allen beeber a businessman who lives on the 46th floor of the millennium tower on the upper west side but he said he thinks it unlikely that terrorists will try the same kind of attack again because the element of surprise has been eliminated and he has concluded that there 's more risk in crossing 42nd street than living up high as for worries about getting out he said there are plenty of fire stairwells phyllis newman who lives on the 19th floor of one of the city 's older twin towers with a terrace overlooking central park said the main difference in her attitude these days is an awareness that during a power blackout it 's a long walk down and the stairs would be dark so she now keeps an emergency kit near her bed with a flashlight water a blanket diet coke and a transistor radio dr sanderson said it usually takes about three months for people to recover from a trauma like sept 11 barring other events if a person is the victim of a sexual assault he said there are things they can do to decrease the likelihood of it happening again in this situation people are uncertain what they can do to protect themselves which is why terrorism works in a sense because it 's unpredictable but for people like mr lombardi there are certainties that offset all that i would n't want to be stopped from the pleasure the empowerment even the aggressiveness of living in a high rise he said after living there 20 years there is n't a sunrise or sunset that does n't impress me that i do n't think actively about being high above the fray even turns out to be strangely comforting when i walk back from my office in tribeca down to my apartment mr lombardi said that sense of despair comes back the real horror was in the streets but when i 'm in my apartment i 'm actually fine
