the feverish second half rally means nothing in terms of the bottom line the knicks still lost last night 102 97 to the milwaukee bucks at madison square garden but the knicks inspired play though it was not even two quarters worth of good basketball may have saved don chaney from being replaced as coach after only five weeks at the helm led by allan houston 's career high 44 points 24 of them in the fourth quarter the knicks chopped a 24 point third quarter deficit to 8 points in the third quarter and to 2 in the game 's final seconds while the knicks still lost it was the type of rally that showed that the players had not become completely lackadaisical under chaney 's laid back leadership when the knicks left dallas after being walloped 111 89 by the mavericks on thursday night one had to wonder whether chaney could survive a second straight no show as it is the knicks 14 22 have still lost five consecutive games something they never did in six plus seasons under jeff van gundy the last time the knicks lost five straight was in the 1995 1996 season don nelson was fired as coach shortly thereafter but his termination was because of his rocky relationship with patrick ewing not his record the knicks who dropped eight games under 500 for the first time since the 1990 1991 season said last night 's comeback meant little but when latrell sprewell added a vote of confidence for chaney who is 4 13 as knicks coach it had more resonance because of the late rally sprewell took issue with the remarks of charles barkley the tnt analyst and former star who said after thursday 's game that the knicks were embarrassing and had quit on their coach that was a ludicrous statement because we 've been in every game except new jersey here and the dallas game said sprewell who struggled for the fifth straight game scoring only 13 points and shooting 5 of 18 in every other game we had a legitimate shot at winning if not just blowing the game no one on this team has quit on coach we 're behind him not only that but guys have personal pride and want to win and we know he wants to win for the first 30 minutes last night it certainly looked as if the knicks had lost their way under chaney with ray allen 37 points hitting four of his eight 3 pointers tying a franchise record and outscoring the knicks by himself 16 12 the knicks fell behind by 16 points in the first quarter they trailed by 49 34 at halftime and by 64 40 with 6 minutes 33 seconds left in the third quarter the sluggish start was baffling the knicks losers of seven of their last eight games had every reason to be fired up milwaukee had played the night before and were without their leading scorer glenn robinson who was out with a bruised left thigh we just continued to encourage each other said houston who made 13 of 29 shots and scored 29 points in the second half when you do that eventually you 'll turn it around it was a driving dunk by marcus camby 11 points 8 rebounds that got the knicks going sparking a 20 4 run that sliced the deficit to 68 60 in just over four minutes the rally seemed short lived when milwaukee pushed the lead to 84 70 on two ferocious dunks by darvin ham with 8 52 left in the game but with sprewell on the bench for five minutes houston scored 12 straight points before kurt thomas hit a short jumper to pull the knicks within 2 86 84 with 3 36 remaining anthony mason answered with a basket but houston kept the knicks 3 points behind with a free throw milwaukee seemed to put it away by scoring the next 6 points but jackson hit a 3 pointer and houston made a three point play and then nailed a 3 pointer to cut the bucks lead to 97 94 with 274 seconds left after sam cassell 24 points hit two free throws houston hit another 3 pointer to make it 99 97 with 20 seconds left allen made two free throws four seconds later and othella harrington missed a desperation 3 pointer on the knicks last possession houston derived no joy from his individual effort it just feels like another game honestly houston said it would 've been much more enjoyable if we would 've won the next time i have a career high hopefully it 'll be in a win mark jackson had 15 points and 11 assists and said the rally in which the knicks outscored milwaukee by 57 38 over the final 18 minutes could be the start of something good the second half was a thing of beauty he added if we win the next game and play hard continue with that type of energy and effort then yes it means something but if not then it 's the same old story chaney seeing only another loss did not even go that far i think our confidence level is down tremendously he said i think the losses are starting to hit home with us rebounds clarence weatherspoon missed his 23rd straight game last night with a partially torn tendon in his right foot but was cleared to return to practice today he might be activated for the knicks next game wednesday at boston travis knight has a torn lateral meniscus in his right knee and was placed on the injured list knight will have a second opinion to determine whether he will have arthroscopic surgery which would keep him out six weeks the knicks activated larry robinson a 6 3 guard who had been on the injured list with tendinitis in his right knee latrell sprewell set a franchise record by hitting three free throws to push his consecutive free throw streak to 37 kiki vandeweghe had held the record with 34
