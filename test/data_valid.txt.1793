thomas e white the army secretary and a former top executive for the enron corporation told a senate committee today that he was unaware of any efforts by enron to manipulate energy prices in the california power crisis of 2000 and 2001 but in heated exchanges with mr white democrats on the panel said they doubted his credibility and they called on the federal energy regulatory commission and the securities and exchange commission to investigate his role in the energy crisis and his sale of millions of dollars in enron stock last year there is substantial evidence that mr white misled investors said senator ron wyden democrat of oregon what especially troubles me is that i do n't see any evidence to date that these actions are being timely and thoroughly investigated by this administration 's regulators mr white who was vice chairman of enron energy services before becoming army secretary is the most senior member of the bush administration to have worked for enron and his 11 year tenure at the company has come under intense scrutiny by democrats today 's appearance was mr white 's first sworn testimony before congress concerning the enron scandal california energy regulators contend that enron engaged in sham transactions in late 2000 that drove up electricity prices and deepened the energy crisis in the west the regulators have said that enron energy services was one of several enron divisions that participated in the phony transactions for two hours today five democrats on the senate commerce science and transportation committee peppered mr white with questions about his knowledge of the california transactions they also asked about numerous contacts 77 in all he had with former enron colleagues after becoming army secretary in may 2001 the accounting practices at his former company and his use of army jets for personal trips only two republicans appeared at the hearing and they offered mr white little support an indication of the political power that the issue of corporate malfeasance holds just now but mr white his knees bouncing nervously under the committee 's oak table vigorously defended himself saying he was ashamed about revelations of improprieties at enron while also insisting that he played no part in any wrongdoing while i was employed in the private sector i carried out my responsibilities in an entirely ethical manner just as i did over the 28 years that i served my country in the united states army mr white a west point graduate and retired brigadier general said in his opening statement at the heart of the democrats attack was what senator byron l dorgan democrat of north dakota called smoking gun evidence of wrongdoing enron memorandums released by california regulators in may that outlined strategies to inflate prices artificially in california 's deregulated energy market at least one of those documents mentioned enron energy services and mr dorgan seized on that fact to allege a conspiracy to drive up prices in california involving mr white 's former division and enron 's energy traders the scheme of fat boy could not possibly work without ees mr dorgan said using the code name for one of the strategies when mr white denied having had any prior knowledge of fat boy or the other trading strategies mr dorgan fired back you 're all kissing cousins here you 're under the same corporate umbrella mr white replied that enron energy services maintained an arm 's length relationship with the wholesale division which he said developed fat boy and the other strategies when we had our profit and our numbers and our targets to make and the wholesale group had separate targets to make we were not kissing cousins mr white said the secretary also exchanged sharp words with senator barbara boxer democrat of california who raised questions about telephone calls mr white made to friends and former colleagues at enron at the same time that he was selling 3 million in enron stock last fall calling all those insider people it just does n't look right ms boxer said just like it does n't look right for martha stewart mr white said the calls were personal and he objected to ms boxer 's suggestions that he was spending too much time making phone calls to friends while the country was at war i never said you did n't work hard to prosecute the war she said mr white shot back well yes you did after the hearing ms boxer sent a letter to mr white saying she found his answers evasive deceptive argumentative and not helpful in any way senator max cleland a democrat from georgia who was a decorated army captain in vietnam chided mr white for earning more than 12 million on enron stock sales last year when small time investors and low level employees were losing their savings in combat officers eat last mr cleland said in the economic turmoil the economic warfare that they faced enron officers ate first mr white said that he was required to sell his stock under government ethics rules and that he also suffered financially when the stock 's price plummeted last fall he said he returned options for 665000 enron shares in january after they had become worthless i am ashamed of what 's happened to that corporation mr white said
