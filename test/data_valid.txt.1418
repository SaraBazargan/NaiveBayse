alfonso soriano took one of his majestic swings to start tonight 's game the bat rifling through the strike zone and eventually tilting toward the sky and the baseball landing in the left field seats soriano repeated this pretty scene in the second inning producing a three run home run the cleveland indians were worried about seeing soriano do this again and maybe even again after that soriano did not hit another homer but it did not matter because the yankees joined him in the 14 5 mugging of the indians at a subdued jacobs field jorge posada blasted a grand slam and tied his career high with six runs batted in every yankees starter managed at least one hit by the third inning and the yankees had one sequence in which nine consecutive batters reached base david wells after a scolding from manager joe torre slogged through seven innings to get the victory but it was soriano who got the yankees churning time and again soriano is tied with jason giambi for the team lead with 22 homers he is tied with seattle 's ichiro suzuki for the american league lead with 23 stolen bases and he leads the league in total bases no player has led the league in steals and total bases in 57 years we always have fun with him posada said he 's our mvp no doubt torre was more emphatic than posada calling soriano one of the leading candidates for the league 's most valuable player award because he contributes with offense defense and his personality i know when i go onto the field a lot of the fans call me the mvp soriano said i know there are a lot of good players here and around the league soriano mentioned giambi alex rodriguez derek jeter nomar garciaparra and bernie williams before adding when people call me the mvp i 'm very excited the only thing missing from this massacre were aluminum bats beer bellies and a keg behind second base wells 10 5 had an 8 0 lead after one and a half innings it should have been easy but wells briefly made it trying the sluggish approach of wells who surrendered three runs in the second inning caused torre to visit the mound after cleveland scored another run in the third the yankees had a nine run lead and posada said torre delivered a stern message to wells i knew it was n't going to be pretty posada said both torre and wells tried to play down the meeting but it was obvious that the manager was unhappy torre said i just wanted to go out but torre normally leaves the dugout only to make a change wells initially refused to comment on torre 's visit but then he described the manager 's reason for the conference as a pep talk mike thurman began warming up after torre 's trip to the mound the situation was similar to a game in may 1998 when wells had a 9 0 lead against the texas rangers and torre felt that his pitcher had quit on the yankees wells later told torre that he disliked it when the manager called the bullpen too early and torre told him he would not do it again if wells agreed to work hard for nine innings after tonight 's chat wells recorded nine straight outs and stifled the indians on one run in the next four and two thirds innings he allowed four earned runs as torre let wells unleash 117 pitches a full night 's work when wells was asked if he needed a visit from torre in the third he said i did n't see him coming wells added that posada was pivotal in his turnaround because posada noticed that wells was arching his back during his delivery causing his pitches to be high in the strike zone joe got on him i got on him posada said when you have a lead like that sometimes it 's good sometimes it 's not soriano slugged the second pitch from ryan drese 8 7 an estimated 421 feet for his seventh leadoff homer and then ripped an 0 2 breaking ball for a three run shot during a seven run second inning the only other yankee with more leadoff homers was rickey henderson soriano 's idol who had nine in 1986 posada had a two run double in the second off jake westbrook who made his season debut and lined his fifth grand slam off westbrook in the third to put the yankees ahead by 10 runs still it was soriano 's show it 's amazing what he does wells said about soriano he 's becoming that much more valuable and dangerous inside pitch mike thurman who was recalled from class aaa columbus to replace roger clemens on the roster pitched two scoreless innings saturday night thurman tossed 15 1 3 scoreless innings and was named the international league pitcher of the week
