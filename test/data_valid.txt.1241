one by one the sailors came ambling down the docks by the hudson river young and not so young some in flashy sea boots and others in tired sneakers they were an eclectic bunch the fellow with the guitar case strapped across his back seemed particularly ready for anything this disparate group shared a common interest as on most weekend afternoons since last november they gathered on an unseasonably warm saturday two weeks ago for a day of sailboat racing in the forefront of the manhattan skyline the current there rips right along and the fluctuating wind can be a handful but it is hard to imagine a more dramatic site competition in the winter frostbite series whose host is the new york city community sailing association concludes saturday from maryland to maine similar frostbite programs keep hard core racers happy and active during the inactive months in nippy locales this year however the title has been a misnomer frostbite said winifred ormand a long island native and copy editor who is in second place in the season standing it 's been more like heatstroke sailing this winter it is tempting to accuse ormand of hyperbole but not after hearing tales of previous years when hulls had to be hacked free from ice for a day of sailing or when racing was canceled because of the car size floes drifting down the river that said the odd northerly gale has at times kept the six boat fleet of olympic class solings dockbound for the most part it 's been pretty mild said bob roistacher the association 's chairman and race director we have n't been iced out or snowed out but we have been blown out a literary agent who has been sailing on and off his entire life roistacher is the heart and soul of the organization and he is clearly a man for all seasons i do n't know what keeps him going said the brooklyn based racer ed ross who runs a petroleum distribution business but i really respect and appreciate him in the winter roistacher is a hands on one man race committee on a good day he will reel off 9 or 10 short races from a small powerboat bobbing on the bouncy water in fairer weather he oversees the association 's beginning and intermediate sailing schools as well as the spring summer and fall racing series the 250 annual membership fee the education and racing programs cost extra also allows members access to the solings for recreational day sailing information is available at 212 222 1405 or at the web site wwwsailnyorg roistacher says his motivation is straightforward on the one hand he realizes new york is a waterfront community where there is limited access to the water a situation his civic minded side wishes to address there are grass roots efforts by people like me all over the city who want to make the waterfront more accessible he said the sailor in him focuses on a logical means to that end the point is to get people to sail who might not otherwise he said roistacher has lowered or even waived membership fees to those who could not afford the full rate founded in 1996 at the 79th street boat basin the association has recently moored its boats on the north side of manhattan 's battery park city at pier 25 when barges were brought into the area to clear debris after sept 11 the association found dock space at the port imperial marina in weehawken nj which has served as the base for this winter 's frostbite series roistacher hopes to return to pier 25 later this spring from wherever they set forth the sailors in the association seem to have established a refreshing no pretense zone the goal is to improve one 's skill level and have fun ross said aboard the three person solings crews rotate positions after every race so everyone has a chance to steer trim sails and help with the tactics when i visited the group two weeks ago the light morning southerly breeze continued building until it topped off at a solid 20 plus knots with the occasional gust hitting 30 the day 's racing was called off but with ormond and ross itching to go for a sail i boarded one of the solings with them for a fresh couple of hours reaching hard back and forth across the hudson in the shadow of the skyscrapers with a reef in the main and more than capable boat mates the ride was fast and exhilarating on our final tack as it has before it occurred to me that there is no better way to see manhattan than from the cockpit of a small boat under sail later i mentioned that to roistacher of course i was preaching to the choir 's master the boating report herb mccormick is the editor of cruising world magazine
