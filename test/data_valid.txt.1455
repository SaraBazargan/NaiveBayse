roger clemens did not lose over a span of 127 days this season the team with baseball 's worst record has beaten him twice in the last 11 days the tampa bay devil rays seized on clemens 's struggles with his split finger fastball tonight and beat the yankees 8 4 clemens 's regular season record fell to 20 3 and the late season losses can not tarnish his summer 's work but there has been an erosion of his dominance lately and his next start will come in the yankees first playoff game against oakland on wednesday if clemens had won or if he did not get a decision in this game he would have finished with the highest winning percentage for any 20 game winner in history instead clemens ends the year with an 870 percentage the same percentage david cone had with the mets in 1988 ron guidry 's record of 893 when he was 25 3 for the 1978 yankees still stands clemens allowed five runs four earned in five innings but he mentioned to the pitching coach mel stottlemyre that he felt much better than in previous starts much stronger an encouraging sign at this time of the year i felt more fluid and my arm was n't heavy clemens said my arm 's got much more life manager joe torre smiled when asked about the recent losses and remarked that clemens had spoiled everybody with his incredible season now 39 years old clemens passed bob feller jim palmer red ruffing and five others in career victories he has 280 career victories within clear range of 300 clemens set the american league career record for strikeouts on the first day of the season before the end of the summer he passed gaylord perry don sutton tom seaver and bert blyleven only nolan ryan and steve carlton have more strikeouts clemens had two starts with 10 or more strikeouts the 97th and 98th of his career and he passed sandy koufax in that category moving into third place clemens struck out 213 this year the second most in the league he made 33 starts never throwing fewer than five innings in any of them and pitched 220 1 3 innings after tonight 's games he is one of three pitchers in the american league to win 20 or more games this year one is seattle 's jamie moyer and the other is mark mulder against whom clemens will pitch in the playoffs wednesday clemens started the all star game for his league his first all star start since 1986 the 15 year span between starts is the longest ever he won 16 consecutive decisions the longest streak in yankees history if clemens wins the cy young award it will be his sixth but these are the yankees and the playoffs are always the most important part of the whole clemens has had problems for the last month with his split fingered fastball he allowed five runs for only the third time since may and it was mostly because of his inability to finish hitters eight tampa bay batters reached base in the first four innings five after there were two strikes the yankees took an early 3 0 lead as bernie williams hammered the first of his two home runs in the first inning but tampa bay loaded the bases in the second on a walk a single and a hit batsman and chris gomez and jason tyner each slammed two run doubles williams ripped his second homer in the sixth inning reducing the tampa bay advantage to 5 4 and once again it seemed clemens 's teammates might find a way to save him from the loss as they had done several times before but jay witasick allowed a three run double to toby hall in the seventh blowing open the game inside pitch the magnetic resonance imaging scan is a diagnostic tool but in the case of orlando hernandez it seems to have had some powers of healing mri exams on hernandez 's right elbow shoulder and neck came back clean and voila hernandez appeared to be in a much better frame of mind friday hernandez is scheduled to pitch four innings or so in relief sunday in his final outing before the start of the american league playoffs but hernandez has given so many mixed signals about his status that manager joe torre and general manager brian cashman have doubts if el duque will be available in the postseason hernandez did not speak to reporters today however he appeared to be much more upbeat in great contrast to his dour demeanor thursday i 'm confident that if everything is on track and he takes the ball he 'll be fine torre said
