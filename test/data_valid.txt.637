democrats face the wand for the democratic presidential candidates it is hard enough hearing accusations that they are soft on terrorists but should they be suspected of being terrorists apparently so since they are constantly getting frisked at airports it does not matter that the screeners often recognize the candidates unless they charter their own planes as howard dean and john kerry usually do the democrats hoping to become commander in chief must repeatedly take off their shoes and stand patiently as the screeners wave the wand from head to toe and dig through carry on luggage the screeners do not even give a pass to the candidate who gave them their jobs representative richard a gephardt who led the fight after 9 11 to create the transportation security administration after a recent speech in cedar rapids iowa touting his record on domestic security mr gephardt went to the airport and faced the wand yet again from tsa screeners who knew exactly who he was since we 're making the rules we 've got to live by the rules he said afterward i do n't have any problem with that the other candidates are also generally savvy enough to avoid complaining about being searched although they do sometimes wonder why they are designated selectees for secondary screening with such regularity it happens to me so often in chicago it 's become a standing joke with the screeners said carol moseley braun i do n't know why but i 'm always a selectee the candidates presumably get picked on because their campaigning often requires them to buy a one way ticket at the last minute that is popularly assumed to be the kind of ticket that sets off alarms at the tsa the agency refuses to identify any of the criteria used by its screening system much less explain why terrorists capable of plotting the destruction of an airplane would not be smart enough to buy a round trip ticket ahead of time it 's a rules based system that looks for certain events to identify selectees said mark hatfield an agency spokesman upon hearing of the democrats woes he said that the system is nonpartisan but woefully antiquated and due for an overhaul next year the candidates experience is good evidence that we need to replace the system matters public and private he did not go to public schools himself but dr dean is quick to see or at least imagine their virtues when he accepted the endorsement of new hampshire 's largest union the state chapter of the national education association dr dean was asked why he opposed school voucher programs which are popular with many black and latino democratic voters a skeptic might have pointed to the union officials standing by him but dr dean offered another reason the widespread use of vouchers would let students flee to private schools segregated by race and income the reason this country works is because the public school system is the last place in america where you pretty much have to get along with everybody else like it or not dr dean said if we stop doing that in the most diverse country on the face of the earth we 're going to be in a lot of trouble but public schools are not necessarily showcases of diversity especially in the cities with voucher programs which enable some students to attend relatively inexpensive private schools that are actually less segregated than public ones on the whole the use of vouchers in these cities has neither increased nor decreased racial segregation in public and private schools said paul e peterson a scholar of vouchers who is a professor at the kennedy school of government at harvard university of course there are some expensive private schools with homogenous populations like the ones dr dean attended after his warning about the dangers of americans abandoning public schools he was asked if his own lack of experience in public schools had hurt him it did in some ways he replied i had to learn a lot about diversity when i got to college dr dean went to yale i 'm moving in with whom suppose your teenager will be abroad for a year as a foreign exchange student living with a guardian which democratic presidential candidate would you pick as that guardian that was one of the questions put to a focus group of democrats and independents last week in toledo ohio by the annenberg public policy center of the university of pennsylvania at the start of the session dr dean seemed to generate the most enthusiasm but he was not chosen to be the guardian or to fill any of the other proposed roles senator joseph i lieberman was the favorite to be the overseas guardian and also to be a character witness at a trial gen wesley k clark was picked to give a speech dedicating a 9 11 memorial in new york city and to negotiate the release of a hostage overseas the voters chose mr gephardt to shepherd health care legislation through congress and senator john edwards to negotiate a bank loan it was curious that howard dean was never selected said peter hart the pollster who conducted the focus group usually when we like someone we see them as the perfect choice for any role but it looks as if the voters still have a lot to work through they like dean 's feistiness and his empowerment but they have n't really matched him up with the job of being president weekly honors best spin the same week that president bush signed an act regulating junk e mail the makers of the original spam endured more bad publicity as networks replayed images of their canned meat in saddam hussein 's grubby hideout the product placement from hell how do you respond to an unsolicited endorsement from the butcher of baghdad it 's not the most positive association conceded julie craven a spokeswoman for hormel foods but she pointed to the upside it 's further evidence of the worldwide appeal of spam giant pander he comes from arkansas but general clark is now a fan of the new england patriots if you believe a new commercial made to be shown on new hampshire television during yesterday 's game while he talks about america 's need to be strong on offense and to have a heck of a quarterback the camera pulls back to show him holding a football and wearing a patriots sweatshirt deep down he concludes we are all patriots at least until the next primary
