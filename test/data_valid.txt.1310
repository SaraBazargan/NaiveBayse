one might forgive people for assuming that senator john f kerry of massachusetts a fast rising democratic candidate for president is another in a long line of irish american politicians who have made it big in urban ethnic centers like boston he has what would seem to be an irish last name he is a regular celebrator at st patrick 's day events he even resembles another famously irish democrat from massachusetts who was elected president in 1960 and whose initials he shares former gov michael s dukakis of massachusetts who knew mr kerry well because mr kerry served as his lieutenant governor said today that he had always assumed mr kerry 's father was irish incorrectly the boston globe hired a genealogist to untangle mr kerry 's roots and discovered that his grandfather frederick a kerry who came to this country in 1905 was born as fritz kohn the son of jewish parents in what was part of the austro hungarian empire mr kohn converted to catholicism when he changed his name to kerry in 1902 mr kerry 's paternal grandmother was also jewish and changed her religion to catholicism before marrying mr kerry 's grandfather mr kerry was raised a catholic mr kerry 's office said today that the senator had long known and talked about the fact that his grandmother had been jewish but his aides said he was stunned to learn of the discovery about his grandfather the globe also reported details of how mr kerry 's grandfather had committed suicide at the copley plaza hotel in boston in 1921 shooting himself in the head in a restroom the news reported on sunday in the globe has caused quite a stir in political circles in washington and boston mr kerry 's office was quick to issue documents a transcript of a television interview and profiles in which mr kerry says he is from austrian roots to rebut any suggestion that mr kerry might have been doing a bit of an ethnic two step kerry has never said he is irish american and has always corrected it when people have assumed it because of his name david wade mr kerry 's spokesman said anybody who has every asked him he has always said austrian
