in one of the most notable events in honor of a black american held at the white house since president bush took office a year ago coretta scott king today presented mr bush a portrait of her husband the rev dr martin luther king jr the centerpiece of a lengthy commemoration of dr king who would have turned 73 this year the presentation took place in the east room where dr king once stood to witness president lyndon b johnson 's signing of the civil rights act mr bush used the opportunity to invite many black leaders to the white house the kind of event that was commonplace during the clinton administration but mr bush who received less than 10 percent of the black vote in the 2000 election has often struggled to find ways to reach out to black leaders today he tried to bridge that political gap talking warmly about dr king and his movement and signing a proclamation for the holiday the kind that american presidents usually publish without ceremony standing in the white house marking a national holiday in dr king 's memory we are now two generations and a world away from montgomery selma and birmingham as he knew them mr bush said in the audience along with dr king 's family was condoleezza rice who was a young girl in birmingham during the civil rights movement ms rice occasionally speaks of that time and the famous church bombing that took the lives of children she lived near rod paige mr bush 's education secretary also attended and mr bush said the department would soon announce a martin luther king jr scholars program for talented students but he gave no details the most prominent black member of mr bush 's cabinet secretary of state colin l powell was traveling back to washington from tokyo and could not attend the event also missing were some of dr king 's closest aides in the civil rights era including the rev jesse jackson and andrew young the former mayor of atlanta and delegate to the united nations the white house did not say if they were invited or could not attend with washington quiet on the federal holiday the white house announced that mr bush 's budget for next year would include 350 million to strengthen historically black and hispanic colleges and universities an increase of 12 million or a little more than 3 percent over the current levels previously mr bush has pledged to increase financing for these colleges and universities by 30 percent from 2001 to 2005 but most of those increases will now have to be in the later years if mr bush is to meet his pledge earlier in the day laura bush went to atlanta and spoke at the newly renovated ebenezer baptist church where she talked at length about the administration 's education bill mrs bush said her husband was dedicated to the liberation of all americans from the shackles of illiteracy and ignorance and dr king 's widow praised the new law she then flew to washington for the ceremony joined by two of their four children there was no overt political agenda in today 's event but the king holiday has not always been vigorously celebrated at the white house mr bush who often talks of religion focused on dr king 's religious teachings we see martin luther king in many ways he said perhaps above all we should see him as a minister of the gospel that faith gave dr king the grace to forgive and the strength to love he refused to answer hatred with hatred or meet violence with violence then mr bush and the king family sat for a dramatic interpretation of dr king 's aug 28 1963 i have a dream speech performed by student debaters at texas southern university bringing the audience of black leaders and washington notables to their feet white house officials said they were surprised that there was no portrait of dr king in the white house previously but they did not say where in the building it would be hung
