like verdi in his old age the composer claudio monteverdi seemed to retire from opera only to return to the genre shortly before his death with some of his most masterly work to judge at least from what has survived his last opera l'incoronazione di poppea with its detailed musical psychological portraits is among the greatest operas in the literature as the second in its three part monteverdi cycle the brooklyn academy of music brought pierre audi 's 1993 production from the dutch national opera to brooklyn on tuesday night unfortunately and curiously mr audi for all of his analysis failed to turn the figures onstage into three dimensional characters or to develop a theatrical language strong enough to offer as an alternative the result had at once a stylized distance and a tendency toward hysterical ranting one of the distinguishing characteristics of poppea is that it features a group of not very likable characters who are compelling in spite of themselves here that compelling element largely failed to come through nor did it come from the orchestra pit where christophe rousset led the group les talens lyriques an early music ensemble the playing while sensitive was also muddy the rhythmic crispness of monteverdi 's austere music was often masked beneath the approximate tunings and occasional squawks of the musicians period instruments which are capable of producing more effective support mr rousset tended to underline the hysterical tendencies of the singers in dramatic passages at other times he gave them so much space to express themselves that the pace became leaden the souffle fallen that said there were passages when everything did come together very well and the singers did n't uphold their end sometimes it seems that trying to capture monteverdi 's simplicity is one of the most difficult exercises a trained singer can confront this is n't the first time i 've heard a poppea troubled by the vocal uncertainties of its cast the score calls for florid singing but also a madrigal 's straightforwardness without a lot of vibrato finding that balance was n't easy for many of the singers involved two of the best were sandrine piau who in the relatively small role of drusilla maintained a vocal freshness and jean paul fouchecourt in the character and drag role of poppea 's nurse arnalta mr fouchecourt 's costume by emi wada a sculptured dress that preserved a rigid hourglass form topped with an equally geometric wig seemed to move the action into a kind of alice in wonderland world but his singing was far better than the campiness of his character might indicate brigitte balleys a mezzo was the emperor nero played here as a manic half insane weakling intoxicated with power and with sexual desire attached to his idea of poppea which drives him to semi orgasm in the embraces of his henchman lucano mark tucker but which is hardly able to confront poppea face on ms balleys achieved some powerful if piercing singing in places as did graciela araya as nero 's rejected wife ottavia cynthia haymon as poppea was also uneven but played the role convincingly moving from the flushness of conceited ambition to a naked vulnerability in the final duet her coronation scene when having achieved her goal of becoming empress she is suddenly unsure for all of the vocal unevenness this final duet pur ti miro in part because of the direction was one of the best things about the evening if only the rest of it had achieved that level the opera will be performed again on friday evening and sunday afternoon
