christine andreas cafe carlyle when christine andreas sings you 're in the presence of a true believer in the impossible dreams most of us have put aside or at least modified as we 've grown up ms andreas may be over 40 but she still projects the blushing radiance of an ingenue and in her new show here 's to the ladies a songbook of broadway 's first ladies her princess in waiting aura is enhanced by the role of adoring acolyte to the legendary divas of yesteryear the show which runs through april 7 at at the cafe 35 east 76th street manhattan is a well chosen songbook of numbers associated with ethel merman mary martin gertrude lawrence barbara cook julie andrews helen morgan angela lansbury and barbra streisand each of whom is introduced with her own star struck personal anecdote ms cook who 's still going strong is praised for showing that ingenues do n't have to be wimps while merman is celebrated for not being as soft and as pink as a nursery the role of acolyte suits ms andreas especially well since she made her name on broadway stepping into ms andrews 's shoes as eliza doolittle in a revival of my fair lady and because her voice with its sweet hummingbird vibrato still conveys the bursting eagerness of someone yearning to please accompanied on piano by lee musiker whose gorgeous jazzy improvisations stretch her singing in a pop jazz direction and on bass by dick sarpola ms andreas lightly glosses the styles of several of the legends being honored some people from gypsy for instance is inflected with an emphatic mermanesque nasality while my heart belongs to daddy is tinged with a martin like playfulness although ms andreas can be witty and playful it is on the ballads especially they say it 's wonderful and bill in which she delicately kills with the sheer beauty of her voice it 's almost enough to turn one back into a true believer stephen holden
