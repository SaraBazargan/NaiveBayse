with their top trade target reliever ugueth urbina traded to florida from texas tonight the yankees have moved into serious talks with the mets about armando benitez and with the san francisco giants about felix rodriguez two yankees officials said from the principal owner george steinbrenner on down yankee officials say the club must acquire a right handed setup man for mariano rivera even with antonio osuna coming off the disabled list on saturday rodriguez has emerged as a top target but the deal is complicated the mets would send benitez to the giants for rodriguez then ship rodriguez to the yankees for prospects one yankees official questioned the wisdom of that deal reasoning that the yankees would be giving up prospects the caliber of benitez but would receive a less accomplished pitcher rodriguez in return the official said the yankees would be more likely to make the deal if the giants gave them a prospect in addition to rodriguez money would also be a factor in the potential deal one national league advance scout said the giants could not take on any salary and benitez will make 69 million this season rodriguez makes 31 million steinbrenner would be outraged if yankees prospects became stars for the mets but the urbina deal could motivate both teams the mets had shopped benitez to the marlins and the yankees had talked to the rangers about urbina who went to the marlins for three minor league players including first baseman adrian gonzalez the no 1 overall pick in the 2000 draft one yankees official also said that the mets were not trying to extract an excessive price from them simply because the teams are cross town rivals which had concerned the yankees that might mean that the mets were not asking for brandon claussen the yankees top pitching prospect and a player the team is unlikely to move texas had asked for claussen in the urbina talks benitez would become the closer for the giants whose regular closer robb nen is out for the season it is possible the yankees could deal for benitez directly believing that he would shine as a setup man but some club officials fear that benitez 's psyche is too fragile for new york as his struggles in big games for the mets have shown clemens to miss fenway andy pettitte will start the yankees first game after the all star game break with roger clemens david wells mike mussina and jeff weaver to follow that sets up mussina weaver and pettitte to start in boston from july 25 to 27 clemens who angered the red sox by hitting kevin millar last weekend will not pitch in the series pedro martinez who hit alfonso soriano and derek jeter injuring them monday will face mussina in the opener silence from the boss gordon blakeley the yankees senior vice president for baseball operations would still like to know where he stands in the decision making process of the yankees class aaa columbus team steinbrenner acted last week to give more authority to columbus manager bucky dent who has philosophical differences with blakeley blakeley had expected to speak with steinbrenner about it by now but has still not heard from him i do n't know if we need a meeting but i would like to talk about it blakeley said i guess i would like to know what 's transpired blakeley insists that columbus 's drew henson will remain a third baseman but dent wants to try henson in the outfield johnson nears rehab stint first baseman nick johnson is finally showing progress in his recovery from a stress fracture in his right hand the yankees expect johnson to begin a rehabilitation assignment next friday at columbus or class aa trenton and he could return within a week after that blakeley said if he does johnson would be activated for the three game series in boston gold glove on bench third baseman robin ventura has six gold glove awards but manager joe torre acknowledged today that enrique wilson has better range ventura started at designated hitter tonight with wilson at third one reason for that torre said was that andy pettitte was likely to induce grounders to third and wilson can get to more balls on skydome 's quick artificial turf something to prove reliever juan acevedo released by the yankees in mid june entered tonight 's game with a 000 earned run average in seven games for toronto acevedo said he had struggled with the yankees because he tried to pitch through a back injury and he said he was mad at them for hastily releasing him acevedo released the day after he blew a one run lead in roger clemens 's third attempt to reach 300 victories had a 771 era for the yankees it 's going to be fun facing those guys acevedo said and fun showing them that i can do it
