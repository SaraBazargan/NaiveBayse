as i watch members of congress scold wall street research analysts for recommending stocks that had the audacity to decline as i read about analysts duping investors with fraudulent reports i rub my eyes and think have these people ever talked to an analyst in the late 1990 's i worked as an associate research analyst at goldman sachs and the prevailing cartoons of analysts as brilliant puppeteers manipulating markets or as useless empty headed puppets seem to me unfair and incomplete analysts are far from perfect and in the days of the bubble some were careless or complacent but their activities are more varied benign and valuable than commonly portrayed investment banks employ analysts to serve the bank 's brokerage clients analysts spend their days gathering and assessing information about companies and industries rating stocks buy or sell or something in between and communicating these recommendations and their insights to the bank 's clients none of which is as straightforward as it sounds first analysts are daily reminded that the stock market will make a fool of you predicting stock prices is predicting the future and being wrong is part of the job second analysts are subject to internal and external pressures to be positive on essentially every stock they cover from the inside investment bankers arm twist analysts to write and speak favorably about their firms existing and prospective clients from the outside some executives bypass their bankers and go straight to the analysts hoping to win a higher rating and hoping no doubt that the fruits of that rating will enable them to buy more gold umbrella stands and diamond studded shower rods the response of analysts to this pressure varies greatly some cave some do n't most however are neither notably corrupt nor especially brave yet whatever their individual mettle all analysts face a powerful force that checks the influence of bankers and pushes them toward a more ethical path the pressure to win the ear of institutional investors analysts dedicate almost all their time and energy to serving institutional investors the people who manage mutual funds pension funds and hedge funds like a dozen waiters climbing over one another to wait on a new table analysts furiously compete with their counterparts at other banks to be the most useful voice to fund managers on disney say or general electric it is this competition more than anything else that keeps analysts honest analysts whose research fails to hold up quickly find that fund managers will no longer return their calls then they quickly find themselves out of work especially these days analysts whose research is valuable find themselves voted onto institutional investor 's annual poll of all star analysts an honor that results in lots of prestige and lots of money of course there are some gray areas occasionally an analyst gives the bankers and their clients the higher ratings they want often with a tepidly positive rating like outperform but in the candid conversations between analysts and institutional investors the nuances of an investment are discussed official ratings almost never come up that 's because institutional investors do n't care about ratings fund managers are not schoolchildren looking for instructions on what to buy they look to analysts for specific information and general insight more to the point they understand that opinions about a stock change every minute with its price while an analyst may write a report enthusiastic about a company 's long term prospects he or she may be less enthusiastic about its stock on a given day critics must understand that analysts have succeeded in making themselves necessary for institutional investors few of the recent caricatures of jack grubman for example note that the former salomon smith barney analyst reached his position of power with the obscenity of his compensation because he was institutional investors favorite telecom analyst these investors were n't tricked they were aware of mr grubman 's well deserved reputation for investment banking hanky panky his too convenient ratings changes and his penchant for recommending companies all the way into bankruptcy but as a friend who met with him earlier this year told me mr grubman 's insights were perceptive after the meeting my friend 's firm was better equipped to invest in telecom companies but someone forgot to tell small investors how all this worked when analysts more out of laziness than corruption allowed reports or ratings to persist that did n't reflect their latest views they misled investors who did n't have access to the financial world 's cozy candor for this analysts deserve part of the blame for the losses amateur investors incurred more blame however should go to those who never explained to small investors how even the best wall street research is conditional fluid and fallible in their celebration of the limitless possibilities of stock ownership online brokers traditional brokers and the press created a culture of reckless ill informed investing they were aided in this by a particularly unconscionable group of blow dried analysts and fund managers mostly in the technology and telecommunications sectors who went out of their way to reduce the complex hazardous investing process into breezy sound bites they were partly aided by the bubble itself which seemed to make everyone from about 1994 on forget that stocks could actually go down and while i sympathize with people who lost money on banker tinged recommendations many of them probably lost much more investing in stocks that have had nothing to do with the current conflict of interest scandal stocks about which analysts brokers the financial press and people armed with their own half baked ideas were simply wrong with all this in mind the plan advanced by eliot spitzer new york 's attorney general and other regulators to reform wall street research seems intended more for the headlines than the bottom line of investors brokerage statements although parts of the plan are commendable its emphasis on providing independent research for small investors officially validates the culture of do it yourself investing that caused more harm in recent years than bad analyst recommendations if regulators really want to help small investors they should find a way to remind them that professionals are frequently wrong and that amateurs can not regularly beat the market on their own regulators perhaps should take a cue from cigarette packaging on every page of every analyst report in bold letters the message should be blunt the person who wrote this report is a fallible human being and in even bolder letters small investors should not buy individual stocks gary sernovitz is author of the contrarians a novel
