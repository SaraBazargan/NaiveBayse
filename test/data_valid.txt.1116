today marks the roman catholics feast of the assumption honoring the moment that they believe god brought the virgin mary into heaven so here 's a fact appropriate for the day americans are three times as likely to believe in the virgin birth of jesus 83 percent as in evolution 28 percent so this day is an opportunity to look at perhaps the most fundamental divide between america and the rest of the industrialized world faith religion remains central to american life and is getting more so in a way that is true of no other industrialized country with the possible exception of south korea americans believe 58 percent to 40 percent that it is necessary to believe in god to be moral in contrast other developed countries overwhelmingly believe that it is not necessary in france only 13 percent agree with the us view for details on the polls cited in this column go to www nytimescom kristofresponds the faith in the virgin birth reflects the way american christianity is becoming less intellectual and more mystical over time the percentage of americans who believe in the virgin birth actually rose five points in the latest poll my grandfather was fairly typical of his generation a devout and active presbyterian elder he nonetheless believed firmly in evolution and regarded the virgin birth as a pious legend those kinds of mainline christians are vanishing replaced by evangelicals since 1960 the number of pentecostalists has increased fourfold while the number of episcopalians has dropped almost in half the result is a gulf not only between america and the rest of the industrialized world but a growing split at home as well one of the most poisonous divides is the one between intellectual and religious america some liberals wear t shirts declaring so many right wing christians so few lions on the other side there are attitudes like those on a web site dutyisourscom gwbush htm explaining the 2000 election this way god defeated armies of philistines and others with confusion dimpled and hanging chads may also be because of god 's intervention on those who were voting incorrectly why is gw bush our president it was god 's choice the virgin mary is an interesting prism through which to examine america 's emphasis on faith because most biblical scholars regard the evidence for the virgin birth and for mary 's assumption into heaven which was proclaimed as catholic dogma only in 1950 as so shaky that it pretty much has to be a leap of faith as the catholic theologian hans kung puts it in on being a christian the virgin birth is a collection of largely uncertain mutually contradictory strongly legendary narratives an echo of virgin birth myths that were widespread in many parts of the ancient world jaroslav pelikan the great yale historian and theologian says in his book mary through the centuries that the earliest references to mary like mark 's gospel the first to be written or paul 's letter to the galatians do n't mention anything unusual about the conception of jesus the gospels of matthew and luke do say mary was a virgin but internal evidence suggests that that part of luke in particular may have been added later by someone else it is written for example in a different kind of greek than the rest of that gospel yet despite the lack of scientific or historical evidence and despite the doubts of biblical scholars america is so pious that not only do 91 percent of christians say they believe in the virgin birth but so do an astonishing 47 percent of us non christians i 'm not denigrating anyone 's beliefs and i do n't pretend to know why america is so much more infused with religious faith than the rest of the world but i do think that we 're in the middle of another religious great awakening and that while this may bring spiritual comfort to many it will also mean a growing polarization within our society but mostly i 'm troubled by the way the great intellectual traditions of catholic and protestant churches alike are withering leaving the scholarly and religious worlds increasingly antagonistic i worry partly because of the time i 've spent with self satisfied and unquestioning mullahs and imams for the islamic world is in crisis today in large part because of a similar drift away from a rich intellectual tradition and toward the mystical the heart is a wonderful organ but so is the brain op ed columnist e mail nicholas nytimescom
