when he was in seattle last week vice president al gore dropped by a fund raising reception for gov gary locke of washington the governor in introducing the vice president to the crowd followed a script suggested by mr gore 's presidential campaign and here is what the campaign wanted these people to know he 's not only a great person but he 's very funny governor locke said he is a person who is committed to his family mr locke went on he is always picking up the phone to check on his mom governor locke like countless others who are introducing mr gore around the country these days is what is known in the trade as a validator or a character witness someone who can attest to the nature of the real al gore and reassure voters that he is a decent man a family man a good guy although mr gore has been campaigning intensely for more than a year now and has been in public life for nearly a quarter century he is still having trouble getting across this basic message that is one reason why the campaign is enlisting scores of validators democrats like senator evan bayh of indiana and senator john kerry of massachusetts and deploying them on talk shows and the campaign trail their job is not just to attest to mr gore 's humanity although that is a large part of it they must also make the case for his policy proposals and be prepared to scold gov george w bush of texas mr gore 's republican rival so that mr gore does not have to do it himself and thereby contradict the positive good guy image that the campaign is so desperately seeking to convey the deployment of validators is just one element of a new phase of the gore campaign one that the vice president agreed last week in an interview could be as dramatic a turning point as one last fall when he moved his campaign headquarters from washington to nashville and started engaging his now vanquished democratic challenger former senator bill bradley with zeal and he and his advisers hope the payoff is as great the new phase is marked by a concerted effort to transmit more of mr gore 's personal side along with a positive presentation of his policy proposals it includes a media blitz he plans to begin on tuesday in new york one so extensive that it will almost seem like a relaunching of his campaign as he begins a progress and prosperity tour across the middle atlantic states and the midwest the new phase also features a multimillion dollar advertising campaign a retreat by mr gore from his harsh assessments of governor bush and a cheery message of optimism as he told a group of financial contributors on thursday night in beverly hills calif we 'll make this decade the brightest time in american history unfortunately for mr gore the shift in strategy plays into one of the republicans chief criticisms of him that he lacks consistency al gore reinvents himself again blares a news release from the bush campaign it goes on to list six gore incarnations since last summer the underdog the average joe the alpha male the crusading reformer the negative attacker and now the thinking man with a heart the strategy also reflects some concern by the campaign that mr gore needs to inspire core democratic constituencies with whom he should be comfortably ahead the tour will take him to places like scranton pa and cincinnati conveniently located in battleground states chris lehane mr gore 's spokesman said that this period was less a shift than a reflection of the natural ebb and flow of any campaign there will be plenty of time down the road to draw the comparisons and contrasts with the options that governor bush wants to pursue he said on the first day of his progress and prosperity tour in new york mr gore is to stand with robert e rubin the former treasury secretary and wall street giant at his side and begin a national discussion on the upbeat subject of how best to use the burgeoning budget surplus and keep the economy roaring the white house projects a surplus of 746 billion over the next decade and the gore tour scheduled to span the next two weeks is designed to coincide with forecasts of an even greater surplus the emphasis on the nation 's prosperity will give mr gore a chance to remind voters that he has been part of the administration that has presided over the longest economic expansion in the nation 's history this his advisers say is his strongest suit and provides the most compelling argument for his election as president already president clinton another validator is out making this case on saturday in minneapolis mr clinton told 700 donors at a fund raising reception you need to know that there has never been anybody in that job who had more of an impact on more issues across a broader range of areas and that a lot of the success we enjoy today would not have been possible if it had n't been for him mr gore is to push proposals for helping to pay down the national debt protect medicare by removing it from the budget process eliminate the long term social security deficit provide tax incentives make investments in education health care and job training and create a new kind of personal retirement account one based on a clinton proposal for universal savings accounts the prosperity tour coincides with the opening of a two month 25 million advertising campaign financed by the democratic national committee but produced by gore consultants the first commercial running in 15 states touts his support for a medicare benefit to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs future commercials leading to the democratic convention in august are to focus on parts of mr gore 's personal biography and his life outside washington as a soldier in vietnam and a divinity student and journalist in tennessee and of course as a family man his wife tipper who has been keeping a separate campaign schedule has been appearing with him lately on monday night at a town meeting with women in new jersey he is to be accompanied by his oldest daughter karenna we want people to have an opportunity to learn more about al gore the person where he learned his values and how he would lead said doug hattaway a gore spokesman mr gore has also ceased attacking mr bush although he spent much of the spring denouncing mr bush as inexperienced and proffering risky schemes he has not mentioned mr bush 's name in public since may 26 when he derided his call for an expansive missile defense system since then mr gore has only sparingly referred to him as the other fellow or the other side at the same time mr gore is stepping up his pleas to democrats to work hard for him as he said to a group of democratic mayors last week i 'm asking you to really turn it on for me
