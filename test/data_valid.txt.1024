it was a quiet race to begin with andrew j spano a popular incumbent with support from democrats and conservatives alike seemed immune to the challenge by lawrence i horowitz a political newcomer with little financial wherewithal and even less name recognition still at the start of the westchester county executive 's race local issues concerning schools affordable housing traffic jams and airport curfews were raised and discussed then sept 11 struck and in a reversal of the familiar adage all politics became global westchester residents suddenly wanted to know more about osama bin laden than about county tax cuts the campaigns of both mr spano the democratic candidate and mr horowitz the republican came to a halt post sept 11 there has been no interest in the race none mr horowitz a lawyer from chappaqua said the local paper has stopped writing about it i 've left messages for the league of women voters to see if they will schedule a debate they had n't even called me back it has been particularly hard to raise money and particularly hard to campaign this year because of the events of sept 11 mr spano agreed that this has been an odd campaign year now instead of doing my job and campaigning i 'm doing my job and concentrating on security stuff and campaigning said mr spano noting that he has had regular conversations with officials from the federal bureau of investigation and with the new homeland security office we 've got to look out for the power plant the water quality the airport and we 've been getting anthrax complaints then you get a call about the campaign you handle it because it 's your job but it 's an annoyance now still some observers say the distractions and the suspension of campaigning will have little impact on a race that neither party ever saw as much of a contest the county executive was a favorite to begin with said anthony a cupaiuolo professor of public administration at pace university he cut taxes he maintained a level of county services things are going well in the county a month 's blackout in the campaign only makes it more difficult for his opponent to get out whatever message he wanted to get out but i personally do n't think it would have made any difference in who is going to win it might impact turnout negatively but that 's it things are now gearing up in the final weeks of the campaign the league of women voters will hold a debate for candidates in all countywide races on thursday at 2 pm at pace graduate center on martine avenue in white plains news 12 westchester will also sponsor a debate between the candidates for county executive tomorrow at 7 pm the candidates say they are back on the campaign trail now with visits to train stations fund raisers candidate forums and parades mr horowitz 50 has not held public office before he lost a bid for newcastle town justice five years ago and some speculate that by taking up the race for county executive mr horowitz hopes the republican party will back him for a more winnable race like a judgeship but mr horowitz said he is a viable candidate in this race he meets commuters at metro north stations and tells them that he favors a federal no fly zone around the indian point nuclear power plant that he wants to develop a stronger ethics code for county government and that he wants to reduce energy costs to county residents he said he has raised about 45000 for his campaign mr spano 65 who is seeking his second four year term previously served as county clerk he has raised about 13 million and said he planned to spend the money on television radio and print ads even though the race does not appear to be close the spano campaign wants voters to know that during his tenure mr spano acquired 2500 acres of park land reduced county taxes and tried to combat the digital divide by providing computers to needy students and the westchester library system we 're running a full campaign now said dierdra gray mr spano 's co campaign manager it 's not as intense and hopefully candidates are kind but hey it 's almost election day
