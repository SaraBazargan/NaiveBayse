what does the summer hold for westchester 's beaches sunny days and sparkling water or murky seas and beach closed signs the best answer officials can offer is this it depends on the rains one thing you ca n't control is mother nature said larry schwartz chief adviser to the county executive if she opens the floodgates there 's not much you can do but county and state officials and even environmentalists agree that things are improving and in the next few years even a rainy summer wo n't necessarily mean closed beaches last summer various westchester beaches were closed for nine days and one harbor island in mamaroneck was closed all summer two main problems contribute to water contamination and beach closings one is that westchester 's old sewer pipes some of which date to the early 1900 's are overwhelmed when there is a heavy rain water seeps into the cracked pipes which can mean thousands of extra gallons of water pouring through the county 's seven treatment plants that 's too much water moving too quickly to be adequately treated according to anthony m landi the commissioner of public works for the county another problem is non point source pollution which is litter and dirt that collects on the streets and runs into the storm drains and eventually out to the sound both types of pollution can cause health and environmental problems county officials have been grappling with the situation for more than a decade things were so bad in the early 1990 's that any time there was more than an inch of rain westchester 's 50 private beaches and six public ones were automatically closed in 1992 the previous county administration entered into a consent order with the state department of environmental conservation to evaluate the sewer system and repair the leakage problems they did the evaluation in 1994 said joseph marcogliese regional water engineer for the department then the repairs were supposed to be done and nothing really happened when the new administration came in they immediately found themselves in violation of the consent decree that meant county officials had to pay more than 600000 in fines since then however the county has been complying spending about 39 million to rehabilitate municipal sewer lines and 33 million to build large concrete containers at the new rochelle sanitary system to chlorinate and hold overflow during heavy rains officials hope far less untreated sewage will pour into the sound once all this is in place expected in 2004 this is a major environmental initiative mr schwartz said the county is trying to do everything it can to protect its drinking water and the sound the county has already spent more than 6 million repairing its own sewer lines now it is working on sewage pipes from the municipalities and in exchange municipalities have agreed to crack down on illegal hookups from storm drains and sump pumps to sewer systems we need it all to be done to see changes mr marcogliese said and then there has to be routine maintenance it ca n't be done once and then do nothing for the next 50 years of particular concern to some county residents is the closure of harbor island in mamaroneck last summer because of elevated bacteria levels in the water it was the only beach in the county to be shut for the entire summer about 30 years ago harbor island the only public beach in mamaroneck was so crowded longtime residents recall they could n't find a place to put a towel during the summer months as water quality declined people stopped going there but last summer 's beach closure has sparked a movement among residents to revitalize the area part of the appeal of mamaroneck is that it 's a seaside town said helen rafferty a mamaroneck resident who is involved in concerned citizens for harbor island the beach and park could be the heart and soul a public waterfront is the most precious commodity a town could have and it needs to be made a priority county and village officials say they are trying to pinpoint the cause of the high levels of coliform indicating fecal contamination in water around harbor island mr blau said the emissions from a specific storm system outflow pipe that goes into the sheldrake river which then flows into mamaroneck river contain high coliform counts the pipe is in the industrial section of mamaroneck village but mr blau said it is not yet known if the contamination can be traced to one company he said officials plan to perform dye testing on the pipe to track the water flow in addition they are visiting businesses in the area to make sure floor drains and bathroom pipes are hooked up to the sewer systems rather than the storm drains our goal is that people can swim at harbor island this summer mr blau said it is not just county officials who say that things have improved amanda waters a policy analyst for the environmental group save the sound said it does seem that our efforts to clean up and restore long island sound are beginning to pay off but there 's still a long road ahead of us she pointed out that one of the major concerns is that some types of marine life in the sound like lobsters are experiencing severe health problems an environmental protection agency report notes that beginning in 1999 and continuing through 2000 there was a massive die off of lobsters in the western sound the report said the die off was catastrophic to the 29 million lobster industry the cause is still being investigated on the positive side the amount of nitrogen discharged into the sound has decreased in 1990 new york and connecticut began a plan to reduce the levels and in 1998 they reached an agreement with the federal government to cut nitrogen by 585 percent from the 1990 levels over the next 15 years through better treatment of wastewater so far nitrogen levels have dropped 192 percent from 1990 algae thrive on high nitrogen levels and a larger algae population consumes more oxygen leaving little for fish large algae blooms also make the water unappealing human waste contains a great deal of nitrogen and traditional sewage treatment has not included removal of the nitrogen said mark tedesco director of the environmental protection agency 's long island sound office connecticut and new york are upgrading their treatment facilities to include removal of nitrogen while the sound is cleaner it still has an image problem the county health commissioner dr joshua lipsman said part of the problem is that we make sure the public knows when a beach is contaminated but we do n't announce when it 's a beautiful day at the beaches people assimilate that in their worldview that the beaches are dirty most of the time the water is clean
