to the editor re un human rights official wo n't seek another term news article march 19 i was saddened but not surprised by the announcement that the united nations high commissioner for human rights mary robinson would not seek another term she brought great honor to her position reporting in an unbiased manner while working under enormous pressures from those who did n't want a spotlight shown on their transgressions unfortunately it appears that the united states got its way by undercutting ms robinson for reporting on the united states and israel 's bullying tactics consequently if ms robinson sticks to her decision the world community will be the loser flora ramonowski schenectady ny march 21 2002
