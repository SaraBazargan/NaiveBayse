the tanglewood festival of contemporary music ended on tuesday night with a blazing magnificently played concert in ozawa hall given by an orchestra of the advanced students here with oliver knussen conducting it was a heartening experience in several ways young musicians were performing newish music all four works dated from the 1990 's with relish and enthusiasm recent works were gaining repeat performances against the pattern in current musical life that new pieces are rapidly forgotten while old ones are remembered all too well and four composers of different ages and backgrounds were heard putting their distinctive marks on the symphony orchestra three of the pieces were in the nature of symphonic poems frankly and freely evocative of some image or expressive urge mark anthony turnage 's silent cities was a simultaneous rage and lament at the pity of war vehement under a close fitting garment of numbing distress and musically related to his opera the silver tassie augusta read thomas 's orbital beacons looked at the night sky or more at the mythological scenes the ancients detected in the constellations scenes of longing and travel the great procession by charles wuorinen the biggest piece on the program playing for over a half hour was a kind of musical engraving to illustrate dante 's purgatorio highly articulate full of characteristic gruff and acerbic sidestrokes and full too of driving angular rhythms that should work well when the new york city ballet gets around to producing it and the two companion works they also commissioned both mr wuorinen 's and ms thomas 's scores were composed of several short movements with a greater thrust of continuity in the work by mr wuorinen and a more sensuous poetry in that by ms thomas her instrumental combinations were beautifully effective and ideas often ran smoothly from one ensemble to another though more could have been made of the unusual seating pattern with circles of mixed soloists around the conductor and the usual string layout beyond orchestras even temporary orchestras have a way of falling into certain patterns of sound and here was the opportunity to disrupt those patterns more assertively in the context of all this descriptive music magnus lindberg 's gran duo was refreshing in sustaining itself purely and decisively by musical invention spinning out one long thought through groupings of woodwind and brass instruments two waiting traps were duly acknowledged and negotiated the scylla of mixed perkiness and solemnity in imitation of stravinsky 's symphonies for this combination and the charybdis of conventional wind blending which mr lindberg would suggest by letting the brass insert a solid bass for a moment then take them out to go on with his confident tangential journey the evening before many of the same players were in the same place giving a beautiful performance of the vibratoless slow clouds that make up the score to jo kondo 's setting of the noh play hagoromo the inclusion of a dancer added nothing mr kondo 's concern being not at all with physical drama but with the extended expression of a single awesome moment in the chilled and rarefied orchestral interventions and in the gently contoured vocal line delivered superbly with beauty and calm by eudora brown
