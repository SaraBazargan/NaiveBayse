the nation 's unemployment rate fell below 4 percent in april for the first time in 30 years the labor department announced yesterday as employers hired among others tens of thousands of census takers restaurant employees and temporary workers in a boom that showed no signs of letting up indeed there was little evidence in the employment numbers a total of 340000 new jobs last month and a jobless rate of 39 percent that the nine year old expansion the longest period of uninterrupted growth in america 's history might be weakening in response to the federal reserve 's attempt to slow the economy by raising interest rates everywhere you look you see the supply of people available for work continuing to shrink pretty rapidly said john youngdahl a senior economist at goldman sachs although there is not much pressure yet on companies to raise prices the inflation rate has begun to creep up and the fed must think about where we will be a year from now the economy may be in its best shape since the 1960 's but the fed 's great fear often expressed by its chairman alan greenspan is that job shortages will eventually give workers enough bargaining power to push up labor costs ahead of productivity gains while wage gains remained relatively modest and many of the latest jobs including those created by the census bureau are temporary employers may still respond to the tight labor market by raising prices to cover the higher costs or simply because the strong economy allows them to wall street reacted as if the fed would be successful in containing any inflationary threat even if that meant it would have to be more aggressive in raising interest rates stock prices shot up instead of plunging as they often do in reaction to a strong employment report the dow jones industrial average gained more than 165 points to close at 1057786 the nasdaq rose 26 percent and bond yields edged up modestly page c3 just a week ago the consensus among analysts and brokers was that the fed 's policy makers would probably raise the short term interest rates they control by one quarter of a percentage point to 625 at their may 16 meeting that would be the sixth such increase since last june the new consensus apparent in polls taken after yesterday 's job numbers were released is for an increase of half a percentage point in rates this month wall street 's exuberance seemed to reflect a view that half a percentage point in midmonth should be sufficient to make a dent in the robust economy god only knows why the markets are doing what they are doing said david wyss chief economist at standard poor 's dri all i can figure is that they figure the fed is going to do a half point and that will be it get the tightening over and they can go back to business as usual still mr wyss and other economists noted that a booming stock market complicates the fed 's task by encouraging the all out consumer spending that has kept the economy booming the stock market certainly did not help the fed out mr youngdahl said april 's employment report was striking for the evidence it offered that the pool of people still available for hire is shrinking that pool fell by 426000 men and women falling below 99 million last month the lowest level since the labor department began to track it in 1994 mr greenspan pays particular attention to this statistic because with fewer people available existing workers in theory at least are in a better position to demand and receive strong wage increases with the unemployment rate falling from 41 percent to 39 percent the lowest since january 1970 the pool now consists of 55 million people labeled as officially unemployed because they are actively looking for jobs and 44 million others who tell labor department surveyors that they want to work but are not currently looking there is clearly some evidence of accelerating wages and prices said jared bernstein a labor economist at the economic policy institute noting that labor costs by several measures are growing at an annual rate of at least 36 percent and inflation is rising at a similar pace but he wondered whether wages were pushing prices or the other way around if you track this month to month he said it looks more like tight labor markets are allowing workers to press for wage gains to keep up with prices that reflect the rising cost of oil whatever the cause and effect the average hourly wage of production workers rose 6 cents last month to 1364 up 36 percent over the last 12 months that is roughly in line with the gains recorded month after month for more than a year but broader measures covering benefits as well as wages show a recent jump in company payments for health insurance reflecting the administration 's concern that an overly aggressive fed could damage the economy in an election year alexis m herman the secretary of labor argued that labor productivity was rising quickly enough to offset rising wages in the midst of this debate over interest rates she said we must keep the focus on the nation 's strong productivity to absorb any pressure on wages president clinton pointing to the social benefits of a strong economy called attention to the lowest unemployment rate for blacks and hispanics ever recorded for hispanics unemployment dropped to 54 percent from 63 percent in march and for blacks the rate edged down to 72 percent from 73 percent while spread broadly across business and government job creation was particularly strong at the census bureau which added 73000 part time census takers last month on top of the 115000 added in march but that hiring should taper off quickly to count the population the bureau has hired 500000 workers this year and now is up to full strength a spokesman for the bureau said over all the employment gains of 340000 while strong were down from an even stronger 458000 advance in march but job creation in the private sector remains robust averaging 222000 a month since january up from 198000 a month last year total employment rose to 1311 million in april restaurants made the biggest contribution adding 80000 jobs while temporary help agencies added 46000 jobs companies can not find people so they turn to the temp agencies which are luring the elderly back into the work force kids into part time work and housewives into work mr wyss said the percentage of the population now holding jobs edged up last month to a record 649 percent from 647 percent in march only one major industry lost ground construction jobs fell by 55000 after having risen by 90000 the month before manufacturers also increased their rolls but by only 11000 jobs although the workweek in manufacturing rose by nearly half an hour and overtime pay also increased
