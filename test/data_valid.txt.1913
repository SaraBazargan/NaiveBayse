a few years ago azucena sanchez scott a resident of los angeles underwent chemotherapy for breast cancer on one occasion a man she had never seen before joined her doctor in the examination room the doctor said the man would be observing the examination the doctor told ms sanchez scott to undress to the waist and lie down on the examination table with her feet in the stirrups the other man watched as the doctor examined her upper body according to court papers during the examination ms sanchez scott began to feel extremely hot and flushed she took a pocket fan from her purse and her distress increasing began to fan herself the doctor took the fan from her and gave it to the other man the stranger began fanning the patient and both men began to laugh ms sanchez scott tried to take the fan back but the stranger would not relinquish it ms sanchez scott dressed as quickly as she could when the examination ended she later learned that the stranger was not a medical person he was a drug company salesman ms sanchez scott went to court asserting that her privacy had been violated a judge carolyn kuhl dismissed the case she ruled that because ms sanchez scott had not openly objected to the man 's presence in the examination room she lost whatever right to privacy she may have had in judge kuhl 's view at least from a legal standpoint this humiliation of a seriously ill woman in the supposed sanctity of her doctor 's office was quite ok a three judge court of appeals panel disagreed and unanimously overturned judge kuhl 's ruling the opinion stated emphatically a breast cancer patient who goes into an oncologist 's office to be examined does not nor should she take a risk that what goes on in the examination room will be seen or heard by anyone other than medical personnel president bush does not appear to be troubled by carolyn kuhl 's way out of the mainstream judgment in this case and in a number of others he 's nominated her to a seat on the ninth circuit court of appeals which is one step down from the supreme court as a justice department lawyer in the reagan administration ms kuhl aggressively argued for a return to the good old days before the supreme court 's roe v wade abortion decision she co wrote a supreme court brief that said roe was so far flawed that this court should overrule it and return the law to the condition in which it was before that case was decided last week the republican controlled senate judiciary committee in a strict 10 to 9 party line vote sent judge kuhl 's nomination to the senate floor democrats are fighting the nomination as part of their thankless task of trying to block at least the worst of mr bush 's judicial appointments senator charles schumer a democrat from new york who is on the judiciary committee has been trying along with many others to sound the alarm about the succession of ideologues and extremists that the president has been attempting to install in the courts during an interview last week he discussed several troubling nominations including that of james leon holmes to a federal judgeship in arkansas mr holmes has a problem with women he does n't see them as equals the wife is to subordinate herself to her husband he has written the woman in mr holmes 's view is to place herself under the authority of the man those who adopt the feminist principle of the equality of the sexes he has said are contributing to the culture of death mr holmes a lawyer is an absolute opponent of abortion even in cases of rape he once said that conception from rape occurs with approximately the same frequency as snowfall in miami he has since expressed regret for that remark even assuming they want to nominate conservative republicans said senator schumer ca n't they do better than these nominations this president has selected judges through an ideological prism to a far greater extent than any other president in history the fight over the most extreme of president bush 's judicial nominations is not a fight against his right to appoint conservatives to the bench it 's a fight to keep the courts within some kind of boundary that is reasonably close to the mainstream of american life op ed columnist e mail bobherb nytimescom
