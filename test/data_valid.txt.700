on a little downtown street here within sight of the railroad tracks is a tiny gray stucco building on its facade is a wooden six pointed star in the front yard a worn picket fence and a sign that identifies the structure as the mount kisco hebrew congregation inside the synagogue its 800 square feet are enough to impart a palpable sense of the passage of time of something that has endured for almost 100 years there are six rows of polished oak pews and a small antique crystal chandelier hanging from a brass chain there is a little ark with a velvet curtain drawn open by a simple hand held cord to reveal the holy torah there is a tiny upstairs balcony where in keeping with orthodox tradition women sit separate from men during services in the sophisticated new york suburbs where synagogues are often vast contemporary edifices of glass and metal this little synagogue and its 60 families are a testament to the vitality of a tradition that has passed from ancient times yet it is not merely nostalgia that inspires a decade ago the mount kisco hebrew congregation was on the verge of closing the original families had died off younger ones were drifting away to the conservative and reform movements by 1991 the congregation had decided to become part of a large and thriving conservative synagogue and here is where some like to say divine intervention occurred dan birenbaum an affable systems analyst and board member of mount kisco hebrew loves to tell the tale of jerome roth this wealthy young investment banker new at the time to northern westchester and newly converted to a highly observant form of judaism discovered the old congregation and decided to start a campaign to resurrect it beginning with a nighttime visit to one of its staunchest supporters so here was jerry roth dressed in a long black coat and an elegant black hat and he knocks on the door of sam smilkstein rest his soul and he tells him that he and his wife had been looking for a traditional shul a synagogue where they can worship mr birenbaum recalled mr roth offered to help organize an effort to save the synagogue contributing more than 100000 and working with mr smilkstein to raise more today mr smilkstein is dead and mr roth lives in manhattan but their efforts came to fruition and mount kisco hebrew is again vital and growing in 1991 the congregation broke ground for an 800 square foot addition to the synagogue that is almost complete a gray stucco cluster of rooms that blends seamlessly with the original building some parts are already complete still to come are new classrooms for hebrew lessons and a social hall a harold heshy wallach a retired engineer and volunteer project manager for the renovation said members have donated money through word of mouth nonmembers and local businesses contributed as well so far 350000 has been raised with 150000 still needed to complete the job and so members put on fund raising events like a purim party last weekend the party which was held at the northern westchester center for the arts featured face painting for children a magician and lots of food and there was a bit of glamour paul shaffer the musical director of late show with david letterman is a member of the congregation along with his wife cathy and their children victoria 8 and will 2 mr shaffer looked just as he does on television playing the keyboard with gusto he led a six piece band of musicians some full time professionals all of them clearly talented including lew soloff former trumpet player for blood sweat and tears and mr birenbaum who plays clarinet the band entertained with a buoyant mix of 1950 's rock 'n roll and klezmer music soulful and rhythmic brought by way of eastern europe mr shaffer explained that he lives in northern westchester loves the synagogue and is happy to play at any of its celebratory events when we moved here from manhattan and became full time suburbanites we were looking for a place to worship and we stumbled upon this lovely synagogue that took us in he said i grew up in thunder bay ontario and the only synagogue in town was orthodox although my parents were not that strictly observant i had an orthodox education the hebrew school here is wonderful for children my daughter lights the sabbath candles on friday night at home i 'm so proud of her mr shaffer also said that he loves the synagogue 's philosophy which is inclusive and embracing one does not have to observe every kosher dietary law or avoid driving on sabbath or attend every friday night and saturday morning service to feel welcome although many members are strictly observant others express their spirituality at different levels the congregation brochure explains some were raised as observant jews others are just discovering their yearnings
