if life as forrest gump said is like a box of chocolates we might consider the morgan library 's exhibition of northern european master drawings a box of truffles the 109 sheets in from bruegel to rubens netherlandish and flemish drawings all but three of which are from the library 's collection are dependably high in quality and consistently delectable and unlike edible morsels they pose no threat to the viewer 's blood sugar level this show is the first in depth look at the morgan 's holdings in netherlandish and flemish drawings in some time it includes little seen works and well known masterpieces acquired by j pierpont morgan almost all of them from his purchase of charles fairfax murray 's 1500 drawing collection in 1910 it also brings together works acquired mostly from the 1950 's to the 1980 's when the morgan was especially active in that area of collecting there are also several drawings from the thaw collection the promised gift of eugene v and clare e thaw which spans the 15th to 20th centuries and is among the largest groups of drawings to enter the morgan collection since the fairfax murray purchase even those familiar with the morgan 's exhaustive nearly three inch thick catalog of its drawings from this period published in 1991 may find their jaws dropping a bit despite the towering names in its title represented by two extraordinary drawings by bruegel in the middle of the show and a stunningly diverse string of rubenses toward the end the exhibition is dominated by artists who are less celebrated like hendrick goltzius and jacques de gheyn ii or who are unfamiliar to most viewers like cornelius cort roelandt savery and david vinckboons furthermore it opens with several anonymous works that guarantee a slow start in the best sense a selection of rare 15th century gothic drawings that includes several impressive portraits especially an electric little image of a hirsute monk by an artist known as the master of the absalom and a larger rendering of a level eyed man wearing a cap with earflaps that has some of the economy and measure of a holbein these two works and one or two others in this section are the beginning of a run of impressive portraits that extends throughout the show it culminates in the finely wrought red chalk image of a craggy old man in profile by rubens and van dyck 's quick but complete study of a woman and her daughter the young mother observes us with a reserved appraising eye that could not have been better captured with a camera of equal caliber is the cluster of netherlandish drawings of mountainous landscapes at the show 's center starting with one by bruegel and including others by cort de gheyn savery and goltzius whether a drawing or its maker qualifies as netherlandish or flemish is more a matter of time than space of chronology than geography an artist who lived and worked in antwerp in the 15th and early 16th centuries pieter bruegel for example is usually considered netherlandish but one working in the same city in the late 16th and 17th centuries rubens for example is flemish similarly an artist working in utrecht in the earlier period like abraham bloemaert is also netherlandish but one working in nearby amsterdam a century later like rembrandt is considered dutch and is not covered by this exhibition an exhibition and catalog of the morgan 's dutch drawings from the 17th to 19th centuries is being prepared the determining factor is the dutch struggle for independence during which the northern half of the region mostly the present day netherlands freed itself from spanish rule and catholicism while the southern half mostly present day belgium did not it could be argued that in 16th century europe drawing won its freedom too emerging as an independent medium with particular uses and special pleasures it was a period when technical invention and artistic innovation went hand in hand often at a fairly brisk pace as a result of gutenberg 's printing press paper had become widely available the desire for book illustrations stimulated improvements in engraving and woodblock printing as did the talents of albrecht durer this created new needs and higher standards for preparatory drawings which in turn stimulated diverse drawing techniques and styles de gheyn for example is represented here by a solid detailed image of a soldier loading a gun known as a cavalier which was a preparatory drawing for an important 16th century dutch military manual as well as by a nearly expressionistic study for a garden grotto not surprisingly the collecting of drawings had become an established practice in northern and southern europe by the end of the 16th century increasing the medium 's survival rate and inspiring the creation of highly finished technically complex masterworks a standout in this regard is bloemaert 's dramatic st roch which depicts the pilgrim saint at the crosslike intersection of a thick diagonal tree trunk and his walking staff rendered in red tempera heightened with white chalk the drawing 's forms which include an angel overhead and the saint 's loyal dog are smooth and volumetric and have the voluptuousness of marble everywhere you look in this show there are signs of change and cross fertilization of old mediums and belief systems giving way to new attributed to frans boels is a tiny jewel like mountain landscape glowing with a naturalistic sense of light and atmosphere that reflects a keen observation of nature yet the image is executed in gouache on vellum the technique perfected by manuscript illuminators there are drawings that were made as preparatory studies for engravings like de gheyn 's soldier and drawings that make the fine clear lines required of an engraving study the occasion for a virtuosic performance an example of the latter is goltzius 's large young man holding a skull and tulip an inordinately complex vanitas fantasy in brown ink face hair flower plumed hat fine clothes everything is captured in networks of parallel lines and crosshatchings of almost microscopic fineness even the shadows caught in the tiny ruffles edging the subject 's shirt turn out to be little bundles of line such over the top virtuosity might wear a viewer out if unmitigated by its opposite jan brueghel 's harbor scene described with a few spare lines reminds us that even in this period artists understood the descriptive potential of the completely bare page especially its ability to convey a sense of natural light and open space also refreshingly rough is an ink study in which rubens drew a descent from the cross and then a second smaller one over it creating a seemingly inchoate tangle that conveys the artist 's struggle first and legibility second on the wall just opposite his onetime assistant van dyck creates a similarly tangled even more explosive image in which endymion embraces diana and then embraces her again one leaves the morgan with a sense of drawing 's vastness both as energetically charted and as tantalizingly intimated by the works in this rewarding show
