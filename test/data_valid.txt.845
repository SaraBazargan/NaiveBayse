only an hour or so after vice president al gore made his televised proposal for a way to end the fracas in florida gov george w bush hit the road tonight making the 90 minute drive from his ranch near waco to the governor 's mansion here the trip was entirely unplanned and wholly rushed but the texas governor and his aides who clearly were caught by surprise recognized that he too needed to get in front of the television cameras camped nearly 100 miles away in austin they also realized that mr bush needed to do it as quickly as possible and he needed to do it right as his aides quickly composed remarks rejecting mr gore 's suggestion of a statewide manual recount in florida and a one on one meeting before the election results were known mr bush hurtled down the highway by the time he spoke about three and a half hours after mr gore had those remarks had been put on a teleprompter so mr bush could look straight into the camera and appear appropriately presidential there was tape on the floor of the governor 's mansion to show him where to walk and stand and an american flag was tucked neatly and perfectly into the backdrop he repeated his objection to manual vote counting in florida where he said there were no uniform standards for the process this means every vote in florida would be evaluated differently by different individuals using different judgment and perhaps different local standards he said this would be neither fair nor accurate it would be arbitrary and chaotic the bush campaign 's aggressive maneuvering illustrated that beyond the legal skirmishing in florida the candidates and their allies were engaged in a furious public relations war mr gore 's strike was not foreseen and mr bush had to retaliate for four days mr bush had not once stepped into public view while tonight was mr gore 's second turn before the television cameras since mr bush last faced them republicans in washington had begun to fret that mr bush and his aides were not adequately joining the battle for public opinion and mr bush 's decision over the last five days to remain in relative seclusion at his ranch far from the press corps meant that hours went by tonight before he could respond in his own voice to mr gore but when he did his words were carefully chosen and weighed he talked repeatedly about principles and fairness and accuracy and even threw in references to responsibility and dignity he mentioned mr gore only a few times dwelling instead on larger points and he implicitly cast what mr gore was doing as an effort to manipulate americans thinking and what he was doing as a defense against that the outcome of this election he said will not be the result of deals or efforts to mold public opinion the outcome of this election will be determined by the votes and by the law he said he would meet with mr gore once a winner had been declared when he finished he headed back to his ranch that decision showed just how much he wanted to be there and how keenly he felt it was important to emerge tonight earlier just minutes after mr gore 's televised remarks his most senior aides huddled for about a half hour in the office of donald l evans the campaign chairman reporters in a briefing room nearby could see the aides through transparent vertical blinds on one of the glass walls of the office mr evans was present as were karl rove the campaign 's chief strategist karen p hughes the director of communications andrew card who would probably be the white house chief of staff in a bush administration and ari fleischer and dan bartlett campaign spokesmen a republican official with ties to the bush campaign said mr bush and his aides knew they could not let mr gore whose statement fell snugly into the middle of network newscasts dominate news coverage for too long this was very good public relations the official said referring to the timing and surprise of mr gore 's television appearance they had to go into a quick reaction mode the official said and the bush campaign swiftly determined what the response would be for days james a baker iii mr bush 's chief representative in florida had made an aggressive case about the subjectivity and fallibility of hand counting bush aides said they were convinced that television viewers glimpses of the process would lead them to share the bush campaign 's belief along with its assertions that any extensive manual recount would unnecessarily prolong and complicate a resolution in the presidential race in addition they said the tally of votes from the mechanical recount put mr bush in the lead and even though his lead stands at only 300 votes campaign officials are confident mr bush will remain ahead after overseas absentee ballots are received and counted at the end of the week the results of a statewide manual recount are uncertain we do n't think it 's fair one of these officials said and we do n't think we 'd come out ahead on it until the hastily called news conference here tonight mr bush and his advisers had clearly been pursuing a strategy of separating mr bush from the legal fracas in florida and the tough words being hurled between republicans and democrats there aides also said that events there were changing so rapidly with such uncertainty that it was difficult to know what mr bush should say and questionable whether any comments he might make would be useful and meaningful it 's really a judgment call as to whether there 's something significant that he can add to the events in florida ms hughes said in a telephone interview this afternoon in addition friends of mr bush said today that he craved some rest and peace and his ranch is his favorite place ms hughes said he spent part of his day there today cutting back branches that blocked the mouth of a canyon where he and his wife laura wanted to walk he also ran conducted some state business and kept in touch with mr baker in florida and advisers in austin by both phone and e mail
