to the editor as someone from a working class family who financed her education at yale university and stanford business school with a combination of scholarships loans and jobs i think princeton 's decision to compete for students by not requiring them to borrow money is a bad idea news article jan 28 education is an investment this is especially true for ivy league graduates as they have the best opportunities to get high paying jobs it would be far better to offer loan payments spread over a longer time lower interest rates or a well designed program to forgive loans if graduates go into lower paying lines of work like academia or public service having paid my loans and having tried to be generous in gifts to my universities i see little justification to give the best and the brightest a free ride nancy c langwiser kear wellesley mass jan 29 2001
