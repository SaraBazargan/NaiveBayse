contrary to urban legend the baseball season is not over yet at the fortified castle in the bronx the way the yankees were looking last week even die hard fans were predicting their team would be holding hefty bag day when players clean out their lockers but as quickly as you can say derek sanderson jeter the yankees were back in business last night they completed their comeback by dispatching the oakland athletics 5 3 to move on to a second straight american league championship series with seattle on saturday jeter saved the season with a sensational pickup of a loose ball last night he flung himself over the fence to catch a foul pop in the eighth this was merely the first round but jeter turned it into the world series the yankees who have won three straight championships and four of the last five under manager joe torre remain alive one of these years everybody will learn their lesson and not be suckered into fretting about the yankees the a 's had seemed so captivating a few days ago they were the future young and loose and talented by last night they were merely scruffy foils for the old champs they were making errors all over the place you might say jason giambi is no tino martinez and by the fourth inning giambi was publicly yapping at miguel tejada for not taking third base on giambi 's hard single these guys were not to be confused with the old fighting a 's of the 1970 's teams that duked and feuded their way to three world championships by last night they were merely the bickering a 's goners playing the role of the texas rangers in this performance the a 's never recovered from saturday 's defensive play which will be remembered as long as fabled glove plays in the world series are remembered there have been years when epic world series games were being played on this same date exactly 32 years ago yesterday the mets and orioles played game 4 of the series it was vietnam moratorium day around the united states with millions of people humming john lennon 's words all we are saying is give peace a chance with truly vital things happening far from the ballpark rocky swoboda not hitherto associated with the words defensive and prowess made a desperate sliding catch on the right field grass of a ninth inning drive by brooks robinson that play slowed an orioles rally and set up a mets victory if that play had happened in midseason it would have been forgotten in a day it is safe to say that jeter 's play will not be forgotten jeter modestly noted that torre drilled the yankees in tracking down errant throws from the outfield but jeter compounded his marvelous reaction with an acrobatic turn and a one handed football flip to the catcher other things had to go right a superb tag by jorge posada a donkey baseball nonslide by jeremy giambi but there you have it a classic defensive moment it ranks right up there with momentous world series plays al gionfriddo on joe dimaggio in 1947 billy martin on jackie robinson in 1952 willie mays on vic wertz in 1954 brooks robinson on everybody in 1970 it was so good that an old shortstop named phil rizzuto mimicked jeter 's play last night he was supposed to make the ceremonial first pitch from the mound but he bootlegged it to the first base line and flipped it home in homage to the next yankee hall of fame shortstop last night 's game was not quite epic roger clemens who had flown home early sunday to rest his tight hamstring tried to match oakland 's mark mulder who had stayed around in case the a 's clinched they did not yankee stadium opened for business in the late afternoon sunshine with a red circus calliope tootling in the plaza it was hard not to notice new concrete traffic barriers situated strategically along the sidewalks painted a tasteful yankee blue to be sure just to hear the gates opening was a huge bonus to every yankee fan the home team had not won in four games in this series but how long could that go on the game duplicated dozens of other vital games in the past that the yankees had won with the normal lethal mix of skill character luck and make your own luck and when it was over george steinbrenner could barely hold back the tears as he raved about jeter adding that new york needed this victory jeter 's play saturday made it all possible it is only mid october much too soon for yankee seasons to end
