with the 50 50 split in the senate making dick cheney as tie breaker effectively the 101st senator some observers are asking whether he will be so tied down on capitol hill that he wo n't have enough time to participate in the new administration as an active vice president a different question however may be more important are we about to see a blurring of our traditional separation of executive and legislative powers it is the constitution of course despite its deliberate division of executive and legislative power that makes the vice president of the united states the formal president of the senate the framers themselves raised concerns about this arrangement we might as well put the president himself at the head of the legislature objected elbridge gerry george mason also warned that the vice president mixed too much the legislative and executive departments and was an encroachment of the rights of the senate but other delegates countered that stripping the vice president of his role as senate president would leave him without employment they argued that the vice president 's tie breaking power was essential for overcoming regional divisions and legislative deadlocks and in any event that power would be infrequently exercised these views and the necessity of moving on to other more controversial issues ruled the day and the provision was adopted during the presidency of george washington vice president john adams actually was a prominent force in congress he presided over the senate participated in debates in that body and helped to direct the agenda in an era with relatively little lawmaking adams cast 29 tie breaking votes keeping him at the center of the senate 's legislative business after adams vice presidents voted less frequently and assumed a greatly diminished political role eventually the senate refused to recognize vice presidents as significant legislative officers adopting rules that prevented them from addressing the senate except by unanimous consent since the early 20th century the senate has actually been guided by a complex committee system and a leadership group selected by the majority party nevertheless mr cheney as tie breaker will have considerable power his vote will be crucial in selecting that leadership group the majority leader his deputies and the committee chairmen later mr cheney may cast the decisive vote on supreme court confirmations and even in major legislative battles putting him at the very heart of policymaking the last time the senate had equal numbers of democrats and republicans in the 1950 's there were also some independent senators reducing the importance of vice president richard nixon 's tie breaking power in those days regional divisions were nearly as powerful as political ones making partisan lineups less significant than they are now in 1961 some democratic senators supported the idea of making vice president elect lyndon johnson who until then had been their leader chairman of the senate democratic caucus the proposal foundered on the objection that this would violate the separation of powers the senate could now try to protect its independence from presidential interference by yielding to democratic demands for joint committee chairmanships and shared leadership but trent lott the senate majority leader has firmly rejected this idea relying on mr cheney to secure a republican majority may be good party politics but it may also blend executive and legislative authority to a degree that is at odds with our history constitutional structure and political culture bruce g peabody is an assistant professor of political science at fairleigh dickinson university
