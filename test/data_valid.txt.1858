on a normal day jennifer capriati tends to rush through games with the haste of a short order cook moving from point to point without a pause today she was even more frenetic stir crazy and agitated after waiting through four rain delays in the wimbledon locker room she treated the changeovers of her quarterfinal match like drive through service grabbing a swig of water barely sitting down as she waited for amelie mauresmo to take her place on the worn grass courts she huffed a blown horn of sorts as if to say hurry up amelie but unlike many players mauresmo refused to let capriati dictate the pace using the allotted time she sat on the changeovers with her eyes closed in a scene straight from a yoga video the relaxation techniques left mauresmo calm and poised this was n't like her for all the potency of her swashbuckling backhand for all the rockette like kick on her serves the talented mauresmo has n't competed with a free mind in more than three years today she gave peace a chance at ease on center court mauresmo stuck to an aggressive net strategy and mixed up her slice and topspin to leave a flustered capriati helpless during a 6 3 6 2 upset in between cloudbursts second seeded serena williams also moved on to the semifinals where she 'll meet the ninth seeded mauresmo against the lanky but deceptively strong slovak teen daniela hantuchova the 11th seeded player williams was able to deliver 115 mile per hour serves on command to fend off several break point scares during her 6 3 6 2 victory a year ago williams might have folded in such a pinch maybe a dr feelgood is making the rounds at wimbledon because mauresmo has newfound confidence as well for the first time since she was a naive 19 year old finalist at the 1999 australian open she advanced past the quarterfinals of a major she 's never been as consistent as she was today said the third seeded capriati who had n't exited before a semifinal in her last seven majors usually if you can stay with her she can make a few unforced errors and kind of give you the opportunity just streaky there was none of that i was n't waiting for it to happen i was trying to play my tennis to get into it trying to stop her she was simply beaten to capriati 's credit she did n't blame a sore shoulder for her loss in fact she took the defeat well looking almost relieved that her wimbledon was over at times capriati 's second tour of her fairy tale return has left her sullen and irritable now she could go home to florida relax and regroup that did n't mean she was on the court to lose against mauresmo but on some days an opponent 's groove ca n't be decoded capriati never knew what was coming against mauresmo dealing her own brand of three card monte mauresmo kept crossing up capriati sneaking to the net standing wide to serve and maintaining the unpredictable the formula was mauresmo 's focal point with her head into the blueprint she did n't let her mind wander to the issues of panic that have sabotaged her potential over the last three years during a first round meltdown at the 2001 french open mauresmo was paralyzed by a list of fears including fear of expectation and fear of letting down her country a year ago she all but vanished from the tour unable to cope with the pain of losing in paris this year she went soul searching for a new outlook at the french open after her round of 16 exit i decided never again to put my head under water like that mauresmo said when i lost this year i let it go after three days with the support of her partner she returned to work after losing 10 pounds on a new fitness routine this season a program that includes fewer nights on the town mauresmo prepared herself for the grass courts of wimbledon when she 's on the variety of her game is suited for the grass today was proof in the sixth game of the second set mauresmo took a 30 15 lead on her opponent 's serve when she crept into the net with the stealth of a cat burglar while capriati turned to pound a forehand when she looked up there was mauresmo cutting the fuse on the powerful ground stroke with a stab volley for a winner at that moment rain began to fall for the second of three times during the match with her eyes blinking from the drops capriati hurriedly served two double faults in a row to hand a break of serve and a 4 2 lead to mauresmo i probably should have stopped capriati said that was a key time once the game ended the umpire called the players off the court suddenly they were headed to a locker room turned holding cell again i saw that she was getting upset in the locker room mauresmo said i stayed calm and i think that helped ten minutes later mauresmo came out and clung to her serve saving two break points with kick serves on the first mauresmo pulled capriati off the court as she reached for a forehand return that went wide on the second break point she left capriati lunging for a return that ricocheted off her frame mauresmo 's momentum went unabated in the second set in the fifth game mauresmo broke capriati 's serve by taking a daring forehand topspin swipe at a ball that kicked off the sideline chalk for a winner under pressure she was uncommonly cool i 'm trying to let go mauresmo said i do n't want any regrets match points the women 's semifinals will be played thursday with serena williams facing amelie mauresmo and top seeded venus williams matched against sixth seeded justine henin because of the rain delays the top seeded lleyton hewitt 's quarterfinal match against sjeng schalken of the netherlands was postponed until thursday with only 20 minutes on the court tim henman took a one set lead against andre sa of brazil before their quarterfinal match was suspended wednesday
