when nanjo masaomi receives out of town visitors these days more often than not it is to explain somewhat sheepishly why this small and sleepy rice farming town known as the cradle of japanese man no longer deserves all of the fame and attention bestowed upon it in recent years since the unearthing of stone age tools was announced here in 1993 tsukidate and its 16000 inhabitants have been at ground zero so to speak of a giddy archaeology boom in japan there have been almost monthly newspaper headlines on ever more astonishing new finds that promised to fill in the picture of early man here for a nation that has always reveled in its cultural uniqueness the discoveries were more than heartening they were almost too good to be true they meant that japan was settled more than half a million years ago which put it on a par in the antiquity scales with its perennial rival china better yet to believe the findings of the area 's star archaeologist an amateur who came to be called god 's hand by the eager news media because of his uncanny digging skills the early inhabitants were uncommonly intelligent they were capable of building tombs using colors to differentiate among tools even performing math ever since we found these colorful tools arranged neatly in a circle in the ground here said mr masaomi leader of the local board of education our idea of primitive man as someone who just wandered around eating rotten meat began to give way to another image suddenly we had a new picture of someone with some intelligence and even spiritual he said well you can imagine that this made quite a splash and for a while all people could talk about around here was the stone age with the spread of the news this town has spent a decade basking in a sort of stone age fever flintstone like characters became mascots of the town which adopted a motto that had the ring of clever advertising come see the skies that were admired by the original man so it was not long before tourists were flocking here by the thousands to gaze at dig sites carved into the area 's rolling hills soon there were original man noodle shops the original man way a road its shoulders planted with brilliant marigolds that snakes through the forested foothills at town 's edge and an original man marathon which quickly became a popular annual event drawing runners from all over japan but just as surely as the town 's fame was fueled by eager press coverage and screaming headlines so was its downfall in november the daily mainichi shimbun shocked its readers with three front page photographs showing the pioneering archaeologist behind the town 's discoveries shinichi fujimura planting the supposedly ancient tools at his dig site forced to confess after being caught in the act recently on film apparently after colleagues tipped off the press mr fujimura apologized to his professional peers and to the public for having frequently planted artifacts during his career both near this town and elsewhere in japan asked why he answered tearfully the devil made me do it the fujimura scandal has cast a harsh light on a scientific establishment that often lends itself to the national effort of enhancing japan 's sense of uniqueness state and local governments for example have spent huge amounts of money to underwrite the search for early man while ignoring questions about japanese identity ancient imperial tombs remain officially closed to researchers many here say because they might contain evidence linking the imperial lineage to neighboring korea the fact that supposed finds as dramatic as those of mr fujimura were received and celebrated without peer review and even without a scientific dating of the artifacts themselves has caused rare soul searching among laymen and scientists alike the objects did not even look authentic in a scathing editorial in the yomiuri shimbun one of japan 's top archaeologists toshiki takeoka denounced the credulousness of his compatriots and the scientific establishment if scholars remain content with believing in some psychic ability of a certain individual or go along with bizarre phenomena without question he wrote then we must ask ourselves what sort of academic discipline we are dealing with mr takeoka said that he had written of his concerns earlier but that academic journals had edited out his most serious reservations others have focused on the damage that the fraud has inflicted on the credibility of the country 's teaching establishment and textbooks there are checks still taking place at all of the 33 sites where mr fujimura worked but already the textbook companies are having to rewrite their histories said shizuo ono chief curator at the cultural affairs department of the tokyo metropolitan government in the classrooms of high school and junior high school teachers have been teaching about these sites with pride as the nation 's oldest site i 've read letters to the editor where teachers have said that they 've been hurt because they 've been accused of lying by their students meanwhile for the town that built its reputation on the idea of being the home of the original man the revelations have brought a need for adjustments what will they do about all of the stone age motifs and original man events this regrettable incident aside we still take comfort in some finds by other diggers in this area mr masaomi said for the time being we will continue to believe that we have some connection to ancient man but frankly speaking we are all hoping that the experts will prove that the other sites are genuine then before bidding farewell to his visitors he urged be sure to try some of our original man noodles
