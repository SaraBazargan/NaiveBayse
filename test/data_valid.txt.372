jeffrey immelt president and chairman elect of general electric says his company 's chances of merging with honeywell another electronics and aircraft technology giant have virtually evaporated though the interested parties are two american companies and american regulators have approved the deal the european commission is blocking the union because of its perceived potential for dampening competition in global markets if ge and honeywell were to go ahead without the commission 's approval fines or bars to selling could result we support the right of foreign governments especially those of developing countries to regulate american businesses that take dominant market positions in their jurisdictions but the europeans have not explained their position except to say that airlines which have kept mum through the deal 's review share their concerns moreover a collapse in this case will cast a dark shadow over corporate activity in the future the european commission 's first concern is that ge would acquire a popular supplier of components to other engine makers opening the door to destructive gouging of competitors the merged company might also bundle honeywell avionics technology with ge engines this practice could force buyers of ge engines to accept honeywell avionics or at least lead to low package deal rates that might force companies selling only avionics or engines out of the market though ge expected to make some concessions to assuage these fears it did not guess that this merger would provoke a formidable legal threat in one of its biggest markets the source of this surprise is the european union 's competition policy which is full of contradictory goals its vague language on encouraging innovation while protecting consumers and national champion businesses makes it hard for companies contemplating mergers to anticipate where the ec will see threats to free markets the policy also prescribes few specific ways of judging anti competitive pressures as a result the ec has usually taken a flexible approach to decision making consisting of several rounds of analysis and back and forth negotiating with the parties involved ge whose team has been leading the negotiations had prepared itself for this process it offered concessions such as selling off portions of honeywell 's aerospace business worth 22 billion in revenues annually and turning its own aircraft leasing arm into an independently managed but ge owned company but the commission 's last counteroffer asked for almost total divestiture of honeywell 's avionics business and scaled down ownership of the leasing arm the ec 's demands would supposedly protect airlines and aircraft makers which would suffer the most if a single company dominated the aircraft engine and avionics markets yet airlines have not corroborated the ec 's concerns in public and two leading aircraft makers boeing and airbus both support the merger if when they meet next monday the ec 's regulators confirm their preliminary ruling against the deal american companies will take it as a high profile signal to change their behavior corporate boards will be more likely to think twice before undertaking mergers that affect europe 's markets american companies will also shy away from big investments in europe if down the road its regulators might torpedo mergers that would create value in the united states and elsewhere that would give the ec 's actions a perverse result discouraging american players and actually harming competition in european markets on this side of the atlantic congress and the white house must be careful not to overreact president bush 's antitrust team is more sympathetic to big mergers than bill clinton 's was so the commission 's action strikes a stronger contrast than it might have only a year ago but taking legislative action to retaliate against european companies in the united states as senator jay rockefeller suggested his subcommittee on aviation might would go too far a disagreement on the fate of one merger should not disrupt what has in the past been more of a cooperative relationship on regulation if the commission has acted in a way that restrains trade without helping competition then declining foreign investment and higher prices for aircraft technology will be punishment enough
