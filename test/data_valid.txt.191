when he was called from the bench late in the third quarter of game 3 on sunday night lucious harris seemed almost unrecognizable as he entered the game he had shed the clear plastic mask that he had worn since returning from a broken bone on the right side of his face just before the playoffs he was hoping to cast off the shooting woes that had plagued him throughout the nba finals but the new look did nothing to alter the slump that has hit harris at the most inopportune time he was 1 for 5 from the floor sunday night against the lakers a step up from the 1 for 14 he was shooting in the series entering game 3 when he took the floor in the third quarter his appearance coincided with the nets most effective stretch of the series as they connected on 10 straight shots but harris did not take any of them his was the 11th shot the one that ended the streak then after the nets scored on four straight possessions harris tried again this time on a runner in the lane and it missed he put up one more shot that missed as coach byron scott kept him on the floor hoping harris could recapture his form but a 7 point nets lead had dissipated to 1 by the time harris was pulled with 5 minutes 13 seconds to play in the game which the lakers won 106 103 i am empathizing with lucious because he 's been great all season long scott said he has a slump at the worst possible time i feel for him in the locker room last night he was devastated but i left him in there for a couple of reasons i know as a shooter you know he 's going to come out of it no 2 he was doing a good job on the defensive end in our zone he was doing things among the things harris decided to do was discard a mask that he really had not needed in recent weeks but had continued to wear as a good luck charm after i missed three shots i was like let me try something different harris said maybe the mask is bad luck right now he said he was certain he would not wear the mask in game 4 it 's retired harris said it should have been retired for game 1 that was quick aaron williams 's struggles in game 3 occurred at a much faster pace than lucious harris 's drawn out nightmare williams trying to defend shaquille o'neal while surrendering 4 inches and 75 pounds entered the nba finals record book in ignominious fashion fouling out in just 7 minutes 12 seconds of action williams entered the game with 5 04 remaining in the first quarter and it took him just 25 seconds to pick up his first foul hacking kobe bryant under the basket williams then held o'neal just 32 seconds later he drew his third foul hacking o'neal on a layup giving williams three fouls in 2 27 williams sat for the entire second and third quarters taking the floor again to start the fourth quarter he lasted 1 19 this time before fouling bryant with 9 02 left williams fouled o'neal after o'neal grabbed an offensive rebound byron scott elected to leave williams on the floor with five fouls and he lasted another 1 47 before fouling o'neal again nevertheless williams earned an ovation from the continental arena crowd for his efforts as he departed with 7 15 remaining a couple of the calls i did n't agree with but probably four of them were legit fouls williams said of his wrestling match with o'neal what are you going to do he 's a big guy
