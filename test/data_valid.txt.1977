valerie ujueta lives less than 20 feet from linden hill cemetery in queens it 's the only house on the block a place where from time to time black cats can be seen chasing each other up and down the stairs it 's peaceful nobody bothers us she said to outsiders the house may seem haunted and the woman who lives there in some ways she is for ms ujueta abandonment and loss have been running themes in a 43 year life she has been widowed twice and after the sept 11 attacks she lost a job at a company that sorted mail for the world trade center the work helped pay the bills for her and her six children jastin 18 gisselle 17 jordan 12 jilliann 11 joshua 10 and jeremy 8 but there is one thing ms ujueta refuses to lose her hope for a brighter future aided by agencies supported by the new york times neediest cases fund she is trying hard to keep the ghosts at bay ms ujueta 's resilience was born of hardship her first husband jastin and gisselle 's father died she returned to queens and rented the house near the cemetery renovating cleaning and painting the inside herself in 1987 she remarried to carlos ujueta who did computer repairs she had four more children with him the ujuetas had planned to drive to orlando the month mr ujueta died in 1996 of a brain aneurysm they were going to take the children to disney world and maybe even move to florida instead ms ujueta was left to care for the six children ms ujueta was determined to keep her family together although her husband 's relatives suggested that the children might be better off with them she told her brother ronnie tringali 'i 'm not giving them away she remembered to me they 're all i really have she said looking at four of the children who had joined her in their home they 're everything to me ms ujueta had the support of her brother but he fell ill in 1995 and ms ujueta cared for him until he died in 1997 she took a job at global research distribution in queens where she worked nights sorting financial mail going to and from the trade center ms ujueta received merit raises after three months and more raises and responsibilities followed so did 9 11 ms ujueta was preparing her children for school on sept 11 when she saw the holes that had been ripped in the buildings across the river they all watched the towers collapse but i saw this never thinking it would affect my job she said my whole world fell apart her company found itself forced to cut costs ms ujueta was laid off though eligible for disaster relief funds from the red cross she has not been able to find steady work since sept 12 2001 ms ujueta makes purses out of burlap and the legs of old jeans selling them for 10 to make ends meet but it has not been enough her grandmother who is 91 sends her money when she can and the children help her around the house but caring for her children and trying to find work are difficult and she no longer receives disaster unemployment benefits the red cross gave her a phone number for the brooklyn bureau of community service one of seven agencies that receive money from the neediest cases fund ms ujueta called and spoke with diana naftal a social worker at the agency 's atlantic avenue office with winter approaching the agency gave 600 to ms ujueta to buy each child a new coat and a new pair of boots it also gave her 308 to pay her three month old phone bill catholic charities another agency that receives funding from neediest cases gave her 486 to prevent her electricity from being turned off what impressed me most was that she made this vow to herself that she 'd always be there for her kids ms naftal said through all this she 's been a normalizing presence she 's made it ok for them they know that she can do that she 's willing to do anything ms ujueta is benefiting from ms naftal 's agency in other ways intent on changing her life she is learning how to write a resume and is registering for computer classes gisselle wants to be a beautician and is looking into taking classes and ms ujueta has been enrolling the children in after school activities ms ujueta has begun working for a cousin who owns a beauty salon in merrick on long island sweeping the floors and washing hair three days a week while continuing to look for work elsewhere she also dreams of renting a house from her in bellmore there ms ujueta hopes her daughter will not have to worry about being harassed by gangs and the children will be able to attend better schools and all those ghosts may seem a little farther away it made all the difference to have somebody on my side she said how
