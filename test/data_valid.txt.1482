rosie o'donnell soldiers on but now without her rosie the magazine she must have abandoned it with fathomless sorrow just as i with great regret must announce my decision to step away from tim the tim magazine effective immediately the editorial autonomy i had been led to expect has been gradually stripped from me and i no longer feel that the magazine represents the true tim experience sharp eyed readers may have noticed that the current cover story tim what 's his problem departed from the largely tim positive stories the magazine had run in its first year i have no desire to rehash the events that brought us to this pass but i would like to correct certain misconceptions that have been spread in the press while it is true that i wanted to be featured less prominently on the magazine 's covers it is not true that i provoked a roll around on the floor catfight with kelly ripa during a recent cover shoot in order to ruin the photo she provoked it regarding our article chums who chatter about male gossip with the benefit of hindsight we might have been more diligent about confirming the identity of the article 's author but when dorothy parker says she wants to write a story for you you publish first and ask questions later some critics seemed determined not to get the magazine they derided it as for instance too simple minded one example often cited in the press was our recipe for scrumptious devil 's food cake a la tim buy cake mix of your choice prepare according to directions on box or just buy a cake or do n't to them i will explain yet again that our governing ethos was one of ease and yes laziness you want a recipe that starts with grinding cocoa beans that 's what martha stewart living is for still the critics were right about one thing the three part series about the history of three part series may have been too meta for its own good the nude photo atop the editor 's letter was not my idea while this ending is a sad one we 'd prefer to dwell on the magazine 's achievements rather than its demise while tim may soon be gone from newsstands i feel confident that many of its innovations the pop up celebrity profiles the inserted razor blade samples the random pagination the special sprechen sie deutsch all german issue the extra large edition for giants the free puppy with every subscription will live on elsewhere in closing i 'd like to thank our loyal subscribers for sticking with the magazine for as long as they did mom dad you 're the best tim carvell is a senior editor at sports illustrated women
