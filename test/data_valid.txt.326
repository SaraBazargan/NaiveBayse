the islanders seized a one goal lead tonight against the toronto maple leafs and then tried to sit on it for the next 54 minutes even for a team that has waited eight years to get back to the playoffs 54 minutes is an awfully long time to kill the islanders spent most of the last two periods retreating instead of trying to score again and the maple leafs punched through their tiring defense for a pair of third period goals in a five minute span and a 3 1 victory in game 1 of their first round playoff series at air canada center game 2 of the four of seven game series is here saturday afternoon the islanders acknowledged that they would have to shoot more than they did tonight if they wanted to return home with a split they were outshot 31 14 and took only eight shots in the first two periods we 've got to learn that the playoffs are won in the trenches not by floating around islanders goaltender chris osgood said we 've got to go to the net the islanders took the lead less than six minutes into the game on a power play goal by defenseman kenny jonsson whose last postseason game was in 1995 with the maple leafs he slapped in the rebound of a shot by aleksei yashin past toronto goaltender curtis joseph but the islanders appeared satisfied with that it was so uncharacteristic of a team that earned most of its 42 regular season victories by being relentless the islanders won a game late in the season against boston by playing keepaway but coach peter laviolette said this was not the plan tonight we did n't come here and do what we were supposed to do laviolette said the islanders did play robust defense and their penalty killing unit kept toronto from getting good chances but the maple leafs tied the game 4 minutes 3 seconds into the third period on a goal by darcy tucker travis green a former islander plucked a loose puck from the boards to the right of osgood and fired it toward the goal tucker was covered by defenseman eric cairns but he tipped the puck with enough force that it slid past osgood we threw it at the net and made good things happen toronto coach pat quinn said tie domi gave the maple leafs the lead 4 36 later on another deflected goal toronto kept the puck in the islanders zone for a while and domi who had nine goals this season flipped a soft shot at osgood it appeared to be going wide but kicked off the stick of islanders wing kip miller and past osgood at 8 39 it was the second goal in 48 playoff games for domi mats sundin added an empty net goal with 40 seconds left toronto wing shayne corson who was again effective shadowing yashin received a 10 minute match penalty as time expired at the end of the game for hitting islanders center dave scatchard with his stick national hockey league officials will review corson 's actions friday and could suspend him but the islanders first playoff game since april 24 1994 was a lost cause by then asked if the islanders might have been too nervous jonsson said i think we were more excited we wanted to do too much they knew what was at stake and they had a 3 0 0 1 record against toronto this season but as the game went on the islanders seemed to join the 19438 in attendance joseph can stop shots if no one is creating a traffic jam around him we did n't even take perimeter stuff laviolette said yashin who was questionable to play until minutes before the game because of a strained groin muscle had one assist equaling his playoff output of the last two seasons combined but none of his three shots came in the third period domi known more for his punching ability than his scoring punch had four shots in the period tonight it was kind of like one guy skating and the other four guys watching islanders defenseman adrian aucoin said not at the beginning twenty two seconds after the islanders first power play began jonsson fired the puck into the toronto zone and it hit a panel of glass at the end of the ice shattering it play was delayed for nine minutes the delay could have killed the islanders momentum but they scored 45 seconds after play resumed joseph went way back into his net to stop jonsson 's shot but it went past him at 5 57 it was the first playoff goal of jonsson 's career but toronto got feistier as the first period went on to me they picked up their game and we did n't osgood said somehow the islanders got through the rest of the first period and all of the second playing a style that was foreign to laviolette the first two periods were pretty boring to me honestly he said
