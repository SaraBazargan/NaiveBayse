the international olympic committee has seemingly been playing catch up for years with athletes who use sophisticated means to mask their use of steroids human growth hormone erythropoietin or epo and other performance enhancing drugs now through the world anti doping agency the ioc wants to anticipate the possibility that athletes will begin re engineering certain genes to strengthen their muscles increase their oxygen carrying capacity block their pain or speed their pace of healing from injury the best way to deal with it is to prevent it and move quickly to the forefront of the technology dick pound the anti doping agency 's chairman said yesterday in manhattan after a conference on genetic enhancement in athletics at cold spring harbor ny that was attended by scientists sports officials educators and ethicists the use of drugs and perhaps more startling the engineering of genes to enhance performance raises questions about the notion of what an athlete is is he the product of his genetic makeup environment and training or can he add to his natural stew with the latest in scientific advances pound a former olympic swimmer and longtime ioc member said sports are designed by people for people people are not designed for a particular sport still that purism has been tainted by drug use altering genes appears to represent the latest temptation research into genetic therapy for legitimate medical purposes has been taking place for years with only limited success so far pound said there was no evidence that the emerging genetic technology had been used by athletes some experts wonder though if illicit efforts are under way to harness the emerging techniques for athletics it 's impossible to say there is n't clandestine work in genetics going on said theodore friedmann professor of pediatrics at the university of california 's center for molecular genetics in san diego christopher evans director of the center for molecular orthopedics at harvard medical school raised the question a different way could a rogue person be doing this in his basement he said probably pound suggested that genetic enhancement could be widespread among athletes within five years underscoring the need to develop ways of detecting such abuse before it occurs the scientific and sports communities are faced with a dilemma the same genetic transfer techniques that would be used for legitimate medical therapies think of an anterior cruciate ligament that does not tear when a ton 's worth of defensive linemen tackle a running back could also be used illicitly how do we distinguish enhancement from treatment said joseph glorioso director of the pittsburgh human gene therapy center at the university of pittsburgh athletes should have rights of access to therapies but we have to control the length of expression of the gene and that will take a lot of judgment friedmann said therapy and enhancement were part of a continuum in which a genetic treatment to heal a short term injury could also lead to the long term enhancement of the athlete 's genetic makeup
