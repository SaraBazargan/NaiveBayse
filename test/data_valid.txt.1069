teachers are not the only ones in short supply in the nation 's schools superintendents and school boards are increasingly finding themselves scrambling when it is time to fill job vacancies at higher levels many teachers are reluctant to step up to an administrative position with more responsibility pressure and accountability often for little more than they are already being paid when eastchester sought a 150000 superintendent only 40 candidates applied compared with twice that when the job became vacant in 1991 in ardsley where a high school principal will be needed in the next academic year the district decided to shuffle current administrators moving the middle school principal to the high school shifting the middle school assistant principal into the top job there and offering the assistant principal position at the middle school to the elementary school 's current assistant principal a new program the future school administrators academy begun last september at the putnam northern westchester board of cooperative educational services is designed to ease the shortage of administrators by helping districts develop candidates from their own teaching staff this really started when putnam and northern westchester superintendents got together and started talking about the small pool of candidates out there said dr marjorie e castro superintendent of the croton harmon school district in croton on hudson and a faculty member of the program the candidates for principals or district positions were not of the quality we hoped to see and we were really worried leadership is key as renee gargano deputy superintendent for the putnam northern westchester board of cooperative education and co director of the future school administrators academy said we were realizing the school districts problem in attracting outstanding administrative candidates it 's both a quality and a quantity issue as a boces we felt it incumbent on us to do something to have a direct effect on the problem with 62 percent of the state 's superintendents eligible to retire in the next five years and superintendents averaging less than five years in the job the need to identify train and recruit future educational leaders is critical the future school administrators academy is a partnership made up of the putnam northern westchester board 14 school districts and teachers college at columbia university the two year program offers the 23 candidates internships academic classes and mentoring as a way of earning a certificate of advanced study from teachers college and new york state certification as a school district administrator districts nominate candidates they feel would benefit from this program and will become able and willing administrators the participants share the cost of the program with the sponsoring districts and serve 600 hours as administrative interns for their home districts the program 's fee of 13500 also reflects a one third reduction in tuition at teachers college dr thomas sobol a professor of education at teachers college and co director of the program said that a significant factor is that the program sponsors solicited the participation of the students we tapped terrific teachers and aggressively recruited them he said we are not waiting for them to apply debi cagliostro who trains teachers in new instructional methods for kindergarten through eighth grade in the yorktown school district said that the prodding helped i was more resistant at the beginning said mrs cagliostro who is particularly enthusiastic about the professional network that has developed from the program i thought of administrative work as more bureaucratic before but i 'm more interested now the program focuses on the role of a leader and how you define it it opens the door to many possibilities education is at the brink of so many reforms now i 'd be looking to any kind of position to help people move and change in instructional reform although the local school districts sponsor the candidates the goal is broader than merely developing local administrators the idea is not necessarily to have the administrators back in their own districts but to have them available for the region dr castro said we want to get a pool out there in our own districts we try to identify outstanding people who have leadership qualities camille banks an english teacher in ossining who has been working at the anne m dorner middle school for the last seven years was eager to sign up i have always aspired to be in education she said i never saw myself as only a classroom teacher but as someone more as a driving force for change the courses are geared toward the idea of being an innovator being a trail blazer i 'm concerned with achievement gaps particularly for minority students and for that reason it is not enough to be a teacher i 've already been changed and i feel capable of making change i have a deeper desire to help the educationally disadvantaged randy howe a special education teacher who works in a program for teenage mothers for the putnam northern westchester cooperative education board is also eager to pursue an administrative career track it seemed like a natural progression to me mr howe said but the fact is that becoming an administrator is no longer a natural progression from being a teacher most of us in the program want to stay in touch with the kids but we also want to make some positive changes it 's important to keep folks coming into administrative positions the program 's emphasis on case studies internships and practical problem solving offers another distinction there 's a perennial see saw in the colleges and graduate schools between theory and practice dr sobol said we 're going to begin and end with problems and practices the idea is to immerse the students in practical situations and apply theory some teachers however are still not completely sold on the idea myrna harris a special education teacher in the hendrick hudson school district said i have become more and more involved in district initiatives and had an interest in being a leader i had absolutely no aspiration to become an administrator i love teaching i did have an interest in seizing the opportunity they offered me to be a leader and a change agent whatever direction i take this program will make me a better educator
