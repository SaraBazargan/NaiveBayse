paul hough 's video documentary the backyard opens today at the cinema village but it probably belongs in the american museum of natural history 's annual margaret mead film and video festival it 's an astounding anthropological study of that strange tribe known as the american teenager mr hough 's subject is the middle american phenomenon known as backyard wrestling in which young men emulate the bloody high jinks of professional wrestlers using decidedly amateur means homemade rings built out of mattresses and tarps homemade weapons usually involving barbed wire wrapped around a club or a board and homemade gore here created as the professional wrestlers do by cutting their own foreheads with hidden razor blades it 's a technique that produces maximum blood with minimum pain mr hough son of the british horror film director john hough twins of evil tours the united states seeking out the local backyard scene in towns from california to upstate new york a side trip to england where mr hough finds another mutation of the form is an unexpected bonus in their crude backyard arenas the wrestlers most of whom appear to be 16 or 17 beat the heck out of each other or at least appear to do so before crowds of appreciative fans that generally number in the high single digits the film focuses on one aging adolescent known professionally as the lizard who is said in his 30 's to be the oldest wrestler in the scene his dream is to make it to the world wrestling federation the league that operates much of the wrestling on cable television he talks in the go for it cliches of the rocky films and their many descendants you 've got to have heart devotion and dedication to the business he says shortly before diving head first into a table and smashing it though he 's a skinny sad looking figure the lizard refuses to acknowledge that he might not make his goal of being somebody he has a bedroom filled with what looks to be hundreds of plastic action figures collectible dolls of various action heroes and wrestlers his dream is to have an action figure of his own the backyard is often hard to watch given the level of hideous mayhem that seems to be standard for these performances though much of it is faked there also appears to be a very high rate of masochism among the participants as if backyard wrestling were the male symptom analogous to cutting or purging among teenage girls it releases tension but at a considerable price the most poignant figures in the film are a pair of brothers who have constructed an elaborate scenario they call the three stages of hell in the course of their performance they beat each other with crutches and chairs wrapped with barbed wire try to bury the other in a grave six feet deep and do some terrifying throwdowns on a burning plank tied with barbed wire and laced with light tubes the older boy later explains to mr hough that the performance is a metaphor for his childhood during which he was ritually abused by his father violence he says calmly was his father 's way of expressing his love the three stages of hell is his way of recapturing that experience at times the dialogue captured by mr hough seems to be almost too good to be true as when a skinhead wrestler approvingly says of a match it 's just like going downtown and gay bashing but this stuff is much too strange and much too disturbing to be invented even by the son of the director of the legend of hell house the backyard directed edited and produced by paul hough director of photography paul highlander music by sj released by hiqi media and image entertainment at the cinema village 22 east 12th street greenwich village running time 78 minutes this film is not rated with the lizard scar chaos the retarded butcher and sic
