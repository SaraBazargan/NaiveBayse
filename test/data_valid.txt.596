with the widening of television 's reach every oddity of american life can have its day on screen and probably will as the mass medium learns to exploit the fringe for cable networks finding a common denominator has become less important than divining which arcane enthusiasm will spark the imagination of a generation accustomed to channel surfing until it hits something unusual witness the success of battlebots a bizarre televised contest in which robots operated by remote control try to destroy each other as a live audience cheers since its debut in august this techie transmutation of cockfights and tractor pulls has become the second most popular program on comedy central after its wednesday night lead in south park with an average audience of 16 million battlebots will move to tuesdays beginning dec 5 cultural phenomena are fabricated quickly these days so the robot contestants along with their human creators and operators almost instantly appeared on network television giving demo matches on the tonight show the segment ended with jay leno screaming i love this i want to build my own robot which he did he and his bot chin killa were scheduled to compete in a battlebots exhibition in las vegas yesterday mr leno 's stunt illustrates how perfectly this mechanized meta sport merges traditional television 's celebration of violent sport boxing wrestling football with today 's ironic sensibility which has become the defining characteristic of comedy central this is a slightly nerd sport said deborah liebling the channel 's senior vice president of new programming and development if we 're going to have a sport this is it the battlebots ethos of violence without blood or sweat also fits into a cultural shift toward technological distancing which became apparent during the gulf war a conflict that was conveyed on television as a video game in battlebots the robots attack each other with a ferocity and assortment of weaponry including buzz saws and spikes that would be terrifying if flesh rather than metal were on the line they battle for three minutes less if there 's a knockout in an arena called the battlebox its sides are made of shatterproof glass to protect the audience from flying parts and to shield the meek looking robot owners who stand outside the box as they manipulate their proxies with hand held controls the floor contains 14 hazards including sledgehammers ramrods and more buzz saws that pop up periodically and try to dismantle the robots before their opponents can comedy central stages battlebots as a campy version of a traditional sports match with two announcers sputtering the play by play and field reporters interviewing the winners and losers in one feature a man describes the pleasures of creating robots in his basement go down there turn on the lights drink a bunch of cokes eat a bunch of fudge and mm 's and then work on the robot all night like human fighters the robots are classified by weight in four categories from lightweight 25 87 pounds to super heavyweight 316 488 pounds bill nye the science guy offers breathless technical commentary and nontechnical hyperbole this bot is dressed to impress distress and destroy all challengers battlebots grew out of live robot competitions begun in san francisco in 1994 by marc thorpe a former model maker at george lucas 's industrial light and magic called robot wars these gladiator style contests celebrated engineering ingenuity and the weird obsessiveness of people willing to spend years and thousands of dollars developing a robot that could be destroyed in three minutes or less though an occasional cute anthropomorphic robot showed up most of the combatants looked like mischievous science fair projects piles of junk containing clever destructive capabilities a robot named tentoumushi designed by a 14 year old girl is one of the cute ones resembling a ladybug until its red shell lifts and reveals a hook that can be lowered to trap its opponent others have names like mauler and toecrusher which was named for its dominant feature a dagger like protrusion at the end of a metal arm that slams down on command the robot wars competitions were briefly an annual ritual in geek saturated northern california until they were shut down because of litigation between business partners meanwhile bbc 2 developed a program also called robot wars and in this country edward trey roski son of a los angeles real estate developer and his cousin greg munson decided to revive the san francisco competitions calling them battlebots with the idea of selling tickets on pay per view television though the pay per view programs did n't attract many viewers they attracted the right one comedy central 's ms liebling who appreciated the humor as well as the violence in the contests and also understood the attraction of technology to young audiences the median age for battlebots viewers is 27 scientists and special effects people are making the robots but so are people who are 12 years old she said i do n't think there 's as big a gap in how techno savvy people are i think we 're in a culture where machines are much more acceptable to all of us certainly watching machines being created or destroyed an idea that dates at least to the swiss artist jean tinguely 's self destructing contraptions in the 1950 's and 60 's has become an acceptable form of television entertainment mtv has been developing a version of the british robot wars and the sci fi channel has a program called robodeath in the works tlc has produced an american version of the british program called junkyard wars in which teams compete to see who can build the best machine out of discarded scraps so do n't throw away that old blender it may have its own cable series soon
