facing potential restrictions on a major ingredient in some of their best known brands pharmaceutical companies staunchly defended the safety of their products yesterday and accused the food and drug administration of placing an unwarranted amount of faith in what they called a questionable study manufacturers of over the counter drugs that contain the ingredient phenylpropanolamine commonly found in decongestants and appetite suppressants said they had no plans to take the products off the market despite new evidence that it could increase the risk of stroke in young women drawing from a five year study at yale university that is the largest ever conducted on the health effects of the substance a panel of experts convened by the agency recommended on wednesday that the ingredient be barred from over the counter medications every year americans spend hundreds of millions of dollars to consume billions of doses of products containing phenylpropanolamine including alka seltzer dexatrim dimetapp and triaminic scientists hired to review the study by the consumer healthcare products association the industry 's main trade group called it inconclusive and said it drew from an insignificant pool of cases of the 702 stroke victims in the study for example six were found to have used an appetite suppressant yet only one in a control group of nearly 1400 had taken a similar product too few they argued from which to draw any meaningful insight it 's not a very robust test of a hypothesis said dr charles h hennekens a former professor of medicine at harvard who was hired by the industry to review the findings it was unfortunate that people accepted this like it was the gospel although the drug agency has received only 44 reports of strokes tied to phenylpropanolamine in the last 30 years agency officials estimate that more than 200 such incidents occur each year since over the counter medications are taken without a doctor 's oversight the drug agency says few doctors identify phenylpropanolamine as a factor in strokes moreover manufacturers of nonprescription drugs are not typically required to report adverse health reactions making it hard to keep track of actual illnesses the industry 's consumer products association proposed a number of alternatives to a ban on thursday at the meeting where the panel recommended the restrictions those proposals include stricter labeling and additional studies but until the agency actually prohibits the use of phenylpropanolamine many manufacturers said they did not intend to replace the substance or start special campaigns to allay consumer fears we 're confident that we could put a new product on the shelf that does n't contain it rather quickly said francis sullivan spokesman for williams whitehall robins health care the division of american home products for nonprescription drugs where sales of dimetapp and robitussin have exceeded 130 million in the past year but for now advertising is status quo manufacturers said that they can replace phenylpropanolamine with pseudoephedrine an active ingredient in many other nonprescription cold and cough remedies that would require little more than a reformulation to preserve the product 's taste yet many companies contend that such a move would be premature considering that a final ruling by the drug agency is still weeks away industry officials say they support a coordinated but voluntary reporting system of reporting illnesses but contend that a regular survey of their members turns up an average of just two reports of stroke from phenylpropanolamine each year only slightly more than what the drug agency has found many of these illnesses the consumer products association says are in people who take more than the recommended dose particularly with appetite suppressants hoping it will expedite results in response the industry is now pushing for uniform labeling on phenylpropanolamine products under the proposal consumers would be warned not to use more than one medication with the ingredient at a time and told in bold letters across the packaging that increasing the dose can be dangerous the drug agency has been looking at making such instructions mandatory since 1996 but as part of a compromise with the industry until the study was completed they have remained voluntary some manufacturers have followed them
