to the editor re victims of gas say swift death for hussein would be too merciful news article dec 18 in march 1988 when these dreadful attacks which resulted in the deaths of 5000 took place saddam hussein was vigorously supported by the united states despite knowledge of the gas attacks the united states continued to support iraq 's regime until the invasion of kuwait in 1990 and today we still support a number of brutal dictatorships like saudi arabia 's let 's hope that this and future administrations will recognize that supporting oppressive dictatorships in addition to being morally corrupt can ultimately cost a great deal even if the support appears to be in our strategic or economic best interests at the time if we are truly concerned about oppressed people worldwide we should demand that such regimes change their ways before we help create another monster and before we find it necessary to launch another military assault howard monaghan kendall park nj dec 18 2003
