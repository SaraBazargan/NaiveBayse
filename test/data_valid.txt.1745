for rutgers to beat princeton it had to slow judson wallace a junior center who was averaging 228 points a game eighth best in the nation obviously that message got through saturday rutgers forced wallace into a miserable afternoon and escaped with a 51 49 victory there is little doubt that one had a lot to do with the other wallace was held to 5 points made only 1 of 8 attempts from the floor had 6 turnovers and drew a technical the result of his frustration with no other tiger capable of filling the void left by wallace 's uncharacteristically poor performance rutgers was able to do just enough to improve its record to 5 1 we just had a night like tonight where the shots were n't falling and the center was playing like excrement said wallace who called his performance the worst of his collegiate career considering how poorly wallace played rutgers probably can not feel too good about beating an ivy league team by 2 points but the scarlet knights at least showed a bit of toughness making key defensive stops late and making their free throws when they counted most princeton which opened the game with an 8 0 run pecked away at a rutgers lead once as high as 9 points through most of the second half the tigers trailed by only 45 43 when andre logan scored on a put back with 4 minutes 39 seconds remaining the scarlet knights made four consecutive foul shots to cling to their lead before quincy douby missed the front end of a one and one with 63 seconds left that gave princeton a chance to go ahead or tie the score but an open jumper by logan from the foul line was short our kids sat down and played hard defensively said rutgers coach gary waters whose team was led by ricky shields 's 13 points a year ago we would have lost this game it would n't even have been close it was hardly a stellar offensive performance from rutgers but there was nothing wrong with the team 's defense princeton 4 2 which had been shooting 532 percent from the floor was held to 422 percent and made only 5 of 21 3 point attempts it was not more physical than we are used to princeton coach john thompson iii said they play very good defense but it was n't necessarily the defense it was one of those days temple 67 penn state 56 david hawkins scored 25 points for host temple 2 4 against penn state 3 4 which got 17 points from deforrest riley smith despite shooting 20 percent from the field in the second half and going 11 minutes 1 second without a field goal the owls beat the nittany lions by forcing 19 turnovers ap seton hall 91 st peter 's 62 andre barrett had 20 points 8 rebounds and 7 assists to lead host seton hall john allen added 18 points to help the pirates 4 2 beat st peter 's 4 2 for the eighth consecutive time keydren clark who was averaging 258 points scored 32 for the peacocks ap fdu 76 long island 73 the sophomore gordon klaiber scored a career high 26 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead fairleigh dickinson 3 3 1 0 northeast conference past host long island university 3 4 0 2 ap stony brook 70 hofstra 69 d j munir scored 13 of his 27 points in a 21 8 second half rally that lifted stony brook 3 3 over host hofstra 3 5 ap west virginia 88 duquesne 84 drew schifino scored 27 of his 29 points after halftime and host west virginia 4 2 beat duquesne 2 3 in overtime ap nc state 78 hartford 49 marcus melvin scored 20 points for host north carolina state 5 1 against hartford 2 3 which got 14 points from jerell parker ap virginia tech 73 radford 60 bryant matthews and zabian dowdell scored 18 points each for host virginia tech 5 3 against radford 4 4 ap georgetown 91 elon 70 gerald riley scored 28 points and brandon bowman added 19 for host georgetown 7 0 which forced 32 turnovers against elon 3 4 ap
