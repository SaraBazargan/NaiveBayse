it took roger maris 34 years to break babe ruth 's record for most home runs in a season and 37 years for mark mcgwire to break maris 's mark with his 70 home runs in 1998 now just three seasons later this most venerated of baseball records is again under siege this time by barry bonds of the san francisco giants as baseball reaches its all star game break bonds the giants 36 year old left fielder has hit 39 home runs more than any player including mcgwire has ever produced by this point in the season even though he has not done so since june 23 bonds has hit home runs at a torrid pace this season 1 for every 65 at bats compared with mcgwire 's record setting rate of every 727 at bats in 1998 in 1998 when both sammy sosa and mcgwire broke the old record fans wondered whether the game had become just a little easier from a batter 's perspective but bonds 's run on the record is taking place in a year otherwise known for improved pitching runs and home runs per game are down slightly compared with last season and the number of teams scoring in the double digits has fallen significantly fans may argue over whether this is due to tougher pitching or a reconfigured strike zone enlarged vertically and shrunken horizontally like his father bobby a gifted player who hit 30 or more home runs and stole 30 or more bases in five different seasons in his 14 year career bonds is a remarkably versatile ballplayer he is an outstanding outfielder a speedy base runner and a consistent hitter averaging better than 300 over seven seasons in 1990 one of three seasons in which he was selected as the national league 's most valuable player bonds set the modern gold standard for versatility by hitting 301 driving in 114 runs scoring 104 runs slamming 33 homers and stealing 52 bases so far bonds has comfortably weathered the pressure of the home run chase but if he is to threaten mcgwire 's record he must find a way out of his slump baseball could be headed for a golden autumn with cal ripken of the baltimore orioles making his last appearances at american league ballparks before he retires and bonds challenging the home run mark
