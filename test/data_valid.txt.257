to the editor re lending a hand in an african village do n't mind the goats by adam cohen editorial observer aug 1 my husband and i recently spent two weeks in burkina faso with our son he is in the peace corps and in the town where he teaches we were treated as honored guests and witnessed the unfailing hospitality and kindness of the burkinabe people while volunteers may at times feel that their efforts are insignificant or have little effect i agree with mr cohen that nothing could be more important i was impressed by the other peace corps volunteers we met and by their dedication and strong commitment to the african people volunteers from all agencies and groups can make a difference i urge them to go knowing that they will not be forgotten becky mcglothlin fayetteville nc aug 5 2003
