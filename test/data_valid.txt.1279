the two sides traded accusations of misconduct and manipulation today in the overnight counting of absentee ballots cast by floridians abroad a tally marred by confusion over rules and vastly differing standards from one county to the next gov george w bush 's campaign accused democrats of conspiring to knock out as many ballots as possible from members of the military who were expected to have voted mostly for mr bush the campaign issued a statement from retired gen h norman schwarzkopf who had campaigned for mr bush calling it a very sad day in our country when service members find that because of some technicality out of their control they are denied the right to vote for the president of the united states who will be their commander in chief democrats countered that republicans set out to keep military ballots in the count even when they should have been thrown out i think that they wanted to get every military vote they could counted regardless of the law said bob poe chairman of the florida democratic party they use the law when it suits their purposes and ignore the law when it suits their purposes there 's an amazing tremendous inconsistency on their part democratic officials said that they were insisting on abiding by the rule that all ballots bear postmarks and that the ballots most likely to lack postmarks were military ballots but they denied that they were trying to systematically disenfranchise military voters in both cases the accusations seemed a bit exaggerated but they illustrated both the uncertainty over which ballots were legal and the heightened tension involved in a count in which each vote could influence the result in florida and determine who wins its 25 decisive electoral votes i guess i would n't be surprised if there was another round of challenges in court because of this said jenny backus spokeswoman for the florida democratic party though the overseas absentee votes widened mr bush 's overall lead today to 930 votes democrats say they believe that the lead will be erased by hand recounts of all ballots cast in some counties statewide canvassers accepted 2206 ballots and rejected 1420 or 39 percent of the total according to an unofficial tally by the associated press which had reporters in each of the 67 counties in county after county officials said that never before had anyone questioned the way they counted a handful of overseas ballots more than a week after the election because never before had those votes mattered to the outcome normally we 're the maytag repairman around this time said fred galey supervisor of elections in brevard county no one needs us or pays much attention to us but on friday county officials across the state gathered to count overseas ballots received after election day with the eyes of the nation and indeed much of the world on them and the presidency potentially in the balance both parties had observers in each county inspecting ballots and raising objections to some while defending the validity of others those officials across the state complained of unclear instructions from katherine harris the florida secretary of state and her office contributing to differing interpretations of the law in particular there was widespread disagreement over the rules on postmarks which was also the subject of the partisan charges and countercharges in heavily republican counties county canvassing boards reviewing the ballots on friday often decided to include military ballots that had no postmarks in mostly democratic counties canvassing boards tended to throw out those ballots ballots could usually be identified as military or civilian by their envelopes without being opened that discrepancy contributed to but did not fully explain a stark difference in the count in counties carried by mr bush 29 percent of the overseas ballots were ruled invalid but in counties carried by mr gore the figure was 60 percent in duval county carried by mr bush the canvassing board rejected 64 of 542 or 12 percent the second largest number of ballots was in broward county a gore stronghold where the canvassing board threw out 304 of 396 or 77 percent in escambia county two of the three canvassing board members at first said they were inclined to invalidate 50 military ballots without postmarks but were swayed by arguments from republican lawyers present and ultimately the board voted to include them john gannon a lawyer observing the counting there for the democratic party protested complaining that without postmarks we 're going down the slippery slope of how the votes got into the supervisor 's office in the first place in orange county the canvassing board rejected about 60 military ballots with missing postmarks or postmarks dated after the election over the objections of republicans in polk county a republican lawyer john stargel said the party had directed people like him who were observing the counting to simply do whatever they could to make sure military ballots were included florida law states that an overseas ballot must have a postmark either from a foreign country 's postal service or from a united states military post office but the military often fails to postmark mail a federal law says that the military must mail service members ballots from abroad expeditiously and free of postage republicans contend that without any postage there is often no postmark so the intent of the federal law is that military ballots without postmarks must be considered valid the bush campaign obtained and gave to reporters a copy of instructions the democratic party had sent to its observers and canvassing board members reinforcing the need for a postmark and drawing particular attention to the possibility that they might be missing on military ballots the democrats in turn obtained and distributed the republicans instructions to their observers reminding them of the federal law and instructing them in defending military ballots each party argued that the paperwork was evidence of malfeasance in fact each set of instructions simply offered a differing interpretation of the law adding to the confusion ms harris instructed counties that ballots postmarked after election day but signed and dated on or before that day be counted county officials said that was a reversal of past practice in which ballots postmarked after the election were thrown out and some complained that when they sought clarification ms harris 's office gave them contradictory instructions ms harris 's office has so far refused to comment on the complaints
