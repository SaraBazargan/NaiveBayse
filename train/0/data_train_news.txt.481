 representative dick armey the house majority leader called today for a rapid reduction in income tax rates to help head off a recession giving a lift to president elect george w bush 's proposal for a broad package of tax cuts in a memorandum to republicans in the house mr armey said the party 's priorities should be a reduction in all income tax rates the centerpiece of mr bush 's plan and expanding individual retirement accounts and 401 k retirement savings plans a measure that overwhelmingly passed the house last year only to die in the senate the cuts he said should be enacted promptly and should be retroactive to the start of this year mr bush 's aides are considering accelerating their 16 trillion tax cut plan which as first formulated would not take effect until 2002 though they have made a big tax cut a primary goal republican leaders in congress have been lukewarm until now in their support for an across the board reduction in income tax rates in part because most benefits would go to the wealthiest taxpayers many republicans have indicated a preference for measures like repealing the federal estate tax and giving a tax cut to married couples but the bad economic news in recent weeks has provided mr bush with an argument in favor of rate cuts one that mr armey expanded on today it is vitally important that congress move quickly to enact a pro growth tax cut that could help avert a recession he wrote some are arguing that we should put off the income tax rate cut until later in the year i disagree the income tax rate cut must move first whether alone or as part of a larger tax cut package democrats have blocked most republican tax cutting efforts over the past few years senator tom daschle of south dakota the party 's leader in the senate and representative charles b rangel of manhattan the ranking democrat on the house ways and means committee signaled today that they remained opposed to the approach advocated by mr armey but with the economy slowing and the federal budget surplus continuing to grow opposition to tax cuts among democrats is softening and democratic leaders are considering offering their own tax relief packages possibly built around a reduction in the bottom income tax rate of 15 percent there is a growing sentiment that a tax cut may very well be necessary said michael siegel a spokesman for senator max baucus of montana the senior democrat on the finance committee but he added democrats would insist that any tax cuts be reasonable equitable and not interfere with our ability to pay down the debt shore up social security and medicare and provide a prescription drug benefit to seniors in one indication of changing attitudes among democrats toward tax cuts felix g rohatyn the financier and former ambassador to france said last week he believed a substantial tax reduction now would be good economic policy it would not be a bad thing to have a reasonable tax reduction now he said not so much because it will stimulate the economy overnight but because taxes are relatively high and we can afford a tax cut of one kind or another
