 the craziness just goes on and on season after season the mets are in hot pursuit of tom glavine nothing new there the mets have been chasing glavine and the atlanta braves for a decade in what has been major league baseball 's version of a road runner cartoon no matter what the mets do or do n't do the shifty speedy braves have an answer an antidote or a formula that leaves the mets grasping at air or falling flat on their faces this time the mets are going after glavine one of the pillars of atlanta 's pitching dynasty they might get him and therein lies the problem should they rush in and make glavine the trophy of their off season safari i 'd advise caution for 10 years the mets have been outmaneuvered by john schuerholz the braves general manager and this may be another of his cagey moves glavine was 18 11 last season but pitched poorly in the playoffs his postseason performance an 0 2 record and 13 runs allowed in seven and two thirds innings might not have been an aberration it might have been the beginning of a decline that typically for the mets would accelerate if he joined them this season has to be either the end for steve phillips the mets general manager or the beginning of his and the team 's turnaround for the mets to reach another level phillips has to move beyond ok with the mets payroll ok is not good enough despite lots of talent the mets finished last in the national league east last season the team 's signature was weak hitting inconsistent pitching atrocious fielding and questionable effort art howe was a good choice to replace bobby valentine as manager in seven seasons howe made a young hungry team with lots to prove into a dynamo his oakland teams reached the playoffs the past three years the mets that howe inherited are neither young nor hungry they are well paid and pudgy where does glavine fit in he is 36 he has spent his entire 16 year career with atlanta he is 242 143 can he reach 300 victories with this mets team which is like a ghost ship full of players who seem to be shells of themselves maybe glavine is just a shell of himself maybe that 's why atlanta is contemplating letting him walk after all these years this is what phillips and fred wilpon have to figure out in this game of chess is glavine an unprotected overlooked piece or is he part of a grand trap forget how the mets have been outplayed by atlanta on the field the mets have been clobbered by atlanta in the front office as well schuerholz has outmaneuvered the mets at every turn he snatches up the right free agent calls up the right player at the right time signs veterans at the right time since 1993 with glavine greg maddux and john smoltz the braves have had one of the best pitching staffs in baseball last season atlanta added gary sheffield the mets added mo vaughn atlanta added crucial role players the mets added stars on the decline now atlanta is watching the mets scramble after glavine the mets have proposed a three year deal at 285 million yesterday team glavine countered with a four year 45 million contract if i were the mets i 'd look at atlanta and do what it does schuerholz who knows glavine better than anyone else is offering a two year deal with a team option for 2005 in fact atlanta seems to hold the hammer schuerholz recently pulled off a deal with florida and colorado to acquire mike hampton the tough 30 year old pitcher who had two frustrating seasons in colorado somehow you just know that hampton is going to be revitalized in atlanta we believe he will benefit from our environment schuerholz said phillips can not say the same thing about glavine in fact the mets want glavine to provide a new atmosphere wilpon has cast glavine as the new face of the mets but the team needs an overhaul not a new face the mets pursuit of glavine is understandable but wrongheaded wilpon in his first off season as the sole owner of the mets is valiantly trying to repair the damage from last season in a steinbrennian maneuver he has rolled out the carpet for glavine a player he fancies as part savior part spark plug and part stabilizer for the mets but wilpon is barking up the wrong tree what he needs to be asking is when will schuerholz become a free agent
