 james bond went to bed thursday night feeling on top of the world harlan 's holiday was established as the kentucky derby favorite but bond the 44 year old trainer knew that his horse buddha was ready to shock the world buddha won the wood memorial three weeks ago and was shifting into higher gears with each successive day bond 's dreams were shattered the first thing yesterday morning he was taking buddha for a routine 5 am walk when he noticed the horse was favoring his left leg bond brought the colt back to the barn and called in a couple of veterinarians no one could find anything wrong with buddha 's left foot but the horse was uncomfortable and was favoring the foot a farrier was brought in to find out if something was wrong with the horseshoe there was no apparent problem with the shoe or the horse 's foot but buddha could n't run and at 6 40 am friday bond did the unthinkable he told churchill downs that buddha would not run in the kentucky derby ben glass the racing manager for buddha 's owners gary and mary west said that on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the worst the injury rated a 1 but a 1 was enough to scratch the horse from the race he said when bond addressed reporters he was devastated after 26 years as a trainer he had finally made his first kentucky derby he chose his words carefully but his appearance told the story his voice cracked his lip quivered he was close to tears it is gut wrenching he said that was one of my worst moments i just really really believed in my heart that we had a really super horse to show the world the horse is just getting better he had trained so perfect everything was going our way and we had a bump in the road it was the wrong bump at the wrong time by midday buddha 's injury was a mystery but the foot was ruled out as the source the further we went up he got sorer and sorer bond said the only thing we have left is basically a shoulder hopefully it 's soft tissue hopefully it 's a pulled muscle racing is a roller coaster game eight hours after the buddha trauma bond was in the winner 's circle accepting congratulations after one of his other horses legislator won the american turf trophy on oaks day the lord works in mysterious ways bond said he knew i was pretty upset today and he gave me this one and tried to soften the blow h james bond is one of the most respected trainers in racing he has earnings of 25092496 in a career that began in 1976 yet this would have been his first derby appearance and he believed he had a derby winner after his horse won the wood i thought the horse got a lot of respect and he deserved it bond said he came here he trained really well the first two days last night he was great this morning i woke up in a great mood i walked to the barn and basically the rug was pulled out from under me today yet here was bond yesterday afternoon watching another horse win by a head the adjustment he made between the morning and the afternoon encapsulates this crazy game there 's been some bad days in this game but the highs are highs and the lows are lows bond said but there 's not a better game in the world and the horses are wonderful i ca n't wait to get up in the morning to see them this is a blow for everybody it 's a blow to the fans poor pat day pat was very excited day was supposed to ride buddha but because of yet another twist of fate an injury to corey nakatani he will ride blue burner a colt owned by george steinbrenner this was not bond 's first major racing disappointment in 1999 he trained behrens the favorite to win the classic in the breeders cup the horse finished seventh and bond was criticized for his training methods still losing when you compete is one thing never getting to the post is something else when you get beat you 're puzzled you 're upset bond said but this here you did n't get a chance to play when you 're on the sidelines and you ca n't play that 's a whole different story if you get a chance to play you can beat yourself up for whatever but today i 'll never know the outcome the other way i knew i got beat bond will second guess himself over the buddha injury but second guessing in this business is futile the only recourse is to pick another horse by the end of the day bond had come to terms with the task at hand i 'm going to go back to the drawing board he said i 'm going to work harder and try to get horse of the year at least i 'll know in my heart i brought the right horse to churchill
