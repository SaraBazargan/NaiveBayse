 dikembe mutombo watched with despair from the bench when the nets sank in houston and cheered when they resurfaced in new orleans it 's like we 're in the ocean and we got hit by a huge wave mutombo said we 're going to bounce back off the wave i want us to bounce back that way there 's not so much pressure when i come back mutombo has almost recovered from surgery to repair the torn ligament in his right wrist last december and hopes to return to his starting post at center before the end of the month after three debilitating losses in texas the nets won for the first time in eight games on the road sunday against the hornets 102 92 with 18 games remaining before the playoffs 15 against eastern conference teams the nets 39 25 are two games ahead of philadelphia for the atlantic division lead and a game behind detroit for the eastern conference lead they need to win 13 games to tie last season 's record but the nets are determined not to dwell on last season or even the frustrations of last week instead they are looking ahead that is where mutombo comes in i 'll definitely be back before houston mutombo said referring to the game against 7 foot 6 yao ming and the houston rockets at home on march 31 mutombo will participate in shooting drills this week and may practice next week i 'm very close he said the nets are not sure what to expect from the 36 year old mutombo while happy to have his 7 foot 2 defensive presence back they know they can not suddenly rely on him i think that 's real unfair to look at deke and say he 's our savior coach byron scott said we want to be playing real solid basketball when he gets back and get him into that puzzle not look at him once he gets back and everybody takes a big sigh of relief he 'll anchor the center position he 'll block shots and rebound and intimidate guys mutombo said he would do more than that even though he had not fully adjusted to the offense at the time of his injury when i come back i am going to have an impact mutombo said i 'm going to be much better than i was at the start of the season i 'm more fit and skill wise i have improved a few things i have improved my shooting with my left hand mutombo joined the nets in san antonio on the second game of the four game road trip shooting soft jumpers and free throws while continuing his therapy he tore the ligament on thanksgiving in los angeles and when he had his cast removed after six weeks he could only work on his conditioning on an exercise bicycle so he read lance armstrong 's autobiography it 's not about the bike and drew inspiration from armstrong 's recovery from cancer you ca n't let one thing stop you mutombo said illness and injuries happen it was a big shock the way things happened to me you want to stay positive every day at times that was difficult for him the nets were on a hot streak in december and january but they have struggled since the all star game break winning 5 of 15 games the nets are curious to see whether their victory against new orleans will begin a reversal of their shooting woes or whether it was merely a stopgap we 'll see kenyon martin said it 's just one game it feels great just to see guys playing well guys making shots we have to keep playing hard after the nets beat indiana on feb 20 they lost their next three games after beating the knicks they lost to utah at home at dallas at san antonio and at houston on sunday night jason kidd revealed that he had tendinitis in his left achilles an injury that affected his lateral movement and his spring that may explain his 12 for 46 shooting in the three games in texas a magnetic resonance imaging exam yesterday was negative despite the pain kidd had 17 points 10 assists and 9 rebounds in 43 minutes on sunday against new orleans jason is just different mutombo said you do n't compare him with anyone in this league the things he does on a daily basis are incredible he plays through fatigue and injury and makes sure the team gets better against the hornets kidd had help brian scalabrine a second year forward showed sparked off the bench with 16 points shooting 7 for 9 in 27 minutes scott used scalabrine more than rodney rogers who has struggled all season but everyone else on the nets seemed to have snapped out of their slumps in new orleans they played with urgency again recognizing they can not wait for anyone
