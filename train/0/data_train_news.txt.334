 giants players said that coach jim fassel informed them today in a morning meeting that he would be calling the team 's offensive plays a switch that would take the responsibility out of the hands of sean payton the offensive coordinator the giants have scored seven offensive touchdowns in seven games 50 points in their last 53 possessions fassel has only a few options for substantive change and with his team dangling on the edge of oblivion he will be the one who determines the plays kerry collins will call in the huddle sunday night against the jacksonville jaguars we do n't blame coach payton for fumbling the ball or jumping offsides for holding calls tight end dan campbell said coach payton is not out there doing those things we are unfortunately he ended up taking the fall for it not him as in we 're putting the blame on him a change had to be made and it was made and now it 's up to us fassel would not acknowledge in a news conference that he would call the plays on sunday for the sake of competitive advantage and he and payton answered questions about the forthcoming change as if it were hypothetical but fassel has already informed payton of his decision which seems borne more out of circumstance than any particular dissatisfaction with the way payton has done his job i will make any changes necessary within the limits of knowing we 're not in training camp now fassel said i 'm not going to sit still and watch us average one touchdown per game i 'm not going to do it when something needs to be done when we need to shake things up i will make a change payton said he would disagree with a decision to change his role i do n't know that play calling is the reason we 're 3 4 let 's just say that but his outward demeanor did not waver as he spoke he indicated he would continue to work diligently and prepare for games in whatever role he is assigned there are certain people whose heads are on a different plane than others payton said it 's always been a head coach a coordinator a quarterback that 's part of the deal and that 's part of the responsibility to these positions i take full responsibility for what we 've done on offense from there we 'll see what happens he 's the head coach ultimately he 's in charge i 'm sure he 'll do what 's best for this team payton joined the giants before the 1999 season and that december fassel turned over the play calling role to him because of his respect for payton 's ability and because he said it would allow him more time to address other parts of the job of head coach the giants went to the super bowl the next season but this season has gone badly for the offense the giants have moved the ball easily in the middle of the field with collins throwing to amani toomer jeremy shockey and ike hilliard but the team 's running game in short yardage situations has been atrocious sabotaging the offense inside the opponents 20 yard line the giants have scored touchdowns in only 5 of 19 opportunities inside the red zone a crucial moment for the struggling offense came against arizona on sept 29 with the giants deep in their own territory and only 14 seconds remaining in the first half fassel decided to try for another score payton called a play and collins threw an interception that justin lucas ran back for a touchdown the giants are 1 3 since then generating few points and too many turnovers and penalties if this is something that happens coach fassel is smart enough to understand things that we do well and things that we do n't do well and things that we want done payton said he understands kerry 's strengths and weaknesses he 's called plays a long time payton is in the midst of a difficult period his mother jeanne payton died less than two weeks ago and now he is essentially facing a demotion this profession will always be a bottom line business payton said and i 'm big enough to understand that i understood that when i took this position if things should change sean payton will do just fine trust me extra points ron dixon will step into the starting role in place of ike hilliard who is out for the rest of the season after dislocating his right shoulder but the rookie tim carter will probably begin practicing some of the routes hilliard and dixon have run he could challenge dixon for that spot in a couple of weeks guard jason whittle received an injection in his injured lower back and it greatly decreased his discomfort if whittle can play against jacksonville giants coach jim fassel said he would step back into his old starting job and dusty zeigler would be bumped out of the lineup
