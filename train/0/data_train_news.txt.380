 yankees manager joe torre yesterday sent his beleaguered and aching veteran david cone to the bullpen for the second time this season likely ensuring that the pitcher would stay there for the rest of his devastating 2000 season and for the second time torre took cone 's old friend and former mets teammate dwight gooden out of the bullpen and put him into the rotation gooden will start in cone 's place tomorrow torre said that cone 's left shoulder which he dislocated sept 5 while diving for a bunt was still not 100 percent and that prompted the move cone has a career low 4 13 record and 655 earned run average this season you know with coney it 's more guts than anything else torre said we 're talking about enduring the pain and at this time maybe being in the bullpen is not asking him to do too much we 'll just reverse things a bit at this juncture we 're just doing it a start at a time torre said the only way cone would make a post season roster would be in the bullpen but even that is not a sure thing right now perhaps by making a few relief appearances torre said cone could help himself cone arrived at yankee stadium at 9 45 am yesterday hoping to talk to torre but he did not speak with his manager until about 11 am he accepted the news with professionalism torre said but cone sighed in disappointment when he discussed the demotion at his locker i knew all along that the chances were remote that i would get a playoff start cone said i could read the writing on the wall any chance i would have would be in the bullpen at the end of the staff that 's just the way it is and i have to get ready for that i have to prove i can still get hitters out it 's been a hellacious year for me but it ai n't over yet if i can help the team in just one game i 've got to be ready to do that in his last outing wednesday at toronto cone was shelled for six hits and seven runs in three and two thirds innings it was his second start since returning from his shoulder injury following a shaky outing against cleveland gooden relieved cone in toronto and was impressive allowing one earned run while striking out five in four and a third shutout innings cone 37 said that while his shoulder still causes him pain and inhibits his range of motion i can pitch through these things then he added i 'm not 20 anymore the future is now for me meanwhile gooden keeps reinventing himself he has virtually locked up a postseason spot on the roster even he sounded surprised there 's no way i could imagine any of this said gooden who at 35 was released by two teams this season before coming to the yankees in july the yankees principal owner george steinbrenner pushed for gooden to return to new york and the yankees started him in place of cone who went to the bullpen for the first time in the first of the cross town day night doubleheader against the mets in july gooden thought it would be a one shot deal i left my clothes in tampa he said with a laugh and then added i 've been more appreciative now than even in my rookie year when torre told him about tomorrow 's start gooden immediately went to cone me personally i wish cone would be the guy gooden said our friendship is a lot deeper than teammates but gooden has been more reliable this season whether coming out of the bullpen for 11 relief appearances or starting four games with the yankees he has a 281 earned average and is 4 1 at this stage in his career gooden is thrilled with his role of utility pitcher with the yankees i do n't know if i want to start again for another team gooden said i 've come to the conclusion where i want to end my career in new york whether it be this year or next cone said he will reevaluate his future after this season preferably after he pitches in whatever role in the postseason i have been throwing the ball reasonably well he said obviously joe will factor in my track record and hopefully that is going to help me get on the roster
