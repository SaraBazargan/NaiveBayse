 oleg kvasha the islanders talented yet confounding left wing has had flashes of brilliance before then the flashes end his inner fire seems more like a flickering hearth than a blast furnace kvasha is playing well again for the islanders 20 18 5 2 who wrap up a four game trip sunday at atlanta he has scored four goals in his last six games including an overtime goal thursday in a 3 2 victory over st louis as a result he is playing more it 's nice islanders center aleksei yashin said of kvasha 's play keep your fingers crossed he 's moving well and hopefully he can build some confidence with the way he 's been playing the islanders wary of kvasha 's inconsistencies have learned to temper their praise of him kvasha had one goal and two assists in his first 26 games michael peca the islanders captain said that the team 's coaches had been hard on kvasha and that they had been patient as recently as jan 11 kvasha a 6 foot 5 230 pound russian was on the fourth line which has minimal playing time late in games but kvasha had an assist and scored a late goal with the fourth line against atlanta on saturday and this may have gained him some attention on monday coach peter laviolette put kvasha on the team 's top line yashin 's where kvasha had been expected to spend most of this season kvasha scored again on monday against washington and laviolette said the line was the most productive in an ugly 5 0 loss wednesday to the devils trent hunter the right wing on the line was sent back to bridgeport after the game and laviolette promoted arron asham a rapidly developing 24 year old wing who can skate shoot hard and land a punch the reconfigured line was effective against the blues yashin scored his first goal in seven games asham seemed to track down every loose puck and kvasha knocked the game winning goal past blues goaltender brent johnson 1 minute 59 seconds into overtime he looks like he 's having fun out there laviolette said that may be because kvasha has vowed to keep his game simple on the game winning goal he simply charged to the net and shoved a backhand shot past johnson kvasha figured the closer he got to the net the better his scoring chances laviolette said that 's his strength that 's the vision we have of olie to drive to the net like that hard driven has not been used to describe kvasha whom the islanders acquired with mark parrish on june 24 2000 in the much criticized trade that sent the prized goaltender roberto luongo and center olli jokinen to florida he scored 24 goals in his first two seasons with the islanders but they have come in clusters he ended last season with seven goals in 12 games but he had six goals in the 59 games before that and three were in a five game span kvasha was a healthy scratch in four games last season and three games this season he has been sidelined with knee shoulder and ankle injuries most important he failed to keep a spot on yashin 's line when it was all but handed to him in training camp maybe in the beginning i tried to do too much i tried this and i tried that kvasha said now i am doing one thing at a time islanders fans at nassau coliseum have booed him but when he does well they sing his name to the melody of a soccer chant substituting oleg for ole he loves to hear them cheer and he promises more it probably does not help that when he skates his strides are long nearly effortless which makes it look as if he is not trying he often overskates the puck or loses it without being checked he is also charmingly self deprecating he was asked to re create his goal scoring play thursday and he said with a shrug i 'm not sure i do n't remember what happened there but kvasha knows he needs the work he was one of only six skaters who came to an islanders workout tuesday in syosset ny he knows his roll started with a goal against pittsburgh that he considered one of his luckiest when you have n't scored in a couple of months you just need something to get you going kvasha said there were a lot of things in my mind when i did n't play great i was thinking 'should i do this or should i do that there was something always in my mind now he is just playing but the emphasis as always is on the word now ultimately it 's up to him to play up to his capabilities to play to his potential laviolette said whether i 'm right or wrong i give ice time based on what i see it 's almost like you have to give me a reason to put you out there
