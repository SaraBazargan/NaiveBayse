 the west nile virus has now taken over the no 1 spot in the unofficial list of infectious threats from far off places the hong kong flu held the position three years ago and the ebola virus three years before that as before the driving force is fear and observers are enmeshed in controversy over what action to take millions of chickens were destroyed to curb transmission of hong kong flu to humans the west nile target is the mosquito with widespread insecticide spraying under way how dangerous is the virus we have data from 1999 indicating that it will kill 5 or 10 people along the mid atlantic seaboard if it is not controlled this corresponds with deaths from similar viruses transmitted from birds or mammals to people by mosquitoes but essentially nontransmissible from person to person assuming that control efforts are effective at breaking the transmission from bird to human several lives will be saved and many people will not have to suffer from the infection if this is the basis for supporting the spraying and for the attention given to the problem fine some people however worry that the virus will spread out of control and the news that it has been found in massachusetts will fuel those fears but the epidemiological study of infectious diseases like west nile suggests that this fear is overblown every year countless mosquito borne diseases immigrate into the united states often into regions where they once thrived malaria comes into kennedy airport and dengue fever slips across the mexican border into brownsville tex the mosquitoes that transmit these diseases are still here often in abundance yet the diseases do not really spread probably because our window screens air conditioned cars and buildings tend to keep us on the safe side of a boundary if mosquito borne malaria and dengue fever which are so superbly adapted to causing mischief in human beings can not make a go of it in modern day america then what chance does the little old west nile virus have paul w ewald is a professor of biology at amherst college
