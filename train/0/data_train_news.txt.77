 andy pettitte has four world series rings and has won 10 postseason games but most of the attention in this world series has gone to curt schilling and randy johnson while schilling and johnson are powerful intimidating pitchers who deserve the attention pettitte was asked if he ever felt he had been forgotten that 's the way it 's been my whole career said pettitte who will start in game 2 i 've become accustomed to that i do n't go out and really i do n't see myself going out and dominating games sometimes i just get the other guys out and do n't let them score too much pettitte then praised schilling and johnson for being so dominant before adding i kind of do it in an i guess an ugly fashion pettitte was being self deprecating his pitching is not ugly but his hitting is pettitte who is 1 for 18 with eight strikeouts in his career will probably be the only left handed hitter in the lineup against the left handed johnson on sunday i hit 365 my senior year pettitte said that 's about hitting 150 or something in the big leagues everybody here hits 500 in high school i was not a good hitter did n't have much pop at all jack curry
