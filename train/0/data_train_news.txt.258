 the scene was replayed throughout spring training each time the veterans joe mcewing and jay bell would speak to reporters in the mets clubhouse the rookie ty wigginton whose locker was positioned between theirs would sit with his eyes focused on each question and his teammates answers i guess i like to learn wigginton said later mcewing noticed and as camp went on and wigginton established himself as the mets third baseman he asked more and more questions every time he did he would talk to me about it and see if he was right mcewing said he did n't want to make anybody feel uncomfortable he was seeing if he was doing all right nearly five months into his rookie season wigginton 25 has become one of the few players the mets can depend on when they traded roberto alomar to the chicago white sox on july 1 wigginton became a candidate to shift to second base next season but manager art howe and jim duquette the interim general manager both said wigginton would remain at third base where he started his 123rd game on friday wigginton has provided stability even though he received the third base job almost by default the mets thought they had an agreement with the japanese free agent norihiro nakamura last december but he changed his mind at the last minute after a winter without a third baseman they signed bell days before spring training to compete with wigginton for the starting job before the season started he was option no 3 or 4 duquette said friday by telephone it 's hard to believe with the way he 's played he was n't option no 1 duquette said wigginton 's defensive development was the biggest surprise the mets sent wigginton to the dominican republic to play winter ball in the off season there he started beside shortstop jose reyes who offered rave reviews of wigginton now duquette likes wigginton 's play on balls hit to his right that 's a change from what the mets expected the mets left wigginton exposed to other teams in the rule v draft in 1999 and every team passed on him he hit 21 home runs that season for class a st lucie and 20 the next for class aa binghamton and began building a reputation as a power hitting infielder but wigginton had only eight homers and just one in his previous 167 at bats before hitting home runs on thursday and friday on thursday he hit a 413 foot drive over the center field wall at qualcomm stadium in san diego with his parents in the stands his home run on friday came against the dodgers hideo nomo for the mets only run in a 2 1 loss entering tonight 's game wigginton 's 29 doubles led the mets and national league rookies and are a team record for a rookie he also led the mets in runs scored with 63 and was second to cliff floyd with 64 runs batted in he 's got juice howe said there 's no doubt in my mind he should become a 15 to 20 home run guy on a regular basis wigginton said i could see even more than that i could see next year hitting 20 plus he has adjusted as pitchers threw him breaking balls away then jammed him inside they now alternate between the two he continues to make adjustments at the plate duquette said eventually he 's going to drive the ball with power when duquette met with him a few weeks ago wigginton reported that the physical grind of the big leagues had not been as great as the mental one the more frequent days off and more comfortable travel compensate for the longer schedule but the mental adjustments are tougher duquette is impressed that wigginton makes the distinction with wigginton 's development and the mets plans to keep him at third they can focus on second base the last two years have led the mets to conclude that they have become too old with too much turnover at too many key positions so they hope to build a young core wigginton is a start as is reyes and possibly the first baseman catcher jason phillips the mets plan to strengthen themselves up the middle focusing on second base and center field but next year 's budget will most likely allow for filling only one position through free agency the other will come from within with jeff duncan a candidate at center and the minor leaguers danny garcia and victor diaz at second
