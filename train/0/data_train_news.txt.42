 the yankees played as if they had a flight to catch tonight and they only wish that were true after sprinting through a 5 3 loss to the baltimore orioles in 2 hours 12 minutes the yankees wondered openly about the wisdom of playing on thursday with hurricane isabel bearing down on this city i 'm sorry we have to play period said david wells who pitched a complete game in the loss it 's not good the city 's closing down the government 's closing down and we 're playing figure that out yankees players were informed this morning that thursday 's game had been moved up to 12 35 pm from 7 05 pm it was little consolation the yankees wanted the orioles to postpone the game and reschedule it for next weekend in new york the orioles who are home through the weekend said today that they believed there was at least a chance the storm would pass a compromise proposal that had been discussed earlier in the week a day night doubleheader today was rejected by the players union said mike mussina the yankees representative so the yankees are left to hope they can play on thursday and fly to florida for a weekend series with the tampa bay devil rays they plan to take a bus to philadelphia after thursday 's game and meet their charter there i do n't really see it first baseman jason giambi said i do n't see the need to get it in especially when they 're shutting down schools and having the navy get their ships out i hope everything works out and everybody 's safe i do n't understand the thinking of what they 're trying to accomplish joe torre the yankees manager had a theory everybody 's scratching their head about why we 're cutting it so close but it 's not our decision torre said later adding when you 're dealing with revenue in today 's game that 's what it comes down to it was windy at times tonight but it did not rain mussina who is scheduled to start thursday in pursuit of his 200th career victory has reasonable expectations for the weather asked if he hopes the wind blows in mussina said i just want to be able to stand out there wells also has 199 career victories but he squandered his chance for no 200 early in the game tonight he retired 18 of his last 19 hitters and the one base runner in that stretch was caught stealing meaning wells faced the minimum from the third out of the second inning through the orioles last batter but he allowed 5 of the first 10 batters to score two on home runs larry bigbie drove a 2 0 pitch over the fence in left for a homer in the first and jay gibbons crushed a high slider over the right field wall on wells 's first pitch in the second four of the next six orioles had hits leading to three more runs wells quickly settled in aiming the ball around the knees keeping it low and satisfying torre i congratulated him on coming back torre said he was down 5 0 and he did n't quit i respect that the yankees had nine hits in six and two thirds innings against baltimore 's eric dubose but scored only in the fourth and seventh juan rivera pulled a two run homer off the foul pole to close the gap to two and chase dubose but that was as close as they got wells who has two more starts left in the regular season said he was not disappointed about failing to become the 99th pitcher with 200 victories it does n't matter wells said i want to win that 's all it does n't matter if i win or somebody else wins mussina has been more introspective talking about the milestone today he listed several prominent pitchers who never reached it including sandy koufax dizzy dean ron guidry and the yankees pitching coach mel stottlemyre stottlemyre was in his 11th season with the yankees and had 164 victories when he started on june 11 1974 in the fourth inning he threw a curveball to the angels frank robinson and felt a pop in his right shoulder it was a torn rotator cuff and stottlemyre pitched two more innings the rest of his career he was done at age 32 as a pitching coach stottlemyre saw david cone and dwight gooden begin sparkling careers that ended shy of 200 to stottlemyre the number carries a special meaning three hundred is way up there at the top but there 's not too many that have won 200 either stottlemyre said that 's a heck of a plateau we have one guy at 300 and two guys going for 200 and all three are still regular starters in a very good rotation still contributing and still very forceful when they go out there mussina who turns 35 in december said he did not know if he would pitch long enough to get to 300 as roger clemens did in june i 'm certainly not getting any younger the strike zone is getting smaller and smaller and the hitters are getting bigger and stronger mussina said am i still going to be as effective three years or seven years from now i do n't know whatever happens mussina said he will have accomplished something important after his next victory to be able to walk away from the game and say you won 200 you know it 's not 300 but it 's certainly something mussina said
