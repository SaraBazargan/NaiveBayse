 no matter what happens with the mets free agent pitchers this off season steve phillips has pledged not to shortchange the mets or their fans next season i think everybody can be assured phillips said that we 'll have 11 pitchers to start next season with i do n't know their names but i 'm sure we 'll find someone who wants to come play for us mike hampton rick reed and bobby jones three fifths of the starting rotation are free agents john franco and turk wendell two important elements of the team 's relief corps also became free agents after the world series franco after a philadelphia flirtation has decided to remain with the mets and some other members of that group have indicated that they too would like to stay but the mets have n't secured their continued loyalty with new contracts anywhere from one to all four of the remaining free agents are expected to go elsewhere only one team that has played in the world series has lost four pitchers as free agents in the ensuing off season after they won the world series in 1992 four pitchers left the toronto blue jays but remarkably they did n't miss a beat they won the world series the next season too three of the departed pitchers had been starters though not all for the entire season jimmy key was a regular who started 33 games but dave stieb was injured much of the season and made only 14 starts and david cone started seven times after the blue jays acquired him from the mets with five weeks left in the season the fourth free agent was tom henke the team 's closer the difference between the losses the blue jays sustained and those the mets face is that the blue jays had replacements ready and the mets do n't it amazes me when i look at our team photo of the '92 club said gord ash the toronto general manager the pitching staff was amazing we had solid starters who were pitching out of the bullpen there was a lot of depth as ash recalled it the blue jays lost key because he wanted a four year contract and the club had a policy at the time that permitted no more than three years for a pitcher the yankees gave key four years ash said the blue jays tried to sign cone and were prepared to give him close to the 18 million kansas city offered but the royals gave cone half the sum as a signing bonus stieb was allowed to leave because the blue jays felt he was n't healthy henke was a tough decision ash said but we felt duane ward was ready to take over that role pat hentgen a rookie who started two games in 1992 became a regular starter the following season dave stewart a free agent joined him in the rotation the pitching staff had another addition al leiter who had been hurt the previous season if the mets lose any of their pitchers they will have to replace them by signing other free agents or making trades they do n't have any hentgens or leiters or wards waiting in the wings you have to have plans a b and c phillips said and sometimes you run parallel negotiations and the market tells you who you keep more than two dozen free agent pitchers have left teams in the months after they played in the world series the first and perhaps most celebrated was jim catfish hunter he signed with the yankees two and a half months after he won game 3 of the 1974 world series en route to oakland 's third successive world series championship hunter 's defection the result of a breached contract occurred two years before the beginning of free agency as it is known today don gullett and doyle alexander the starting pitchers in game 1 of the 1976 world series were the first pitchers to leave their teams under that new procedure alexander left the yankees for the texas rangers gullett switched teams moving from the cincinnati reds to the yankees and started game 1 of the 1977 world series mike torrez started games 3 and 6 of that world series and won both games for the yankees a month later he signed with the boston red sox and was in position the following october to throw the memorable pitch that bucky dent hit for a home run in the red sox playoff game against the yankees after the yankees advanced to the world series against los angeles tommy john beat them in the first game six weeks later he signed with the yankees as a free agent john proceeded to give the yankees a performance that has gone unmatched by any free agent pitcher winning 21 and 22 victories in his first two seasons with them ed whitson did not experience similar success after he left san diego for the yankees following the 1984 world series whitson in fact did n't last two seasons with the yankees he was traded back to the padres in the 1986 season fleeing new york after having been completely intimidated by circumstances and fans jack morris left minnesota for toronto in 1991 and his 21 victories helped the blue jays get to the 1992 world series the four members of the toronto pitching staff who left after that series were n't the only pitchers to change teams a pair of atlanta pitchers left as free agents too jeff reardon and mike bielecki going elsewhere in an attempt to continue their fading careers the yankees let two pitchers from their 1996 world series staff leave john wetteland went to texas and jimmy key leaving a world series team a second time moved to baltimore kevin brown was the last pitcher to leave his world series team forsaking san diego for los angeles in 1998 the economic outlook appearing before a senate judiciary subcommittee last week commissioner bud selig said that 18 to 20 teams will lose money this year skeptics on the players side and in the academic sports economics field seldom believe such reports of wholesale losses but if the figures are correct the baseball economy may be improving in the report earlier this year of the commissioner 's blue ribbon panel on baseball economics a chart shows that 27 teams lost money in the previous five years based on selig 's washington report seven to nine of those teams will break even or make money this year
