 less than a minute before halftime last night patrick ewing stole a chicago bulls pass and casually flipped a no look pass toward a teammate as if he were magic johnson but the ball landed in the hands of elton brand thwarting a fast break opportunity and making coach jeff van gundy wince eight seconds later allan houston made another steal and basically did the same thing blindly tossing a pass intended for latrell sprewell over halfcourt and into the hands of matt maloney van gundy arms folded and face taut as he stood on the sideline was clearly bothered by the consecutive displays of carelessness if a more capable opponent had been at madison square garden such absent mindedness might have cost the knicks but the bulls 13 54 are exceptionally bad so the home team prevailed despite its slack handling of the basketball the knicks aggressive defense and chicago 's offensive ineptness meshed for a drab 78 67 victory that enabled the knicks to win after two straight defeats to the league 's conference leaders the los angeles lakers and the indiana pacers we played awful offensively but we played extremely hard defensively said van gundy whose team held chicago to just 26 second half points and 36 percent shooting over all we just could n't pass or catch tonight the ball was all over the place perhaps a subpar performance should have been expected given the knicks custom of struggling on the second night of back to back games the victory which began less than 24 hours after their tough 4 point loss at indiana improved their record in such contests to 4 11 highlight material or not though the victory meant plenty it improved the knicks record to 41 26 and left them two games ahead of toronto and philadelphia both 39 28 in the fight for third place in the eastern conference playoff race the knicks who play host to the atlanta hawks tomorrow need to create as much space as possible between them and their chasers before embarking on a brutal five game trek through the western conference that begins sunday in portland and includes contests against sacramento seattle vancouver and the los angeles lakers while the hawks are far from a juggernaut they have been too much for the knicks to handle defeating them in each of this season 's two previous meetings despite the knicks effectiveness on defense chris childs who finished with 2 points and 4 assists in 25 minutes said an effort like last night 's will not be enough in most ballgames we have to get back to enjoying each other and enjoying the game of basketball childs said we 're out there like mummies not acknowledging each other it 's the time of the season where it 's either now or never besides holding the bulls to an opponent low point total for the season the most pleasing aspect of the game for the knicks had to be the sight of marcus camby sprinting and leaping without hindrance camby who returned five games ago from a strained anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee banged the knee hard in the late moments against indiana and was limping afterward but last night on his 26th birthday there were no major signs of a problem he was not dominant but he was not bad recording 10 points and 9 rebounds in an active effort the knee is holding up said camby who flinched in pain once while on the court it is pretty fine we 'll rest it up tomorrow and get ready for friday the comfort level is not there and the stability is not there for me to stop on a dime but i felt fine tonight sprewell was perhaps the only knick playing near the top of his game he got the knicks started right with 8 first quarter points and put them ahead by 43 33 late in the second quarter by dropping consecutive midrange jumpers he made 7 of his first 8 shots and took 15 of his team high 21 points into the locker room at intermission where the knicks sat on a 47 41 lead that the advantage was not bigger was a testament to the magnitude of the knicks offensive slumber as they failed to capitalize on chicago 's horrendous start the bulls losers of 8 straight games and 16 of their last 17 outings missed their first 12 shots going without a made field goal for the opening 6 minutes 36 seconds once chicago got going though it rode the strength of brand the rookie power forward to competitiveness brand used a nice arsenal of post moves to score 17 of his game high 22 points and get three fouls apiece on kurt thomas and camby in the first half rebounds the queens native ron artest a rookie small forward for the bulls had a poor outing going scoreless in 32 minutes artest a st john 's product whom knicks coach jeff van gundy wanted to draft last summer entered the game with season averages of 119 points and 43 rebounds patrick ewing played with the flu scoring 12 points and grabbing 9 rebounds
