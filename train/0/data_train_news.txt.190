 for three straight years alonzo mourning has had to walk off his home court in miami while watching the hated knicks celebrate a playoff victory that ended the heat 's season he does not want it to happen a fourth time and based on the moves miami has been making recently there is a good chance it will not mourning was at the nba store in manhattan yesterday and he was naturally asked about the deals the heat has made or will soon make that will produce a starting lineup next season of mourning tim hardaway eddie jones anthony mason and brian grant it is a lineup that under the play hard or play elsewhere approach of coach pat riley may make things tough on everyone else in the eastern conference asked about the deals yesterday mourning said i had an idea but i did n't think it would be of this magnitude it looks good on paper but you do n't know until you hit the floor i hope we can develop some chemistry quickly and that these guys can learn riles 's system it 's the toughest system in the league mourning said he was excited that jones a 6 foot 6 inch guard had been acquired by the heat in a deal with charlotte that also brought mason to miami but forced the heat to give up pj brown and jamal mashburn jones is an all star in this league but people underestimate his defense mourning said he 's led the league in steals the last two years and that 's what we emphasize as for mason and grant who will soon go to the heat from portland in a three way deal that by league requirements can not be completed for another week mourning said the bigger the better mason knows riles 's system and that 's a help grant 's work ethic is impressive i see similarities to myself in him he 's got a great attitude and he gives such an all out hard nosed effort fred bierman
