 the plans and hopes of other teams aside this baseball year could end in no better manner than to have the arizona diamondbacks and the boston red sox win their respective league pennants so that randy johnson and pedro martinez can pitch against each other in games 1 4 and 7 of the world series what more fitting climax could the season have than to put the premier pitcher in each league on the mound in the sport 's ultimate set of games although that 's the only way johnson and martinez could pitch in the same meaningful games they have been mirroring each other this season making four starts on the same day and another start on consecutive days in their latest turns in their teams rotations johnson is scheduled to pitch against san diego tonight and martinez against tampa bay tomorrow afternoon johnson the left hander will take a 6 0 record and a 091 earned run average into the game in phoenix martinez the right hander will take a 5 0 record and a 127 era into his game in boston martinez has made one fewer start than johnson because the red sox were rained out for four consecutive days last month both pitchers have been no less than terrific they clearly have become the most dominating most intimidating pitchers in their respective leagues the similarities are they are both intimidating mike hargrove the baltimore orioles manager said by telephone yesterday the differences are how they go about it hargrove was asked to compare the two pitchers because as a long time american league manager he has had to deal with both during the regular season and in playoff games randy is physically intimidating hargrove said here 's a guy 6 foot 12 or whatever he is 6 10 and when he lets the ball go it looks like he lets it go halfway to the plate that 's intimidating especially to left hand hitters pedro goes about his business quietly on the mound but there 's no doubt in your mind that pedro feels he owns the entire plate and if you try to take any of it away from him he 'll come and get you that 's what martinez did last sunday in cleveland with einar diaz his brushback pitch led to an exchange of hit batters and a five game suspension for martinez if his appeal is unsuccessful he presumably will fall another start behind johnson though not necessarily in stature and success johnson 36 years old leads the national league in victories era strikeouts 64 strikeouts per nine innings 117 batting average against 156 complete games 3 and shutouts 2 martinez 28 is tied for the al lead in victories and leads the league in era strikeouts 50 strikeouts per nine innings 127 and opponents batting average 173 neither has lost a regular season game since last august though the mets beat johnson in a playoff game last october since he lost last aug 31 johnson has started 11 games and been the winning pitcher nine times martinez has not incurred a loss since last aug 19 winning 11 of 12 starts and adding one victory each as a starter and a reliever in last year 's playoffs johnson 17 9 248 and martinez 23 4 207 were the 1999 cy young award winners jim beattie general manager of the montreal expos knows both pitchers intimately he was in the seattle front office when johnson pitched for the mariners and he was the expos general manager who traded martinez to the red sox they both have a lot of confidence beattie said they do n't let anything bother them randy is more emotional out there but it does n't affect how he throws his next pitch it 's the same with pedro they 've gotten past those things that 's the mark of a good pitcher beattie a former pitcher himself said neither johnson nor martinez was born on the pitching pinnacle they worked hard to get there it was probably 1994 '95 when randy started to step it up and concentrate beattie said he worked hard in the off season he started applying himself and got stronger the same with pedro he worked hard conditioning for both these guys is outstanding people who do n't know the pitchers beattie suggested might look at both pitchers and think johnson was just this tall skinny guy and martinez was a small skinny guy both however are very strong he said you saw the maturing of both into the pitchers they have become the expos executive said both had questions about them early in their career but they developed mental toughness and concentration it 's something they learned as they got more experienced early in his career after the los angeles dodgers decided he was too small to become a good major league pitcher and traded him to the expos martinez was accused of being a headhunter he hit batters with pitches liberally and the batters went after him i do n't think he was a headhunter beattie said i think his ball just ran so much that he ended up hitting a lot of guys he has refined the way he approaches the game so has randy russ davis a san francisco infielder played with johnson in seattle and has played against him as a member of the yankees and the giants he 's gotten so good right now said davis who does n't have a hit in 11 at bats against johnson i do n't ever remember him throwing a sinking fastball a two seamer that just runs away from right handers now i thought that was pretty incredible when he came here and i saw that other than that pitch everything 's real hard a hard slider it 's hard to detect if it 's a fastball or a slider and he pitches he 's not just throwing 95 every time it 's like he 's getting better with age with time hargrove has n't had to deal with johnson since he left the american league during the 1998 season sight unseen though the baltimore manager said johnson is the best pitcher in the national league but he added without a doubt i think pedro 's the best in both leagues he 's kind of a combination of maddux and johnson he has johnson 's fastball but maddux 's composure and control
