 coach jon gruden is not sure what more he can do to inspire the tampa bay buccaneers to play up to last season 's super bowl winning form gruden has used virtually all of his offensive players in an effort to spark the buccaneers anemic attack and he went for a motivational home run the week before sunday 's 20 13 loss to the green bay packers which dropped tampa bay to 4 6 with six games left gruden had lou piniella the manager of the tampa bay devil rays talk to his athletes gruden also showed clips of heroic feats by michael jordan reggie jackson tiger woods larry bird and kirk gibson then he put the rock a 100 pound boulder symbolic of last season 's successful work ethic in the middle of the locker room what he got in return was another penalty filled game more crucial defensive breakdowns and more offensive futility the buccaneers have not scored a first half touchdown in their last three games all losses draining man draining gruden said monday it sucks the life right out of you it 's hard to stand down there but hey welcome to reality it is what it is and there are a lot of teams in similar straits as the tampa bay buccaneers that does not make the cloud over the buccaneers any less ominous on sunday the buccaneers saw many of their fans turn on them with a fury booing when tackle kenyatta walker extended his predilection for flags with a face mask penalty in the second quarter they then booed louder when wide receiver keyshawn johnson gestured for them to stop johnson said he had not seen fans act that hostile toward a home team since his rookie season with the jets in 1996 everybody is not strong johnson said some people crumble under pressure they do n't need to put more pressure on the kid he said of walker but fans do n't ever understand and they do n't ever know they 're so fickle the buccaneers probably need to win their last six games to have a shot at making the playoffs most tampa bay area newspapers declared their playoff hopes dead after sunday 's loss a columnist in the st petersburg times said the bucs were 4 and 6 feet under gruden said that the buccaneers confidence had taken a major hit particularly in recent weeks when you three putt three greens in a row you do n't look at that 18 footer on no 4 like you 're going to drill it now gruden said you 've got to be realistic third and 1 and you do n't make the first down you get a penalty and get backed up you fumble the ball guys do n't do cartwheels with great confidence on your sideline trying to become the first team to repeat as nfl champions since denver in 1997 and 1998 has turned out to be an albatross for the buccaneers it 's my first experience and i can say it 's a challenge gruden said there are certain expectations that you 've got to live up to and you 're going to get the best silver bullet that everybody has to offer gruden talked monday of tinkering with his personnel on defense the team 's most accomplished unit and cracking down on repeat penalty offenders you can levy fines you can lengthen practice you can have one on one conversations you can scream and yell and you can sometimes replace players who commit consistent penalties gruden said all those things will be considered if we 're going to run a disciplined football team run one there are some matters that we have to get resolved gruden called the giants 4 6 who will play the bucs here monday night a talented team that probably has the same rotten stomachs tampa bay has he is looking for his team to show some resolve in that game stay together circle the wagons and find a way he said sounding like a man hoping to hold off the inevitable
