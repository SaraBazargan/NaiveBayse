 vinny testaverde will come and go play a series or two chip off the rust and check the health of his thumb in the jets preseason opener thursday night against the pittsburgh steelers then the real show will start often when a backup quarterback enters a preseason game the channel is switched not this year testaverde whose thumb is sore but functional will take a dozen snaps then one of the most eagerly awaited understudies in football chad pennington will finally get a chance to display all the progress the jets say he has made if this ends up being testaverde 's final season as a starter then this is pennington 's best chance to prove that whatever concerns the jets had last season about his viability as a starter have long since disappeared because testaverde is the unquestioned starter and pennington has attempted only 25 passes in regular season games the jets have pointed to their four preseason games as an opportunity to give pennington work and to gauge his progress pennington will play at least two quarters thursday and much of his time will come with the starting offensive line albeit a patchwork unit right now and the starting receivers i do n't have anything to prove or anything to show pennington said i know what i have deep down inside it 's time to let it all hang out that bit of swagger is what the jets have longed to unearth in pennington and what he has finally allowed to seep out this summer pennington 's play seemed to turn the corner after coach herman edwards said during minicamp in april that he still thought the quarterback was thinking too much the jets have implored him for a year to play as if he were on the sandlot to worry less about making mistakes and to just wing the ball during team workouts in june pennington seemed freer yet more in control while taking all the snaps with the first team while testaverde recovered from foot surgery in training camp he has been more confident and less hesitant about throwing while the quarterbacks will have the luxury of throwing to receiver santana moss who is completely healthy for the first time in his jets career testaverde and pennington will have to contend with the makeshift offensive line which will limit how deep in the playbook the jets venture with center kevin mawae and right guard randy thomas out with shoulder injuries there are four new starters on the offensive line the rookie jonathan goodwin at left guard j p machado at center dan goodspeed who was signed from the san francisco practice squad last december at right guard and kareem mckenzie a first year starter at right tackle the quick dump pass can not go quickly enough you have to understand who is in front of him edwards said of pennington we do n't want to put him in a situation where your team gets the ball and he 's running for his life this is when you gain your confidence when chad drops back he has to see someone is open and just throw it he has done that the last month and a half and now he has to do it in a game pennington knows that until he does it in a game the questions about his future as the jets starter will linger his performance in the 2001 preseason did little to ease those concerns which is why the jets have pointed to these games since the end of last season as a training ground for pennington in two preseasons pennington is 56 of 97 for 735 yards with a touchdown and 2 interceptions everybody 's wondering what 's going to happen with chad pennington said about himself is he ready i do n't know i have to prove it on the field nobody knows what chad pennington can do on the field because we have n't seen chad pennington on the field i have two roles my first role is similar to last year and the year before it 's a backup role but my second role is to be ready to become the starter if that ever happens extra points linebacker sam cowart hamstring who has not practiced since the first day of training camp will not make the trip to pittsburgh john abraham knee dave szott knee and david viger calf will not travel either edwards said he was not disappointed that cowart who is returning from an achilles tear last season is still not well it would be more disappointing if we lost him for the year edwards said right guard randy thomas shoulder and offensive tackle jumbo elliott quadriceps will not play but will make the trip the rookie defensive end bryan thomas will play with the first team defense on the nickel package but will play on first and second downs with the second team defense edwards said he wanted to see how thomas played against the run the defensive starters will play 10 to 15 snaps tory woodbury will take over for chad pennington at quarterback in the middle of the third quarter the jets met with mark bartelstein the agent for kevin mawae to begin negotiations on a new contract mawae is eligible to become a free agent after the season
