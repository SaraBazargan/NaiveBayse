 it 's almost official the economy is in recession ending the longest uninterrupted expansion in american history the official dating of the recession the 10th since world war ii is expected to come as early as monday from the national bureau of economic research in cambridge mass long considered the arbiter of economic contractions and expansions the six members of the recession dating committee discussed the issue in a conference call yesterday the economists on the committee agreed not to talk about the decision but an announcement is scheduled for monday and a few now say that they think the economy is in a recession they had indicated earlier that the most likely starting date for the recession is march my personal opinion is that a recession has begun jeffrey frankel an economist at the kennedy school of government at harvard said after the conference call but he declined to say when he thought the recession had started or what the committee had decided but even before yesterday 's discussion some new economic data including a surge in october retail sales and a decline in initial jobless claims had led a number of forecasters to predict recently that the recession would be relatively mild and less severe than they thought earlier this shift in attitude has helped push interest rates higher as many investors are now behaving as if the federal reserve will soon stop cutting short term interest rates so aggressively at the same time stocks have rallied in anticipation of a recovery the dow jones industrial average is up nearly 21 percent since its post attack low on sept 21 while the nasdaq composite index has jumped 337 percent since its low still many economists are convinced that the economy may remain bogged down for a while and that any recovery might also be relatively modest there is some weakness left to come said richard berner chief united states economist at morgan stanley dean witter he expects a 35 percent decline in the economy in this quarter much sharper than the consensus view americans have not experienced a single full quarter of contraction in the total economy since early in 1993 and then the dip was just 01 percent the last recession as the research bureau defines it ended in march 1991 after starting in july 1990 the official announcement of the latest recession will come as no surprise before the terrorist attack on sept 11 many economists already thought the economy was in a recession or on the verge of one the attack and its aftermath made that opinion nearly unanimous the committee is expected to date the beginning of the recession as far back as march of this year when the growth in employment one of the research bureau 's four main economic indicators peaked if that is the date then the record expansion lasted almost exactly 10 years if this recession ends in the second quarter of next year which many economists are forecasting then it will last about a year average for recessions since the end of world war ii the dating of recessions is always done cautiously the research bureau 's business cycle dating committee as it is known usually waits until it has at least six months of data beyond what the committee determines to be the onset of a recession the dating of the start of the last recession was announced on april 25 1991 more than a month after the recession was already over as a simple rule of thumb many people define a recession as two quarters of consecutive decline in the gross domestic product while not official that rule has proved to be a pretty good barometer based on the latest gdp data the economy fell in the july to september quarter at an annual rate of 04 percent in the spring quarter economic output grew at an annual rate of 03 percent while in the first quarter which ran from january to march the economy grew at a 13 percent rate on average economists polled by bloomberg news expect the economy to contract at a rate of 08 percent in the current quarter the dating committee does not look at gdp data because those data are quarterly subject to major revisions and because it dates recessions by the month the four main indicators the panel considers are employment personal income minus government transfer payments like welfare industrial production and manufacturing and trade sales before yesterday 's meeting the committee had indicated in its most recent analysis of current conditions that only personal income was still rising its other main indicators for determining a recession had already experienced declines similar to those in past recessions the data continue to show substantial declines in real activity in manufacturing the sector reflected in the industrial production index and in real manufacturing and trade sales the committee said in a report on nov 9 aggregate employment has fallen substantially as well by about two thirds of the amount typical of earlier recessions among the four indicators only income has behaved differently from recession averages over the past seven months but in the end mr frankel noted it all comes down to the collective judgment of the committee there is no firm rule he said
