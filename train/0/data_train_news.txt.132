 when a significant figure dies somebody somewhere will inevitably invoke that hackneyed phrase the end of an era and while most of us wo n't know exactly what ended we will be dutifully impressed edward logue the bold master planner who died jan 27 in his home on martha 's vineyard at the age of 78 would probably have scoffed at cosmic language about his role in life but in fact he did represent a way of doing things that is long gone as is the generous era that allowed him to realize his big visions and do what he did best rebuild cities as saturday 's memorial service for him in boston reminded us there really could not be an ed logue today he was a powerful headstrong urban planner in the 1950 's and 60 's who figuring out how to grab every available penny of urban renewal money remember urban renewal reshaped new haven and boston then put his talents to work in new york in the late 70 's and 80 's as head of the state 's urban development corporation from 1968 to 1975 he built housing stadiums and more housing from buffalo to roosevelt island working free of local zoning and building rules thanks to his powerful mentor nelson a rockefeller and using federal and state largess as his checkbook today urban renewal means donald trump building towers of affluence on the hudson and east rivers federal dollars that built thousands of apartments for the poor and middle class have all but dried up we have no national housing policy that 's worth a damn in my view mr logue said three years ago when the country was already scornful of big government the munificence of the new deal and great society ed played those federal housing grant programs like a zither recalled stephen lefkowitz a lawyer who worked for the state he did what he wanted to do and trusted that the lord would make it work the lord and some optimistic accounting instead of financing each project individually securing the money before beginning construction mr logue would get financing for one project and start three there was always more money on the way and then in 1975 the government put a freeze on federal housing subsidies the banks called in outstanding loans and the urban development corporation went bankrupt mr logue was fired and did n't make his new york comeback until 1978 when mayor edward i koch brought him back to rebuild the south bronx a national symbol of urban decline he went way over budget as he turned the south bronx 's infamous charlotte street into charlotte gardens a new community of private homes the original idea was to build a large apartment building but mr logue thought home ownership was a better idea and while negotiating the political shoals of the bronx he built 90 subsidized homes as we were getting dragged in i was saying to myself 'what am i getting into mr koch recalled but it was the best thing we could have done it anchored the community charlotte street has come back and swaths of the bronx have come back with it would that happen today without a determined rule breaking ed logue probably not many lump him with robert moses and there were strong similarities but unlike mr moses mr logue was a proud liberal who brought his social conscience to his projects trying unsuccessfully to build integrated housing in westchester and staying for days in his housing projects in coney island harlem and elsewhere asking his staff members to do the same they were called live ins said mr lefkowitz it was supposed to give people who were doing the planning a better appreciation of how a project functioned what people wanted what it felt like to live there critics chief among them jane jacobs an urban expert considered mr logue to be a ruthless figure who imposed his will on communities in the moses fashion headstrong and willful he certainly was but thousands of new yorkers can afford decent places to live because of his public housing projects roosevelt island once an abandoned island in the east river is now a thriving community because of the logue stubbornness he unstuck a plan stalled for 20 years and built a diverse successful community where only weeds and old hospitals stood he 'd seen the bedraggled island from the window of his apartment on east end avenue and that was that he used to say that he loved nothing more than a cleared lot so that he could build big god knows mr koch said with a laugh heaven is going to be a different place 10 years from now
