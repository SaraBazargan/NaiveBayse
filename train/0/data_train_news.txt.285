 before he joined the huddle for what could have been the nets final practice jason kidd flung a two handed set shot from just inside halfcourt the ball spun over the continental arena court suspended for seconds in a rainbow of time and space that has spanned 101 games this season swish kidd smiled if only winning a game in the nba finals were that easy if only the nets knew before the championship series began what they know now well shaquille o'neal would still be 7 feet 1 inch and 350 pounds and the lakers would still be trying to win their third consecutive championship we ca n't go back and change anything nets guard lucious harris said wistfully that 'd be great if we could the nets will take their best shot wednesday night in game 4 at continental arena hoping to derail the lakers quest to sweep the series after bursting through the eastern conference the nets have run into a learning curve that has dropped them on the short end of a 3 0 deficit in addition to o'neal the swingman kobe bryant and coach phil jackson who is going for his record tying ninth nba championship the lakers hold one intangible the nets can not counter experience they understand what it takes to win at this level the nets kerry kittles said and it 's something that this young team is trying to adapt to and something we 're trying to learn from from early in game 1 when the nets froze with stage fright to late in game 3 when they prematurely celebrated a 7 point lead in the fourth quarter and the times in between when they slashed 20 something point leads to 6 or fewer only to fall short they have indeed resembled a team making its first appearance in the nba finals these were all points in a series that we as a team that 's been there recognize the severity of the moment or what the moments are that you need to capture and play well and they 're just learning that lakers forward rick fox said those moments are passing the nets by fox said until after the fact they 're recognizing 'wow that was a classic opportunity and we 're just a step ahead he added nets forward keith van horn admitted that games 1 and 2 in los angeles were a circus new jersey missed 11 free throws in game 1 10 in game 2 the nets have not boxed out and have watched the lakers outrebound them in every game by an average of seven that takes experience to understand how important each possession is lakers point guard derek fisher said neither o'neal 's arthritic right toe nor any nets defense has stopped o'neal from averaging 37 points and 13 rebounds a game when asked what the nets could have done differently kittles laughed and said stepped on shaq 's toe we 've been pulling out a lot of stops i think we 're running out of stops to pull richard jefferson said remember shaq is an unstoppable force and kobe feeds off of that short of signing up for acting lessons from sacramento 's vlade divac nets coach byron scott said his centers todd macculloch aaron williams and jason collins were not hip to that stuff yet macculloch is the only nets player with nba finals experience as a backup with philadelphia last season the sixers interrupted the lakers undefeated run through the playoffs by winning game 1 before the lakers won four straight closing out the series on philadelphia 's home court the nets hope to avoid seeing the champagne spray on their account they already survived reggie miller and the indiana pacers in double overtime of game 5 of the first round but no team has come back from a 3 0 deficit it 's almost written down as being impossible scott said but i also know that if we go out and compete and we do n't let our guards down and they let their guards down we win a game and then we win the next game then it 's a series again scott said six teams have swept the finals scott 's lakers were swept in 1989 but won titles in 1985 1987 and 1988 i could talk until i 'm blue in the face on what the championship is like and what the nba finals is like but until you actually get there and get to play in it it 's really just words he said for the lakers it is more than that now i think that swagger has come through experience jefferson said right now we 're just still trying to figure them out the nets might be learning too late for this year slowly we are climbing the ladder van horn said i think we are finally now at the point where we know what we are capable of and know what we can do against this team rebounds during his state of the nba address commissioner david stern said that the league would introduce instant replay next season for last second shots and that the games in the nba finals would start at 8 30 pm eastern time if the league realigns in the 2003 4 season the memphis grizzlies and the minnesota timberwolves have asked for travel convenience to be placed in the eastern conference in response to limiting shaquille o'neal 's dominance stern said i did say to one owner 'perhaps we would consider a sixth man
