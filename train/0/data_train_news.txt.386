 junior 's first night ever in shea stadium was a succession of loud noises first there were the airplanes he went out for early batting practice to get the feel of the joint and discovered the jets just outside of la guardia airport his father was talking to him but ken griffey jr does not read lips he had played in the dismal confines of the kingdome but had never experienced airliners screaming past at nearly eye level every minute or two the charm of baseball in queens it 's a little different junior said it 's a learning experience this all could have been his but junior refrained from saying thanks but no thanks the next aural intrusion was the irritating hum of reporters closing around him in the reds clubhouse dozens of them all intent on asking about his homecoming to cincinnati when trey runs around the ballpark it reminds me of running around when i was a kid he said the only difference was that i did n't have a grandfather saying 'hey come on we 're going in the back room and get something trey griffey 6 has that luxury a father wearing uniform no 30 the old number of ken griffey sr who now wears no 33 trey himself wears no 3 when he plays his own youth games the family is together now in the city where senior prospered i just want to win a world championship in that locker room where he did junior said nodding toward his father the reds bench coach the incessant buzz from the reporters was on whether junior had any second thoughts about turning down a trade to the mets last winter i really did n't have that option griffey said quite patiently i only had 15 minutes to decide they said they needed a decision by midnight i could n't make that decision he made the decision he really wanted signing a nine year contract worth 1165 million deferring nearly half to fit into cincinnati 's budget the reds are his hometown team he gave up the flight patterns of queens for the honor of going home i grew up 45 minutes from riverfront he said luckily i have a navigational device on my car fifth street walnut street i have no idea when i get to pete rose way i know i 'm home griffey said he has enjoyed being back in cincinnati he is living in a condo waiting for his wife and children to move up from florida at the end of the school year i 'm boring he said i get up and go to the ballpark he has been an all star 10 times has won 10 gold gloves was named to the 30 player all century team last fall and is a candidate to pass henry aaron 's home run record of 755 before he finishes but right now he is struggling he is batting 194 after striking out three times in last night 's 6 5 loss although he did take away a home run bid by derek bell reaching over the fence i 've been swinging at some bad pitches griffey said i 've got to be a little more selective he was asked whether he was affected by the change of leagues and he replied it 's only been a couple of weeks i 'm just getting my feet wet the other noise griffey heard last night was a modest by queens standards chorus of boos the fans can not understand how he could possibly have given up new york for the familiarity of home how could he do this to them quite easily it seemed
