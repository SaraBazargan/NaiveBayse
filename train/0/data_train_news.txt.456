 the slogan on dennis cook 's t shirt go hard or go home is faded as is the small florida marlins logo that accompanies it the mets left hander has not been a marlin since 1997 and this is the first time in his 12 year major league career that he has been with the same team three springs in a row but the fact that he wears another team 's shirt underscores the itinerant nature of his career and his game he may be on the move again shortly cook took part in the first day of workouts for mets pitchers and catchers today and he does not know how long he will be with the team he does not particularly care either not after being traded six times in his career cook would like to stay with the mets and complete his contract which runs through next year but he is prepared just in case that does n't happen i do n't want to get my roots too set in the ground because obviously something could happen and my name 's been in the papers a lot cook said i 'm not going to think about it one way or the other just get myself in shape and ready to pitch whatever it 's going to be it 's going to be i 'm not going to fret or panic over it the mets have 24 pitchers in camp including 11 left handers there are four experienced left handed relievers cook john franco jesse orosco and rich rodriguez and other teams regularly ask about them franco expected to be the setup man for armando benitez has veto power over trades and has decided to remain a met of the remaining three the mets would save the most money by moving cook and his 22 million salary it 's just going to boil down to do they want to pay my salary as a set up guy to pitch in the middle cook said that 's the decision steve has to make steve phillips the mets general manager said he will probably trade a left hander before the regular season starts and said six or seven teams are interested the seattle mariners have shown interest in cook in the past and the cleveland indians are also looking to add left handed relief then again the mets might do nothing manager bobby valentine said he could take as many as seven left handers on an 11  or 12 man staff presumably three starters and the four relievers we might not trade any of them and we 'd have a lot of lefties phillips said that would n't be the worst thing there 's a possibility that nothing will be done and we 'll wait until a later date history shows that the mets will get the best out of cook early in the season over the last three years he has a 246 earned run average in the first half and a 441 era in the second half last season cook wore down after working 41 1 3 in the first half of the season and in the second half his era was 623 he pitched only six innings in the final months of the season dave wallace the pitching coach stopped short of saying cook was overworked last year attributing the drop off in performance to a lack of confidence but he said he planned to talk to each pitcher individually this spring and he and cook will discuss ways for the pitcher to stay effective longer it 's an awareness that you address wallace said we 'll put our heads together and figure it out asked if he learned his personal limits last year cook shook off the question go hard or go home as the t shirt says there 's no such thing as personal limits he said when the manager tells you to pitch you pitch you ca n't tell him you ca n't pitch if there 's really not a whole lot of options down there we had to win games at the beginning of the year just like at the end of the year all you can do is go hard and hopefully have some gas in the tank at the end of the year inside pitch the mets have an arbitration hearing scheduled for 9 30 am thursday in tampa fla with the closer armando benitez who surprised the team by not reporting with the rest of the pitchers and catchers for the first day of workouts wednesday benitez was in baltimore wrapping up details of his case with his agent mike powers steve phillips said there was a miscommunication between the agent and the team and benitez will be in camp friday i 'd rather have everybody here bobby valentine said but it 'll be over real quickly baseball
