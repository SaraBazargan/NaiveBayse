 you know what they say about a little knowledge here 's some the greatest sprinters and basketball players are predominantly black here 's some more nobel laureates in science are predominantly white what do we conclude that blacks have natural running ability and whites have natural science ability or perhaps that blacks have natural running ability but whites do n't have natural science ability because that would be politically incorrect or perhaps that we can draw no valid conclusions about the racial distribution of abilities on the basis of data like these that is what modern anthropology would say but it 's not what a new book taboo why black athletes dominate sports and why we 're afraid to talk about it says it says that blacks dominate sports because of their genes and that we 're afraid to talk about it on account of a cabal of high ranking politically correct postmodern professors myself i am flattered to observe among them the book is a piece of good old fashioned american anti intellectualism those dang perfessers that plays to vulgar beliefs about group differences of the sort we recall from the bell curve six years ago these are not however issues that anthropologists are afraid to talk about we talk about them a lot the author journalist and former television producer jon entine simply does n't like what we 're saying but to approach the subject with any degree of rigor as anthropologists have been trying to do for nearly a century requires recognizing that it consists of several related questions first how can we infer a genetic basis for differences among people the answer collect genetic data there 's no substitute we could document consistent differences in physical features acts and accomplishments until the second coming and be entirely wrong in thinking they 're genetically based a thousand nigerian ibos and a thousand danes will consistently be found to differ in complexion language and head shape the first is genetic the second is n't and the third we simply do n't understand what 's clear is that developmentally the body is sufficiently plastic that subtle differences in the conditions of growth and life can affect it profoundly simple observation of difference is thus not a genetic argument which brings us to the second question how can we accept a genetic basis for athletic ability and reject it for intelligence the answer we ca n't both conclusions are based on the same standard of evidence if we accept that blacks are genetically endowed jumpers because they jump so well we are obliged to accept that they are genetically unendowed at schoolwork because they do so poorly in either case we are faced with the scientifically impossible task of drawing conclusions from a mass of poorly controlled data controls are crucial in science if every black schoolboy in america knows he 's supposed to be good at basketball and bad at algebra and we have no way to measure schoolboys outside the boundaries of such an expectation how can we gauge their natural endowments lots of things go into the observation of excellence or failure only one of which is genetic endowment but obviously humans differ thus the last question what 's the relationship between patterns of human genetic variation and groups of people the answer it 's complex all populations are heterogeneous and are built in some sense in opposition to other groups jew or muslim hutu or tutsi serb or bosnian irish or english harvard or yale one thing we 're certain of is that the groups of most significance to us do n't correspond to much in nature consider then the category black athlete and let 's limit ourselves to men here it 's broad enough to encompass arthur ashe mike tyson and kobe bryant when you read about the body of the black male athlete whose body do you imagine whatever physical gift these men share is not immediately apparent from looking at them black men of highly diverse builds enter athletics and excel far more do n't excel in other words there is a lot more to being black and to being a prominent athlete than mere biology if professional excellence or over representation could be regarded as evidence for genetic superiority there would be strong implications for jewish comedy genes and irish policeman genes inferring a group 's excellence from the achievements of some members hangs on a crucial asymmetry to accomplish something means that you had the ability to do it but the failure to do it does n't mean you did n't have the ability and the existing genetic data testify that known dna variations do not respect the boundaries of human groups to be an elite athlete or elite anybody presumably does require some kind of genetic gift but those gifts must be immensely diverse distributed broadly across the people of the world at least to judge from the way that the erosion of social barriers consistently permits talent to manifest itself in different groups of people in an interview with the philadelphia daily news in february mr entine observed that jews are overrepresented among critics of the views he espouses but is that a significantly jewish thing or is it simply a consequence of the fact that among any group of american intellectuals you 'll find jews overrepresented because they are a well educated minority there 's certainly no shortage of non jews who find the ideas in taboo to be demagogic quackery of course jewish academics may sometimes be speaking as academics not as jews likewise black athletes may perform as athletes not just as embodied blackness how easy it is to subvert michael jordan the exceptional and extraordinary man into merely the representative of the black athlete the problem with talking about the innate superiority of the black athlete is that it is make believe genetics applied to naively conceptualized groups of people it places a spotlight on imaginary natural differences that properly belongs on real social differences more important it undermines the achievements of individuals as individuals whatever gifts we each have are far more likely from what we know of genetics to be unique individual constellations of genes than to be expressions of group endowments jonathan marks teaches biological anthropology at the university of california berkeley and is author of human
