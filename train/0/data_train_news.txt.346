 back in 1979 i was a relationship manager at citibank for a multinational client in denver the client had problems in its south american operation so we decided an on site visit was necessary a senior manager at the client company said to my most senior executive at citibank larry small now head of the smithsonian we love doreen our little china doll but we do n't think women can be effective in the south american business world can you send a man instead larry finessed it he said we will send doreen but with her team leader who was of course a man i was amused to see that the bank 's key people down there were all women women still have to prove themselves over and over again though i wish it were different my dad was a diplomat from taiwan and when he was transferred to togo and cameroon my parents shipped me to boarding school in the united states i was 13 i did n't see them for five years no one ever thought it would take that long after i got my master 's degree in history from columbia i looked into publishing but was told by various publishing companies to start as a secretary instead i went to taiwan and got my first job at citibank selling english as my most marketable skill some things in life are serendipity in 1973 i followed my former husband to cambodia where he was on assignment for cbs news on the way we stopped in saigon and at a cocktail party there i met stanley cloud the time magazine bureau chief because his stringer war correspondent in cambodia had just been deported he asked if i wanted the job there are certain sights i 'll never forget like watching the royal cambodian ballet practice on the royal palace 's open air terrace a completely serene surreal moment in utter chaotic hell when i came back to the united states i had offers from both time and citibank i saw that journalism was great as a short term career but war correspondents tend to have terrible personal lives they 're usually waiting for something bad to happen i wanted to be the person who made things happen rather than the observer once i was rafting on the american river in california not a terribly difficult river but that spring the water was running stronger than usual the raft flipped and i zoomed downwater through a long gorge with one rapid after the other every time i was pushed down below the waves i just focused on being able to come up for air after 20 minutes i surfaced in a calm spot and managed to pull myself out of the water by then i was suffering from hypothermia but a few years later i went rafting again i needed to prove to myself that i was n't afraid
