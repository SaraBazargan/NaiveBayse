 an influential expert on global warming who for nearly 20 years has pressed countries to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat trapping gases now says the emphasis on carbon dioxide may be misplaced instead he and a team of scientists have concluded that the quickest way to slow warming is to cut other such greenhouse gases first this strategy could help policy makers overcome a fundamental conflict in the debate over global warming carbon dioxide the main heat trapping gas in the air is an unavoidable byproduct of burning fossil fuels like coal and oil and combustion of fossil fuels is the foundation of industrial societies the expert dr james e hansen and his colleagues conclude in a new analysis that the warming seen in recent decades has been caused mainly by other heat trapping emissions methane chlorofluorocarbons black particles of diesel and coal soot and compounds that create the ozone in smog which are easier to control than carbon dioxide with many of them already on the decline the team which reported its findings this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences found that the burning of fossil fuels although substantially raising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere also produces a pall of particle haze that reflects as much of the sun 's energy back into space as the release of carbon dioxide has trapped in the air dr hansen said the haze from combustion is likely to be cleaned up in coming years removing its cooling sun blocking effect said dr hansen who is director of nasa 's goddard institute for space studies and over the course of the century he added carbon dioxide levels will still have to be reduced to prevent further warming meanwhile emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities may be decreasing he said they shrank slightly in 1998 and 1999 even as the global economy grew as a result he said the world may find it easier and less costly to slow climate change than he and other scientists had thought at least in the short term the prospects for having a modest climate impact instead of a disastrous one are quite good i think dr hansen said in an interview some climatologists greeted dr hansen 's new paper with dismay saying they feared it would be misused by skeptics about global warming or by critics of a proposed treaty the kyoto protocol which would commit industrialized nations to big cuts in greenhouse gas emissions representatives of industries most vulnerable to restrictions on carbon dioxide welcomed the findings saying they raised provocative questions about the need for vigorous action on the climate the strong reaction is largely a function of the major role that dr hansen has played in propelling the greenhouse debate onto the public stage in 1981 he was a principal author of one of the first papers spelling out the links between rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and rising global temperatures in 1988 when a scorching american heat wave was at its peak and fires were consuming the amazon he testified before a senate committee that human activities were changing the climate in the analysis dr hansen and his colleagues culled data and scientific papers on topics from rice production which releases methane to urban pollution a source of ozone and sooty particles to obtain detailed estimates of the rate of change in different greenhouse emissions he then used established formulas for calculating how different amounts of the gases in the future would affect the inflow of energy from the sun and escape of heat from the earth carbon dioxide is by far the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere but the other gases dr hansen and his team cite are more prodigious trappers of heat moreover dr hansen said in contrast to the difficulties of controlling carbon dioxide technologies already exist for capturing or eliminating many of the other kinds of emissions these are much more tractable dr hansen said citing as an example existing systems for capturing methane produced by decomposing organic material in landfills also because many of these gases cause serious costly health problems or can harm agriculture there are strong economic reasons for wanting to eliminate them he said some scientists criticized aspects of the new study but agreed that an initial focus on the other greenhouse gases could achieve significant slowing of climate warming as long as carbon dioxide cuts were also made dr john p holdren a professor of environmental science and public policy at harvard university said any focus on cutting just one set of gases now would be a mistake this is not an either or problem dr holdren said it 's a both and problem we 're going to need all the cuts we can get the paper has prompted a significant amount of scrambling by scientists and lobbyists who are trying to shape the response to global warming several hundred scientists in dozens of countries are working on final revisions to the latest installment of a united nations assessment of climate change it also comes as the presidential candidates are being pressed by private environmental groups to add more detail to their positions on global warming vice president al gore has frequently cited dr hansen 's work in 1997 mr gore played a major role in negotiations in kyoto japan on the proposed treaty the white house said yesterday that the kyoto plan was the best approach to slowing warming adding that it placed equal emphasis on reducing all of the greenhouse gases largely because of insistence by american negotiators including the vice president gov george w bush of texas has said the kyoto proposals were inadequate and unfair to the united states a spokesman for the bush campaign ray sullivan yesterday called the new hansen paper intriguing adding that there were still questions to be answered dr robert t watson the chairman of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change said he had received a flurry of phone calls from other scientists in the last few days expressing worries that dr hansen 's study could be misportrayed they said this could easily be interpreted as the guy who got vice president gore all excited about global warming now saying everything 's fine dr watson said adding if this paper is viewed that way it 'd be a horrible distortion if anything our projections for warming are higher than they used to be and we 're seeing discernible changes in ecosystems that we can link back to climate representatives of industries that have sought to limit restrictions on fossil fuels said the paper poked provocative holes in the science behind the kyoto plan and other proposals to stem warming dr hansen stressed that he is still convinced that global warming is under way that people are a significant cause and that work should be done to cut the rate of change perhaps not quite as much work as researchers thought
