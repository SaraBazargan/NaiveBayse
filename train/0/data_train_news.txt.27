 the knicks have set their sights on the 6 foot 10 inch forward joe smith whose contract with the minnesota timberwolves was voided today by the national basketball association making him a free agent he 's certainly a great player and we certainly have interest in him general manager scott layden said tonight at halftime of the washington wizards 87 86 exhibition victory over the knicks we 'll certainly see if there 's a chance to get him here the knicks are over the salary cap so they can offer smith only the midlevel exception or 225 million a year layden said approximately half of the league 's 29 clubs can make the same offer while a couple of others can offer more dan fegan smith 's agent said that the knicks would be a good fit for his client he 's still looking at his options with other teams but new york is a situation that would suit him fegan said adding that he had spoken to layden tonight smith 25 is entering his sixth season he has averaged 145 points and 75 rebounds a game the no 1 pick in the 1995 draft smith averaged only 99 points and 62 rebounds a game last season as the timberwolves sixth man still smith has great potential and could help the knicks in their area of greatest need rebounding though mainly a power forward he can also play small forward and center particularly in the small eastern conference the miami heat which lost alonzo mourning for the season because of a kidney disorder could be able to offer smith 39 million if the league awards the club a disabled player exception the heat applied for it today the chicago bulls who reportedly have an interest in smith could offer him about 6 million fegan said if smith retained his larry bird rights a provision that allows a team to re sign its own free agent after three years even if the new contract exceeds the salary cap the timberwolves would be his first choice latrell sprewell could play a role in helping the knicks sign smith the two played together at golden state in the 1995 97 seasons and were good friends if he knows we 're interested he 's going to be willing to come said sprewell who called smith tonight i 've seen him quite a bit at minnesota and he 's a very good player layden said of smith he 's matured into a fine player i think he 's improved every year he 's highly skilled yet he does things that help a team win he looks like a guy who can play a number of positions rebounds coach jeff van gundy was upset with the knicks performance wednesday we 've got a lot of things to tighten the screws on he said guys were more worried about the world series than about tonight 's game chris whitney 's 3 pointer with 24 seconds left was the decisive shot for the wizards latrell sprewell who showed up 20 minutes before tip off led the knicks 5 2 with 23 points
