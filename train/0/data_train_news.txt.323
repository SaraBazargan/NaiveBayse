 after spending a day trying to talk their way out of a controversy the rangers found it far more effective to play their way out of it coach bryan trottier had been desperately trying to explain away a rift with center eric lindros going so far as to suggest that he was doing lindros a favor by benching him on sunday but nothing quite washed away the spat like a 5 2 victory over the edmonton oilers last night at madison square garden the crowd booed lindros lightly during introductions and finished the night raucously celebrating a rare offensive outburst by the rangers offense can cure a lot of ills a lot of ailments said mark messier who had an assist and a goal his seventh goal of the season matching last season 's total one of the things we never really anticipated was having a problem with our offense a quick two goal lead pushed that problem to the background and the victory turned the lindros situation into a footnote at least for a night all of it was a welcome break after three straight losses after the victory the rangers were 5 8 2 0 but dominating edmonton reinforced their notion that they had been playing better than recent scores indicated and it relieved a lot of pressure on lindros and trottier whose differences resulted in lindros 's extended benching sunday against st louis and in monday 's much publicized scrimmage in which trottier played on a line with lindros in a let bygones be bygones gesture by yesterday 's skate trottier was saying he had benched lindros in part to relieve the pressure building on his star i never had any doubts about eric trottier said he 's a great athlete and an important player on this team but last night 's on ice turnaround had little to do with lindros it was crafted by the unlikely scoring line of petr nedved radek dvorak and ronald petrovicky who combined for two goals and four assists the rangers were helped by a leaky performance in goal by tommy salo who was pulled after two periods in its first three shifts nedved 's line gave the rangers a 2 0 lead on goals by nedved and dvorak the first came on a nifty give and go by petrovicky and nedved 3 minutes 4 seconds into the game dvorak 's goal came five minutes later on a pass from dale purinton the players landed on a line together because trottier has been scrambling them looking for an offensive spark lindros 's final line was one assist on messier 's power play goal in the second period and 20 28 of ice time more than any other rangers forward he also took another third period penalty which was not quite so glaring thanks to the 5 2 score at the time we went back to basics lindros said we got the puck cycling out there i felt good out there hidden in all that offense was a solid defensive effort the key moments of the game may have come during a five on three power play by the oilers midway through the first period trailing by 2 0 edmonton drew a tripping penalty on petrovicky and called for a measurement of nedved 's stick which was ruled illegal the oilers though could not convert despite six shots on rangers goalie mike richter that was important rangers forward rem murray said they get right back in the game if they make it 2 1 that gave us a big lift going forward the oilers have not started the season well falling to 3 5 3 1 and salo had a nightmarish game he gave up a breakaway goal to mikael samuelsson and a crushing goal to murray with one second left in the second period it looks like we got surprised in our end too much edmonton coach craig mactavish said five goals by the rangers was a surprise all around slap shots forwards dixon ward and ted donato played their first game since being called up from hartford in place of defensemen jamie lundmark and rico fata who were sent down monday rangers defenseman tom poti traded from edmonton for mike york last season played against his former team for the first time he had two assists york had one assist
