 baseball owners adopted an unbalanced schedule for 2001 yesterday meaning teams will play an increased number of games against teams within their divisions there will be no league realignment until at least 2002 however under the new schedule the mets and the yankees will play 19 games against each of the other four teams in their divisions they will also continue to play each other in interleague play six games are on the current schedule but that number can change the schedule has the same divisional interleague pairings that have existed for four years but schedule makers continue to work on a plan that would rotate division pairings for next season if the rotation is worked out the mets and yankees will play only three games said katy feeney one of the schedule experts
