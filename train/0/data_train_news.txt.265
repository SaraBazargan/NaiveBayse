 jeff weaver was back in the clubhouse after giving up six runs in seven innings out on the field his new yankees teammates were finishing an easy victory over the toronto blue jays it must have seemed absurd it is not like this where he comes from jason giambi was also in the clubhouse at yankee stadium done for the day after a double a triple and two runs batted in incredulously and rhetorically weaver asked him all i 've got to do is stay in the game and i get a 'w here yesterday as it often is with the yankees that was true weaver won his yankees debut 10 6 despite allowing three runs in the first and three in the fifth he was perfect in his other five innings and mike stanton retired all six hitters he faced at the end of the game when the blue jays hit weaver they hit him hard but the yankees muscle made it moot it 's a whole different ballgame for sure said weaver who had spent his career with the hapless detroit tigers before friday 's trade to the yankees i have n't seen 10 runs all year the tigers have not scored 10 runs in any game this season the yankees lead the majors in runs scored weaver has a losing record this season 7 8 and for his career 40 51 but that figures to change soon he comes at you at a weird angle none of his balls go straight and he throws hard said derek jeter whose two run homer in the sixth put the yankees ahead to stay you do n't like facing him so you might as well get him on your team that is what the yankees did though the trade did not come easily the yankees had identified weaver to improve their aging rotation earlier this season but the tigers wanted first baseman nick johnson in return and the yankees would not trade him the yankees still hoped to make a deal with prospects but after injuries last month to pitcher brandon claussen and outfielder juan rivera the yankees needed a third team to make a deal the oakland athletics obliged getting weaver for first baseman carlos pena a prospect and a player to be named then shipping him to the yankees for pitcher ted lilly and two prospects the quality of weaver 's stuff was obvious to the yankees and general manager brian cashman received positive reports about his makeup weaver competes intensely showing emotion on the mound and a scowl in the clubhouse on days he pitches fire and brimstone blood and guts cashman said those are the words that came to mind when i asked a lot of questions from a lot of people i engaged anybody who was close to him and they all told us the same thing he 's competitive to a fault if you can be weaver showed that by his reactions yesterday when vernon wells ripped a hanging curveball for a three run homer in the fifth weaver never turned to watch it he took a few slow steps in front of the mound clenching his fist raging he sat alone in a corner of the dugout manager joe torre caught him screaming into his glove as he walked off the mound weaver told himself to stay calm as he warmed up in the bullpen but when he took the mound in the first inning in front of 46922 fans he was excited and left his pitches high wells blistered the first pitch to the warning track for a double and carlos delgado smoked the ninth to center for a three run homer you do n't want to continuously hear the boos in the stands but i was expecting it and i was glad to hear it weaver said it got me back where i needed to be once i 'm able to settle down there will be a few more wins there is already one thanks largely to jeter whose homer off corey thurman 1 2 was his first hit since missing two games with a sprained left knee it was the highlight in an otherwise boring day for jeter who hated his first career start at designated hitter what was he doing between at bats eating jeter said if i was a dh i 'd be 300 pounds by august but jeter is healthy again torre said and he will almost certainly be back at shortstop after the all star game break that is when the yankees resume their rumble toward october with an overwhelming offense and a new pitcher who is happy to have the run support but promises to improve i shook his hand and he said 'it 'll get better torre said of weaver but it was fine for me today inside pitch andy pettitte will start the first game after the all star game break in cleveland on thursday followed by roger clemens david wells and mike mussina manager joe torre who has six healthy starters for five spots would not commit to anything beyond that with so many teams needing starters orlando hernandez could be traded before the july 31 deadline perhaps to the expos i think they 'll trade him in a minute said an official of one team that needs a starter the yankees would like to make a trade similar to the 1999 deal that sent hideki irabu to montreal for a package of prospects including ted lilly torre said he would try to play all the yankees infielders at the same time for at least one inning in tomorrow 's all star game alfonso soriano may play the whole game at second torre said but robin ventura has volunteered to back him up of the 75 games on the yankees schedule in the second half 54 are against teams with a losing record
