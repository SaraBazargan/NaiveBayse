 michael doleac 's signing by the knicks as a low priced free agent this summer hardly made a ripple next to the draft day deal that brought antonio mcdyess to new york doleac 's injury a strained hamstring sustained on the first day of camp brought far less interest than mcdyess 's season ending knee injury or latrell sprewell 's broken hand but while mcdyess is gone for the season and sprewell 's future is uncertain doleac participated in the knicks practice session today and said he would be ready to contribute when the knicks open their season wednesday in detroit that may not excite fans of a team of which little is expected but the 6 foot 11 doleac is not exactly cowering at the prospect of making his initial appearance as a knick i just come out and play he said everyone talks about the new york media and pressure and fans i do n't care i 'm here to play basketball play hard and have fun if doleac seems poised to make a quiet debut consider that he was unrecruited out of high school chose the university of utah after attending a basketball camp there and wound up as the 12th player selected in the 1998 national basketball association draft after enjoying success playing for rick majerus at utah doleac has drifted through his first four professional seasons three in orlando and then last season in cleveland he has averaged 62 points and 37 rebounds in 169 minutes a game you 're not going to win every game or lose every game doleac said but if you play hard you 're going to give yourself a good shot at being successful that 's just what i learned from majerus on down if you step on the court go hard and the other stuff takes care of itself after a preseason that seemed more useful to the career he aspires to as an orthopedic surgeon doleac was back banging in practice it was nice to hit some people today said doleac who will be counted on for defense and rebounding as a backup center you 've just got to roll with the punches and make the best of the situation i 'll be fine i just have to keep working i tried to pay attention best i could so i know the plays i know the concepts i know how it 's supposed to work the knicks who have 15 players on the roster have until 6 pm monday to cut down to 12 active ones sprewell 's status is uncertain latrell sprewell will accompany the knicks on their initial road trip to detroit and philadelphia but he is uncertain whether he will do so on the injured list or whether he will even wear a knicks uniform again despite statements by scott layden the team 's president and general manager that sprewell will play for the knicks sprewell is not convinced i do n't know sprewell said today that 's something at this point i ca n't control never have been able to control if it happens it happens if not i 'll be here trying to help the team just when that help will come is uncertain too on friday sprewell said that he would not rush back from his broken right hand a point he repeated today on thursday he said he would have his hand re examined and x rayed on tuesday but today sprewell did not have a date figured out for the exam sprewell said that allan houston and kurt thomas would have to carry the knicks until he returns but he also said that if the knicks plan to use the medical exception for salary granted by the league in the wake of antonio mcdyess 's injury a big body would be the way to go we 've got enough small guys he said especially if i can get back and lavor postell is healthy as well i know he 's anxious to get out there and prove something i think if we get everybody healthy it would be wise to get a big guy
