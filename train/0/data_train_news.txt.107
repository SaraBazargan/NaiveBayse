 if it seemed only a few weeks ago that pete rose was hustling back into baseball 's good graces he now appears to be running in place a baseball official said yesterday that recent revelations about tax and gambling matters involving rose had slowed the process by which commissioner bud selig would determine whether to remove rose from the permanently ineligible list it has slowed down to nothing the official said rose keeps shooting himself in the foot no the heart there 's so much stuff coming out everything is being thoroughly reviewed even if rose is able to withstand the recent revelations they will apparently have some effect on his status the official said if selig reinstated rose he would place him on probation for longer than he otherwise might have perhaps two years he would want to see what comes out the official said that 's why if a deal is made and right now it 's a big big if rose would be on probation for a lot longer than a year the rose review more accurately the investigation is being conducted by martin weinstein a washington lawyer with foley lardner the firm where bob dupuy baseball 's president and chief operating officer is a partner weinstein declined to comment yesterday on the rose inquiry saying he would neither confirm nor deny it but the baseball official confirmed the involvement of weinstein a former assistant united states attorney in atlanta another official said baseball was trying to verify comments or behavior that would belie rose 's reported change in lifestyle when a bartlett giamatti then the commissioner banned rose in 1989 he said rose would have to reconfigure his life to have a chance to return to baseball fay vincent who succeeded giamatti and john dowd the washington lawyer who led the original investigation of rose and his alleged gambling said yesterday that they had spoken to weinstein several years ago the commissioner 's office in fact has been looking into the rose matter one of the officials said since he applied for reinstatement in september 1997 he came here and spent a lot of time vincent said of weinstein in a telephone interview he spent a fair amount of time with john he told john if anything he came away convinced there was more evidence since he did the investigation and that it was clear that rose bet on baseball dowd said weinstein checked out the dowd report and came to see us when he was done adding in a telephone interview he had some minor questions but fully agreed with everything we came up with dowd said thomas ostertag baseball 's general counsel joined weinstein at the meeting which he said lasted about half the day weinstein is looking into reports that have surfaced in the last eight weeks since selig 's nov 25 meeting with rose in milwaukee became known his continuing behavior makes it more complicated one official said the commissioner 's office the official said has mixed feelings about the meeting becoming public on one hand selig 's aides had hoped their deliberations could continue in secret but on the other the disclosure has produced reports that they would rather check out now than after reinstatement a major concern of selig and his aides is that damaging information on rose could emerge after his reinstatement less than two weeks after the milwaukee meeting became known the dayton daily news received a copy of a tape recording that was said to have been made in 1986 by a man described as a dayton gambling kingpin with close ties to the mafia the conversation on the tape dealt with rose 's gambling debts last month the cincinnati enquirer reported that the internal revenue service had placed a 151690 lien on rose 's property in california for taxes he owed from 1998 baseball could see an inability to pay taxes as a potential problem for rose a reason for him to gamble to try to make more money other reports have told of rose sightings at casinos in las vegas that 's the sort of thing weinstein will focus on gambling at las vegas casinos is legal but it is not an activity that would demonstrate to selig that rose has altered his lifestyle weinstein was also said to have recently interviewed tommy gioiosa once a rose roommate who has previously told about rose 's betting and other illegal activity selig has made it clear to rose that if he were to be reinstated he would have to admit that he bet on baseball an act he has denied for 13 1 2 years since he was banned from baseball one official said one of rose 's representatives told dupuy about a year ago that rose was prepared to make that admission weinstein served in the justice department in washington and with the united states attorney 's office in atlanta from 1988 to 1996 he then joined foley lardner where he is now head of the compliance counseling and government enforcement group baseball correction february 6 2003 thursday a sports article on tuesday about pete rose 's quest to be reinstated by major league baseball referred incorrectly to the role played by tommy gioiosa a former roommate of his in revealing information about mr rose 's gambling activities while mr gioiosa has spoken about those activities in a magazine interview he was never interviewed by martin weinstein a washington lawyer hired by commissioner bud selig to conduct an investigation of mr rose
