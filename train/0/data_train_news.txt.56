 there have probably never been more fascinating baseball monologues than the ones delivered by ted williams on hitting anyone who ever heard the man talk about hitting stood or sat mesmerized rapt hanging on every one of williams 's words to ask williams about hitting was to invite the baseball equivalent of a lecture on the theory of relativity by einstein or on the stars by galileo the only thing williams did better than talk about hitting baseballs was hit them in 1941 williams hit 406 sixty one years and thousands of players later no one has finished a season with a batting average that began with a 4 george brett batted 390 in 1980 rod carew 388 in 1977 larry walker 379 in 1999 todd helton 372 in 2000 wade boggs batted in the 360 's four times and then there was tony gwynn he batted 368 or better four times reaching 394 in the strike shortened season of 1994 if any latter day player was going to eliminate from williams 's name the appendage the last player to hit 400 it was gwynn it never happened the 400 thing i still ca n't see gwynn said a year and a half removed from his 394 performance it has n't been done in 54 years and i think there 's a reason why williams was n't simply the last to hit 400 he is the only player to hit 400 since 1930 in the major leagues and since 1923 in the american league putting williams 's feat in another perspective the home run record has been broken three times since he batted 406 when the home run record was still 61 gwynn was asked which he thought would be more difficult to do hitting 400 or hitting 62 home runs i think 400 is tougher he said in order to hit 400 you have to be pretty consistent all year long to hit 60 61 home runs all you need is a spurt i 've seen guys hit 10 11 home runs in a month you do n't necessarily need to be a good consistent hitter to hit 60 home runs i know home run hitters would disagree with me but to me hitting 400 is a tougher feat because you have to do it over 162 games two years later mark mcgwire broke roger maris 's home run record not with 62 but with 70 and three years after that barry bonds broke mcgwire 's record with 73 baseball still awaits a another serious flirtation with 400 consider four assaults on that magic number in the last quarter century in 1977 according to research by the elias sports bureau carew was hitting 401 on july 10 he batted a lusty 375 the rest of the season but fell short at 388 eight more hits in that time would have done the williams trick for him three years later brett was hitting 402 on sept 4 he batted only 323 the rest of the season and finished at 390 only five hits separated him from finishing at 400 in 1993 john olerud was hitting 400 on aug 2 instead of hitting 400 over the next two months he slumped to 290 and ended the season at 363 he would have needed 21 more hits to maintain his 400 average when the 1994 season ended after games of aug 11 gwynn was three hits short of 400 just three more hits anywhere along the way and he would have had his 400 season abbreviated though it might have been we were in august gwynn recalled later and we 're getting ready to get to the strike date and guys were telling me 'you got to go 10 for 18 or whatever we had a three game series with houston and i need to go something like 10 for 16 as it turned out gwynn went 6 for 13 and picked up just 2 points the mathematical lesson of batting averages struck home acting the opposite of a person 's weight points on a player 's batting average come off quickly but are difficult to put on as with home runs and hitting streaks players today face an obstacle williams did n't in 1941 at least not in quantity news media attention takes on a life of its own when a player is challenging a significant record or milestone dealing with the media would be the difficult thing gwynn said because when you get close they 're going to be all over you gwynn said that in 1994 he did n't get to experience that the season ended abruptly before his attempt to hit 400 could gather steam but he knew it was coming i knew if the season somehow was prolonged getting into september i was going to have to deal with that i would rather deal with the pitchers not giving me pitches to hit than dealing with the media part of it on the other hand in williams 's march to 400 he did not have the sacrifice fly rule working for him even if a runner scored from third base after a fly out unlike today the batter was charged with a time at bat available records do not show how many sacrifice flies williams had in 1941 but he certainly had some the league leading total of sacrifice flies in recent seasons has been approximately 15 if williams had 10 that season and they had been subtracted from his total at bats he would have batted 415 had he reached the final day doubleheader without those charged times at bat he would have been hitting 409 and would not have had to be concerned about playing so that he could legitimately in his mind hit 400 instead of doing it mathematically based on a 39955 average
