 the epiphany came late last season when kenny anderson was rehabilitating his sprained right ankle and heard the whisper about his demise as a player afraid that the boston celtics might trade him or worse bench him anderson decided to change his approach to basketball people were saying 'man what are we going to do with kenny anderson recalled after the celtics practice today so i had to sit back and say to myself 'what can i do to make this team tick and also get my minutes and also be productive i 've got to fit in because if i do n't i can be traded or i can be lost in the loop so i 've got to get with it i 've got to take less shots i 've got to get in where i fit in i 've got to play defense i 've got to be a team player ok i 'll do that and it 's gratifying because everybody sees that and it 's making the team work anderson 's decision has helped to catapult the celtics into the eastern conference finals against the nets and it restored his reputation in the process though he never lived up to his billing as another tiny archibald anderson like archibald late in his career is helping the celtics chase a title both players are left handers both were new york high school legends and both were high scoring point guards early in their careers running the offense with precision hitting big jump shots when necessary and playing solid defense anderson 31 has emerged as one of the feel good stories of the postseason he is the former wunderkind who found happiness as a team player anderson 's first step was to talk regularly with coach jim o'brien toward the end of last season after playing only 33 games because of the ankle injury and a broken jaw anderson told o'brien to expect a much better player during the 2001 2 season we had a lot of discussions at the end of last year o'brien said he was very disappointed in the year that he was having because he was injured he was not real happy with the condition he came in last year and he basically talked about people thinking that his career was winding down and that he was going to prove them wrong i said i have no doubt that you will scrapping his typical off season regimen of light and inconsistent workouts anderson lifted weights worked out with a personal trainer and did shooting drills religiously just as important he embraced the notion of being a role player realizing that paul pierce and antoine walker were the focal points of the celtics offense he put less emphasis on trying to rack up statistics and on outplaying the opposing point guard anderson who averaged 188 points and 96 assists a game during the 1993 94 season averaged just 96 points and 53 assists this season but he realized that life could be good outside of the spotlight the attention is off me said anderson who averaged 138 points and 44 assists in boston 's second round victory over detroit it 's on paul and antoine and it 's a blessing i really love my position on this team because when i came into the league i was the franchise guy i was the go to guy and it can be rough at times i just want to be one of the wheels that makes the team roll instead of the big wheel my numbers might not be big but i think my presence is big anderson the second pick over all in the 1991 draft played his first four and a half seasons with the nets and became an all star before stops with charlotte and portland he said he would not have accepted the lesser role earlier in his career it took me a minute to swallow the pill anderson said but now i 'm 31 years old i 've got 11 years in the league i want to win i want to compete i want to do whatever it takes to make a franchise do well and also do well myself i 've taken a back seat and i 'm willing to do that for the success of the team anderson said his new attitude had spilled over into his personal life and that it will be even sweeter when yes he said when the celtics win the eastern conference title it 's weird because away from basketball it 's humbling me anderson said it helped me with being a better person somewhat to understand the sacrifices when we win the eastern conference final it will be more gratifying to me it 'll be like 'wow i did it but i did it this way instead of the old way that kenny would have done it i can be this type of person
