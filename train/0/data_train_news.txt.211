 the nasa administrator defended himself today against suggestions in the columbia accident report that the agency had cut corners to meet a schedule he had imposed and he promised that the agency would achieve the major change called for in the report fixing its culture to one more amenable to safety concerns we get it the administrator sean o'keefe said using that phrase five times in the course of a 90 minute meeting with reporters to indicate that he understood that the problem with nasa was not the foam that fell on the columbia 's wing on liftoff or any other hardware issue but the cluster of attitudes and behaviors that led it to overlook the problem for years mr o'keefe said he thought nasa personnel who had safety questions felt free to speak up but he said some did so by e mailing him directly a sign that they do not feel comfortable raising questions with their immediate superiors the process to permit that discussion is n't happening at every level he said he said schedules notably for meeting milestones for assembling the international space station were a very valuable management tool but nothing more asked if he would resign he said twice he was personally accountable for what went wrong but he also said he served at the pleasure of the president president bush 's statement on tuesday about the shuttle report said that the next steps would be determined under sean o'keefe 's leadership which in washington usage meant that the white house did not want him to leave while the report named few names and explicitly avoided the idea of personal guilt for the feb 1 crash of the columbia hearings run by lawmakers who are more eager to establish blame will begin on sept 4 when the house science committee will hear from harold w gehman jr the retired admiral who is chairman of the commission that produced the shuttle report and several of the commission 's 12 other members the hearings will probably continue through the fall at the time of nasa 's first major accident the fire in january 1967 that killed three astronauts in a training drill in an apollo capsule on the launching pad the agency was led by james e webb then completing his sixth year on the job mr webb left in october of 1968 and his official nasa biography says he was personally tarred with the disaster at the time of the loss of the challenger the shuttle that was destroyed on liftoff in january 1986 nasa was led by an interim administrator william r graham who left office soon after the report on the loss of the columbia released on tuesday cited many contributing causes but said the launching schedule had become ever more compressed because of the plan to launch a critical section of the space station called node 2 by feb 19 2004 nasa employees told the investigators that the deadline came from mr o'keefe the report said and was part of a plan that he had proposed when he was deputy director of the white house office of management and budget his job before becoming nasa administrator in december 2001 the date seemed etched in stone the report said and nasa employees had a sense of being under the gun i was n't convinced that people were being given enough time to work the problems correctly one worker told the investigators in that atmosphere the report said a big chunk of foam fell off in an october 2002 launching and was classified as an action not an in flight anomaly had it been called an anomaly it would have received much more attention before the next launching that of the fatal columbia flight but mr o'keefe said today that since he took the job no shuttle launching had taken place on schedule and that there was no undue pressure schedules and milestone objectives are important management goals in order to achieve outcomes he said he called them an appropriate and necessary way to go about doing business and he said the agency would not rush back into flight it has plans to launch the next shuttle around the end of the first quarter of next year but he said today when we are fit to fly that 's when that milestone will be achieved william f readdy the associate administrator for space flight speaking to reporters in the lobby of nasa headquarters after mr o'keefe 's briefing said there was nothing wrong with deadlines and that nasa 's were less serious than many others do you all have deadlines he asked the reporters do you get to slip your articles if they are not ready we do he said referring to launching delays the sept 4 hearing is expected to explore schedule pressures and nasa 's contracts with the private companies that do much of the work on the space program which offer bonuses for on time launchings mr o'keefe said nasa had made an absolute solemn promise to the families of the seven columbia crew members and others to return to space exploration one finding in the accident report was that nasa 's ambitions have exceeded its budget asked today what it would cost to fulfill the recommendations of the investigation board as he has pledged to do mr o'keefe said it was too early to estimate mr o'keefe said he had spent four hours on tuesday with admiral gehman and other members of the board discussing the findings he has not finished reading the 248 page report he said but on his first look through it he found nothing surprising because it was similar to the statements made by the investigators over the last few months among nasa employees today the report was topic a asked if the broadside from the board had hurt morale one johnson space center shuttle engineer replied what morale then laughed and added no we 're doing pretty good he added mostly i have great trepidation about where we go after this who is going to lead us out of this o'keefe is probably going to keep us alive but who 's going to lead us out of here employees at kennedy space center in florida were also caught up in the report one engineer who has been working with the accident investigators on the analysis of shuttle debris said it had been a busy couple of days because everyone was trying to work and read the dense report too i printed it out yesterday and started going through it the engineer said we take a little time out to read it a little bit and then you dive back into what you were doing the report poses a challenge for nasa said the engineer who added everything 's out in the open now so what do we do to fix things
