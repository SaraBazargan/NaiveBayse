 it was the eve of minnesota 's opening game when coach glen mason got some unexpected good news the eligibility papers of his place kicker rhys lloyd had finally cleared and lloyd a native of dover england would be available for the season but the next day on the sideline when it was time to send lloyd out for the opening kickoff mason had a problem i could n't remember his name mason recalled i knew he was a brit and i 'm a big admirer of winston churchill so i just called out for 'winston until i got his attention mason certainly knows his name after lloyd booted two field goals saturday in a 20 14 victory over penn state that made lloyd 6 for 6 this season and helped stake the gophers to a 5 0 start moving them up to no 21 in the associated press news media poll farther south the whole state of arkansas should know who the sophomore backup chris balseiro is after he converted a 19 yarder in double overtime to defeat alabama 34 31 keeping the razorbacks undefeated and moving them to no 8 and finally there is tyler fredrickson of california who kicked a 51 yarder and had two attempts blocked before knocking through a 38 yarder that stunned no 3 ranked southern california in triple overtime 34 31 it has been an odd college football season marked by last week 's powerhouses becoming this week 's disappointments so it was fitting that kickers an often embattled and always anonymous breed made it even stranger the trojans 3 1 were supposed to be the class of the west they had an 11 game winning streak and national championship aspirations and had provided cal 3 3 with enough bulletin board fodder that the golden bears believed they were being overlooked they always take us lightly the senior receiver jonathan makonnen said they really do n't respect us in racing to a 21 7 lead cal got the attention of the trojans who rallied for 17 points and a 24 24 tie to force overtime near the end of regulation usc blocked a 51 yard attempt by fredrickson in the first overtime the trojans broke through to bat down a 29 yard effort that would have won the game while kickers quirky personalities are a part of football lore the kickers are often quite smart as fredrickson demonstrated on his game winner a 6 3 senior he looked like a quarterback barking last minute instructions to his teammates we moved the ball back about a yard said fredrickson a former walk on it 's not the way you 'd do things ideally but they had blocked two kicks it got to the point where i was going to do anything necessary to end this game i never doubted that last kick arkansas 4 0 turned to balseiro after the first string kicker david carlton missed two early field goals and the razorbacks fell behind by 31 10 midway through the third quarter in the second overtime however arkansas improbable comeback looked futile when crimson tide kicker brian bostick lined up for a 38 yard potential game winner it went wide left instead of being daunted by a raucous crowd at alabama 's bryant denny stadium balseiro a walk on assuredly made good on his chance to end the game it 's an amazing feeling he said i dream about this every day in a topsy turvy season in which oregon looked like a worldbeater one week upsetting michigan only to be trounced the next by washington state a national title may ride on the toe of an overlooked place kicker for evidence look no further than the top three spots in the polls trey dicarlo is 7 of 8 for top ranked oklahoma jon peattie is 5 of 6 for no 2 miami and mike nugent an all american last year is 7 of 8 for no 3 ranked and defending national champion ohio state this is not lost on mason he has found an extraordinary talent in lloyd who did not begin kicking a football until his senior year in a minneapolis area high school and spent two years in junior college refining his technique lloyd is the first gopher to handle kicking and punting duties since gino cappelletti did in 1954 lloyd already has two field goals from beyond 50 yards is 25 of 25 on point after attempts and is averaging 42 yards a punt with a continental panache in a nod to his soccer playing roots he rolls to his right and sidewinds his punts against penn state he recovered his own onside kick to open the game and later pinned the nittany lions on their own 6 yard line with a 51 yard punt he 's a musician with the ball and he 's earning his scholarship i can tell you that mason said but i still call him winston lloyd shrugs off his coach 's nickname i do n't mind as long as he calls me when we need points he said no doubt that in the coming saturdays mason will be calling on his kicker at critical times so will every other college coach how these specialists respond may be the difference between earning a spot in the national title game or not
