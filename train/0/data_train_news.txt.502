 mike shanahan the winning coach in super bowls xxxii and xxxiii has no plans to travel anywhere near super bowl xxxiv his team the denver broncos is the two time defending champion for only six more days either the tennessee titans or the st louis rams will take the broncos throne on sunday night for shanahan this is not a glorious idea or a pretty sight he will watch from denver scouring tapes and his notes on free agency breaking down the draft signing some veteran broncos releasing a few searching for that super mix that can once again plant him in the super game shanahan has been in six super bowls as an assistant coach in denver and san francisco and as the head coach in denver he can give the titans and the rams both wide eyed arrivals at the super bowl plenty to ponder this week the rams have been to the super bowl once in 1980 when they were based in los angeles the titans formerly the houston oilers have never been to the super bowl i 've watched a little about this game and i forgot about the hype involved shanahan said this morning by telephone from his office in denver when you 're coaching in this game you focus but being away from it for the first time in two years i see clearly the huge coverage and hype involved everybody feels good now but by the end only one team can feel that good shanahan continued there have n't been many super bowls when there was only one week to prepare that changes things significantly in the six super bowls i was involved in we had the game plan implemented the week before the game three times and won all three in the three we lost we did it the week of the game both of these teams must have had people last week preparing for this game making sure everything was arranged i wonder about the coaches and the game plans are some coaches going to stay back and arrive late to finish them i would think so only four of the previous 33 super bowls had one week between the conference championship games and the super bowl the last time was in 1994 super bowl xxviii between dallas and buffalo shanahan watched a bit of both conference championship games on sunday and said both the titans and the rams defenses were excelling that is the key ingredient he said to winning the super bowl tennessee has impressed me most because they have won five straight games against teams that have won 11 or more games shanahan said finding ways to win those kinds of games makes you uniquely prepared for the super bowl he wonders about the weather in atlanta this week temperatures are expected to hover near 35 degrees and snow is possible even though the game will be played in the georgia dome practices are scheduled for outdoors he said the setting for the players was also important how you have the team hotel set up for the players is critical shanahan said you want it as normal as possible we had an area set aside for the players that had video games pop and shot basketball pool air hockey and to watch extra game film the players need an outlet for the week on saturday night our players had their own rooms and their families were not allowed you want them the night before the game to be rested and not distracted i think last year the atlanta players had their families with them on saturday night we kept our guys busy up to curfew at 11 15 that night and then alone afterward then the game you try to do everything you 've been doing and not get caught up in the hype shanahan said you ca n't be too conservative you may have a few different plays a couple of different blitzes but you have to guard against overload you ca n't make it where the players are thinking too much instead of performing shanahan said there would be several important facets in the game for the teams are the defenses playing with confidence he said turnovers and ball security pass protect do n't allow cheap scores and make the other team earn it and penalties stay away from first and 20 or second and 20 concentrate during the game and do n't get caught up in the hoopla surrounding you in the stadium concentration is crucial for the young high flying titans and rams he said so often young guys who have n't been to the super bowl get caught up shanahan said i would remind them that this is not an award this is a work week you do n't go to the super bowl to just have fun you go to win the game it does n't matter that you 're there unless you win it i know from experience that if you do n't win the game people within a year will forget you were even there going into it you have to realize that 's simply the way it is and it can happen to you
