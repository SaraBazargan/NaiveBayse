 it is a relaxing four day four night stay in a small new england city complete with time for reading movies and self reflection management after all wants its guests to stay in bed until noon but there are catches no sunlight no exercise no visitors no minibar although the in room movies are free you can make an occasional phone call but receiving calls is not encouraged and those video cameras pointed at your bed just ignore them any takers the offer is from the sleep lab at wesleyan university 's department of psychology people who sign up will be subjects in two four day visits to the lab and be part of a two year study to analyze how the external environment affects the internal biological clock when completed the research results may help those with irregular sleep cycles mary margaret anderson a 21 year old wesleyan student got ready to take a four day plunge at wesleyan 's judd hall in july am i excited ms anderson asked well i think it 's going to be something different the objective of the study run by namni goel an assistant professor at wesleyan university and financed in part by the national institute of health is simple to measure whether and how sound can affect human circadian rhythms the 24 hour internal body clock normally our internal clock is in sync with the external environment dr goel said but when the two are out of sync as with overnight workers or jet lagged travelers the body clock says sleep the sun says otherwise and nobody 's happy for her study dr goel does her best to remove the variable of the external clock altogether hence the no sunlight rule because the effects of light as a stimulus have been studied dr goel chose another variable sound her subjects spend four nights in the lab and on two of those nights they listen to two hours of stimulus before or after going to bed depending on the study the stimulus is either bird song enhanced with music or sounds imperceptible to the human ear dr goel said it 's supposed to be relaxing so they do n't get bored because they have to listen to it for two hours dr goel said explaining her choice but the stimulus was not nearly as stimulating as one subject mei mei chan had hoped oh my god you have to sit there in this chair and it 's like she paused and stiffened music you just sit there it 's craziness she said laughing ms chan graduated from wesleyan this year and said she figured this would be a good way to fill time and help the university she also received 350 for participating on her first of two visits each subject must participate twice to make the data reliable ms chan watched at least 10 movies in four days the second time around she brushed up on her foreign language skills renting films in german and french and read economics books when she was in high school ms chan said she conducted her own psychology experiment she sent out a questionnaire about the colors people dream but my drawback was i could n't have people in a sleep lab and hook them up to see what color they dreamt in she said so my sophistication was much lower than this but in this experiment subjects enter the lab and the first thing they do after getting settled is have electrodes placed around their heads with an adhesive paste dr goel said the electrodes monitor sleep data every night from brain eeg 's to rapid eye movement to muscle movement in the chin ms chan 's first night was easy she got no stimulus so that her normal sleep patterns could be gauged but sleep on the second two nights was interrupted at 5 45 am with just enough time left for ms chan to don her dark glasses go to the restroom the eyes of the subjects can not be exposed to the light in the bathroom and freshen up before taking her stimulus seat at 6 am using body temperature readings salivary tests for the sleep related hormone melatonin and the sleep data from the electrodes dr goel analyzes the effects of the stimulus on the subsequent nights she found that the effects of sound on sleep are much like those of light a two hour dose of stimulus before bed as in the first study actually pushes the internal clock backward while the same dose after sleep will likely push the clock forward although dr goel is more concerned with the psychological effects than a real world application of her study 's findings her experiment does show that sleep patterns can be altered through sensory stimuli what that may mean is that people who have trouble sleeping could possibly find a nondrug induced way to snooze such as listening to music i know people who 've had problems with sleeping pills said daniel raimi 21 a wesleyan student and a subject for him should a practical application be derived from the experiments all the better i think it would be great for people to have a healthy alternative he said but all of the benefits of science aside being a subject in this type of study is n't exactly easy ms chan said at the end of the four days i just felt like ok this is worse than being a prisoner she said of her first tour you can do anything you want to do but you ca n't see light and there 's only so many movies you can watch when she left the building after her first of two four day sessions ms chan found a new appreciation for freedom but when she left the building after her second four day session her opinion had changed that is because beneath several of the electrodes on her face ms chan developed rashes dr goel said it was probably because ms chan had worn makeup and lotion one day something dr goel had told her not to do ms chan said the rashes were actually worse behind her ears where she applied no makeup she left the study appreciating its goals but lamenting her experience dr goel said that ms chan was the only subject out of more than 75 to develop a rash the subjects all agreed that the nicest part of participating was the isolation it provided the refuge from daily college life and college friends i 'm living with a bunch of students and i think it was good for me to have some time by myself said ms anderson who spent a good deal of her time watching movies as for mr raimi he spent his time practicing guitar but his guitar time and his earlier helping out the sick rationale notwithstanding there was still the cash payment to think of we have jobs but they 're part time and there 's a lot of things we like to do mr raimi said we have to have beer money we have to go to baseball games we have to buy cd 's for unemployed college students with nothing better to do the payment is attractive ms chan concurred but it 's really not attractive for somebody who has something going on in life she said most attractive of all though was leaving mr raimi said that was pretty exciting he said sounding relieved we got to be pretty close with the people administering the study but we were definitely happy to leave
