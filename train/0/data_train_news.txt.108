 more parts are officially peeling away from the yankees we knew about paul o'neill and luis sojo going home and staying home we figured that scott brosius tino martinez and chuck knoblauch would play elsewhere next season we realized that orlando hernandez might be given a new baseball address too but when these departures actually occur they can still cause a jolt joe torre made it obvious that the yankees did not want brosius two days after luis gonzalez 's 150 foot hit ended a dynasty and brosius made it just as obvious that he did not want to play anymore when he decided to retire that brosius will not play for the yankees in 2002 is no surprise that the 35 year old third baseman will be camping with his three children and not playing anywhere is since jason giambi will surely saunter through the same door brosius just strolled out of with about 120 million in his pocket some of the mystery about how the yankees will look next season will be solved giambi a hulking first baseman will provide an awesome combination of power and patience that the yankees have never had under torre the changes are necessary even if the yankees had won their fourth straight world series title these changes would have come o'neill never wavered even when there were whispers that he should push his body through another season sojo joked that it would take a 5 million contract for him to return martinez sold his house in tenafly because he knew what was looming before game 5 against the arizona diamondbacks brosius and knoblauch discussed ending their yankees careers with a fourth championship in four years it did not happen of course and now the yankees are making their greatest overhaul since 1996 as of today the yankees do not have confirmed starters at first base third base left field right field or in the final two spots in the rotation brosius retired because he wanted to spend more time with his family but he admitted that the myriad changes on the yankees told him it was time to depart too there 's a ton of things that go into the decision brosius said yesterday that certainly was a factor the team looks like it 's going to change its personality a bit but again those are all little things that come into play the no 1 factor for me was knowing myself i was just ready to start pursuing other things in a telephone conversation with torre brosius mentioned how the yankees were going in another direction and how it was his time to retire he talked about how we were going to have a different look said torre you have such fond memories of what you 've done here that you might want to leave with that i 'm sure that had something to do with it the yankees are preparing for the next era the giambi era o'neill talked about how the group that won four of the last six championships had its run and now it is over but the yankees o'neill said the yankees of derek jeter bernie williams mariano rivera andy pettitte roger clemens mike mussina jorge posada mike stanton and ramiro mendoza will stay formidable some of the other names will change add giambi and subtract martinez maybe add cliff floyd add a reliable starter and hernandez can be moved some of the names had to change for the yankees to improve listening to brosius talk about retirement was listening to a man at peace brosius sounded almost positive about retiring after the season and feeling what he needed to feel the first time he attended mass in mcminnville ore this was where he needed to be for moments like yesterday 's his children who were not allowed to have pets while the family kept two residences were giddy about getting a puppy still even brosius the family man hedged slightly about departing there was nothing left for him to chase brosius said but if the yankees had kept their dynasty cruising and were chasing a fifth straight title brosius 's kids might have had to wait for a puppy this decision was more personal than it was circumstances said brosius obviously if we would have won the series and there had been a commitment to try to keep everybody together for one more crack at it i think it might have been a little tougher to make that decision the circumstances and the yankees helped make it easier for brosius giambi is coming nick johnson will be a weapon floyd could be in left field brosius and others are gone brosius felt the season was not supposed to end with a loss and said we were supposed to ride off into the sunset after winning another title that is how george steinbrenner always feels that is why there will be plenty of new parts on an already strong team
