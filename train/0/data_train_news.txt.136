 major league baseball 's players union postponed setting a strike date at their meeting yesterday saying they would continue negotiations with owners some fans meanwhile have already adopted their own labor strategy instead of waiting for a strike to ruin the season they 've decided to ruin their enjoyment of baseball bashing the game has become a popular national pastime of its own the games are too slow the players are on steroids players and owners care only about money and besides with so many other happy diversions who needs baseball anyway there 's only one problem it 's all talk like the guy at the bar saying he 's better off without the girl when really he 's just trying to convince himself we would miss baseball consider the alternatives this is n't a void that the minor league facsimile of the game would be able to fill the new parks like keyspan park in brooklyn are charming but minor league games are forgettable mostly because the teams lack continuity in the majors players sometimes switch teams after a season or two but in the minors it 's the whole point players are in new britain today pawtucket tomorrow and if they 're lucky boston someday meanwhile alternate forms of summer entertainment especially on tv are ludicrous baseball has held steadfast even under the onslaught of increasingly outrageous reality tv and extreme sports programming it is true that baseball is slow but that makes it easy to follow it 's also undeniable that both the players and owners care a lot maybe too much about muscles and money but that should n't be grounds for banishment there 's consensus on the steroids issue players have agreed to testing in principle though the details are yet to be worked out money is a more pressing concern but those who would decry the avarice of the american ballplayer are living in a fantasy land life is expensive and professional baseball can be a grind at any level still many fans seem to think that because they once played the game just for the love of it major league players should too or at least be happy with whatever salary they earn this is preposterous many of us were in the school play too but there was n't the same outrage when the cast of friends the most effective labor union in recent memory banded together to demand 1 million an episode there might have been some grumbling but fans of the show at least were happy for them and yet when baseball players make huge salary demands the complaints are widespread even though a player 's career is shorter than an actor 's sure baseball may plod along indifferent to the world yet it retains its ability to surprise us in new and confounding ways remember the arizona diamondbacks now is not the time to give up on the game it 's time to remember why we love it cameron morfit writes frequently about sports
