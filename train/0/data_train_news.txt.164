 at midseason michigan seemed to be squandering its chance for a national championship or even for a big ten title the wolverines had lost two of their previous three games as they prepared to play minnesota everything about the game seemed odd they were playing at a strange time a friday night and in an unusual stadium the metrodome in minneapolis after three quarters they trailed the golden gophers by 28 7 our backs were to the wall steve breaston a wide receiver and punt returner said were we going to lay down and die instead of falling to the mediocrity of a 4 3 record the wolverines rallied for 31 points in the fourth quarter and won 38 35 it was the greatest single game comeback in team history after that they won their next five games and they will bring a 10 2 record into the rose bowl on thursday against southern california which is 11 1 although michigan won the big ten it has no chance at a national championship according to the bowl championship series formula which is heavily dependent on computer rankings that honor will be decided in the sugar bowl on sunday when oklahoma plays louisiana state the winner of the sugar bowl will be presented the trophy as the bcs champion immediately after the game but southern cal which is ranked no 1 in the associated press news media and usa today espn coaches polls can at least claim a share of the title if it finishes with a victory in the rose bowl over no 4 michigan it is unlikely that southern cal will lose its top ranking in the ap poll the trojans are playing in their home region and are favored what could possibly go wrong first time all year we 've been underdogs michigan tight end andy mignery said mignery and his teammates said little about their situation that could be construed as contentious or controversial wolverines stars like their leading rusher chris perry and their leading receiver braylon edwards did not even attend a news conference that was supposed to feature the michigan offense those who attended watched their words we 're kind of like a silent assassin quarterback john navarre said we do n't open our mouths tony pape one of navarre 's linemen was a little more loquacious the media 's overlooked us but i do n't think the sc team has he said if we won the game i 'd love to be no 1 mignery added this is the national championship game in regards to the human polls we 're not going to be able to touch the computer polls so should the wolverines claim a national championship with a victory that 's not up to me mignery said but i think we do have a case if the game works out if it works out for michigan it will be the climax of a turbulent season the team played better in the second half of the season in the weeks after clinching the victory in minnesota with a 33 yard field goal in the final minute by the freshman garrett rivas the wolverines beat their two major rivals michigan state by 27 20 on the road and ohio state by 35 21 at home unlike michigan teams of previous eras these wolverines have a balanced offense perry was a heisman trophy finalist after leading the conference with a 50 yards per carry average for 1589 yards in 12 games but the passing attack was also impressive edwards caught 14 touchdown passes and finished second in the conference with 625 receptions a game for 1031 yards in 12 games over all the pass attack averaged 2708 yards second in the league to michigan state 's 2795 although edwards led the team with 75 receptions perry was third with 42 many of them on screen plays it was this approach that sparked the comeback against minnesota the trojans are aware of how this short strike followed sometimes by a long run takes advantage of eager pass rushers kenechi udeze a southern cal defensive end said when they dump a screen off the center and the two guards leave early so you 're kind of dumbfounded it 's kind of a surprise because by that time they already have a couple steps on you they work their scheme very well they know what they are doing that may apply to this game over all the wolverines know they can play on the road in a loose frame of mind and spoil southern cal 's season in the trojans own territory melvin simmons a southern cal linebacker seemed to sense it when he said we have more to lose than they do
