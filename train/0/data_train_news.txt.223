 even before the mets lost 8 5 to the reds yesterday tension was swirling through the mets clubhouse as catcher mike piazza denied a report that said he was unhappy with the team the record of hackensack nj citing two unnamed sources reported yesterday that piazza was so displeased with the mets direction and their plans to gradually move him to first base that he wanted to be traded possibly to an american league team so he could catch and be a designated hitter tom glavine the story suggested has told ownership that he does not want to have piazza catch him when approached by reporters piazza sounded occasionally agitated but mostly incredulous people close to me piazza said what people why are you wasting my time with this you 've got to be kidding me i guess i 'm the monkey this week that 's pretty funny piazza smiled and added you 've got to fill lines with something right it 's like i 'm not even playing and i 'm the monkey it 's kind of cute i guess it 's flattering really it 's kind of like how do you answer something so far fetched it really makes no sense referring to a newsday story last september that alleged widespread marijuana use on the team piazza said you 've got to drum up something this week nobody 's smoking pot or anything that 's pretty funny i do n't know where that came from obviously but it makes for debate i 'm just trying to get back on the field that 's my only priority right now to play i have n't even thought about anything else except that piazza has two years remaining on his contract and can veto any trade because he is a 10 year veteran who has played five years for his current team he has been on the disabled list since may when he tore a groin muscle in a game against the san francisco giants piazza expects to begin a rehabilitation assignment within two weeks and rejoin the mets next month jeff wilpon the mets chief operating officer and the son of the team owner fred wilpon held a news conference in the press box in the sixth inning to say ownership has no intention of trading mike and i do n't know where the story came from it 's unsubstantiated the same with glavine talking to me or talking to fred he has not talked to either one of us ever he 's had no conversations that would even intimate that 's his feelings or that 's what he wants to do wilpon who flew back from the baseball hall of fame in cooperstown ny said he last spoke to piazza on saturday and was confident piazza was open to trying first base wilpon said piazza has expressed no displeasure at the move not that he said 'i 'm not going to do it not that he said 'this is no good glavine called the report a joke it 's not something to be kept in house it should be talked about it 's irresponsible al leiter said piazza 's unhappiness was understandable he 's unhappy that he 's not playing and not able to perform leiter said that 's obvious to anybody yeah he 's upset and mad it 's not a happy moment for any of us i do n't see him as an extra or being outside of that circle of being unhappy with everything that 's gone on other than you can add the fact that he 's hurt and has n't been able to help several players echoed leiter 's thoughts but one said he envisioned piazza seeing first base as a looming issue that he tried to handle last week by expressing a willingness to play it the player who requested anonymity said he could understand how an uncertain future could cause piazza to consider the alternative of being a designated hitter rather than playing first base when he did not catch but that piazza had never expressed such a sentiment piazza was tired the player said of continually having to respond to such reports mets officials last week responded to piazza 's public comments about playing first base with a shrug saying that he had made similar remarks to them they felt piazza was sincere in his willingness to try first and his only resentment was that he felt moving there was an idea forced upon him by members of the news media one mets player privately suggested earlier this season that jason phillips 's on the job transformation from catcher to first baseman proved that the transition is possible the player also said that the mets would benefit from having opposing teams not feel like they could run at will which often was the case when piazza was behind the plate the game itself seemed like a footnote on a strange afternoon phillips 's 14 game hitting streak the longest by a met since edgardo alfonzo hit in 15 straight games in 2001 ended yesterday phillips went 0 for 4 steve trachsel allowed two of the reds three home runs and cliff floyd was hit above his right elbow for the second time in a week
