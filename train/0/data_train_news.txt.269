 when the giants see the eagles they see green and white which of course also happens to be the color of money like instant cash the eagles have provided the giants an anchor for their season twice in each of the last four years it is now eight straight giants victories in this series and counting the latest a 24 7 mauling yesterday at giants stadium it is odd and perplexing in pro football when one team has a whammy on another tennessee enjoys that kind of hex over jacksonville kansas city used to do it to oakland just as san francisco used to cruelly batter the rams notice that those are all division matchups this latest giants eagles thing started when jim fassel became the giants coach in 1997 before that the eagles had won four straight in the series back in the late 1970 's the eagles won 11 straight but for the current bunch of eagles that irrelevant all they know is that they look like ants to the giants elephants they opened our eyes eagles receiver torrance small said we came in here 5 3 and feeling good about ourselves they made us realize that if we are going to have the kind of season we want we have to have the right attitude cornerback troy vincent said right now you have to give it to them they have our number we would love to play them a third time this season how many teams can beat you three times in a season the way things are going in this series the giants could beat the eagles 10 times this season and hardly break a sweat their defense was making plays eagles cornerback bobby taylor said and our defense was having trouble stopping their offense so i guess their offense was making plays too there are a lot of similarities up and down our division between teams owning other teams that is the nfc east it 's been that way for a while and it is not going to change in this series though we have to lick our wounds just like the giants bow down against washington they have lost four straight to the redskins the giants were 1 3 recently against dallas before beating them two sundays ago the eagles scored 41 points at dallas this year they lost by only 17 14 to washington and the giants lost to washington by 10 points earlier this season the eagles are bold and confident against dallas and washington the giants are not against the same teams but eagles giants the eagles keep looking spooked the ebb and flow of divisional series affect every team 's season and destiny if each team plays 16 games and half are in its division that is where the mark as a team must be carved fassel clearly understands this his giants teams have produced 7 0 1 5 3 and 3 5 divisional records his current team is 4 1 in the division that helps make the giants contenders in their division and beyond i do n't know we respect them a lot giants guard ron stone said when asked to explain the streak one of the things we do against them is we keep establishing the run we may not get a lot early but by the end of the game it piles up and tires them out that team is talented and young up and coming is the way giants cornerback andre weathers described the eagles you knew after the way we beat them the first time they would come gunpowder ready weathers said we knew we had to bring our a game in big games it 's all about what team will show up at that particular time and the giants repeatedly have no problem showing their best against the eagles the giants ran the ball 44 times they gained 25 first downs over all the eagles only 8 the giants held the ball for nearly three quarters sometimes when you walk out on that field you just know it that you are going to beat your man today and that you are going to win giants running back greg comella said that is happening for us against philadelphia confidence is born out of demonstrated ability so how do the giants gain those traits against washington how do they make their 6 2 season become much more by playing every team in the manner that they play the eagles in our practices for washington and tennessee tackle lomas brown said about the giants two losses we were kind of tight a lot of times when a coach is getting pressure from upstairs it rolls right downstairs and the players are the first to know it but this week i saw guys practicing relaxed and with confidence guys worked hard had fun and were loose that is how the game of football is supposed to be played we can be pretty good when we 're not a tight team guys were flying around saying 'let 's keep them under our thumb and 'we know what they got so let 's hit them into submission yes big hits hurt speed kills big plays dominate but pro football is a mind game the winners know
