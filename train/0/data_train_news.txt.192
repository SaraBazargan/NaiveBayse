 to the editor in a prompt for the conscience april 28 county executive andrew j spano suggests that people without disabilities who park in handicapped spaces can be dissuaded from doing so by asking them in a friendly neighborly way to park some place else mr spano 's suggestion is hopelessly naive as someone with multiple sclerosis who must use a scooter i find that gentle dissuasion has no effect whatsoever on a person inconsiderate enough to hijack a handicapped space in the first place replies i have received at least those that are fit to print have ranged from mind your own business to shut up to go take a walk not only was the woman who said the latter words to me perfectly ambulatory while i was sitting in a scooter but she then loudly complained to a friend she has some nerve she does n't know my husband is an invalid her husband was not with her yet she still felt entitled to a handicapped space a perfect example of the permit abuse described in your article the problem does n't end with the selfish behavior of nondisabled drivers i am also routinely frustrated at having to park in absurdly narrow or snow filled handicapped spaces and where are the curb cuts i find a spot get out of my van and then have no way of getting onto the sidewalk the lack of adequate accessible spaces as well as considerate people has left me doubly handicapped beth weiler scarsdale
