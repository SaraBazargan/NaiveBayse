 miguel tejada of the oakland athletics left yankee stadium last night with a 167 batting average and a future so uncertain that he recently voiced concerns that he might be traded that notion is borderline preposterous at least as long as the a 's are in contention but tejada will be a free agent after this season and oakland is unlikely to re sign him tejada selected the american league 's most valuable player last season insisted last night that he was focused and wanted to return to oakland but he did not dismiss the idea of playing for the yankees right now i 'm not really thinking about going anywhere said tejada who went 1 for 4 last night right now i 'm just thinking about being here i just want to win and i do n't think about any place that i want to go i 'm happy to play with oakland but next year i 'm going to be a free agent if the yankees are interested in me i 'm going to listen to them the free agent market will be dazzling next winter with tejada montreal outfielder vladimir guerrero and chicago white sox pitcher bartolo colon and philadelphia phillies pitcher kevin millwood among the stars on the market the yankees always look into premium free agents and tejada is a long shot possibility despite his position tejada has never played anywhere but shortstop and he would have to switch to third to play for the yankees jason giambi his former oakland teammate suggested in spring training that tejada could do that with robin ventura a free agent and drew henson progressing so slowly the yankees will have an opening tejada was noncommittal when asked if he would consider changing positions i really love playing shortstop and right now i feel like i can still play shortstop he said let 's see after the year is over where i 've got my mind
