 somehow princeton always seems to win its close games in the ncaa men 's lacrosse tournament it won its four previous ncaa games including last year 's final by one goal of its 11 previous ncaa games decided by one goal it won them all today the tigers did it again in their quarterfinal game they let a five goal lead slip away as georgetown tied the score on walid hajj 's goal with 44 seconds left no problem ryan boyle of princeton fired in a shot from 5 yards with four seconds left and the tigers exhaled with a 14 13 victory in the first game of the doubleheader syracuse ran off five consecutive goals in seven minutes in the first quarter then held off duke 10 9 the victories put princeton 9 4 and syracuse 13 2 into the national semifinals at rutgers for georgetown 12 3 and duke 8 7 the season has ended two more quarterfinal games will be played sunday in baltimore with johns hopkins 11 1 against massachusetts 12 3 and virginia 10 3 facing cornell 11 3 saturday 's semifinals will send princeton against the johns hopkins massachusetts winner and syracuse against the virginia cornell winner the final is may 27 johns hopkins is seeded first syracuse second virginia third and princeton fourth a nasty overnight rain stopped in time for today 's games but the 47 degree temperature and winds of 23 miles an hour seemed more appropriate for polar bear swimming than lacrosse still 5561 hardy souls many of them high school or youth soccer players wearing appropriate jackets turned out at hofstra stadium as coach mike pressler of duke said people got their money 's worth princeton and georgetown seemed headed for overtime which would have been especially dangerous for the tigers because the hoyas had momentum even when princeton had possession and called a timeout with 13 seconds left in regulation overtime seemed assured princeton set up a play but as coach bill tierney said as usual what we planned did n't work so the tigers tried another way to pick off a defender to free a shooter it worked dan clark set a pick for boyle but another defender picked up boyle then owen daly set a pick and as boyle said when i felt the defender 's stick go over my head i knew i was going to get an open shot and i knew i had plenty of time the shot meant no overtime and ended a season in which georgetown 's only losses came to massachusetts by three goals syracuse by one and princeton by one when the game was over the georgetown players stood frozen on the field in frustration midfielder steve dusseau georgetown 's best player said as a senior it 's tough to lose your last game by one goal dusseau was held to one goal and one assist but he will have other opportunities he has been chosen for the united states team for the world championships in july and he is graduating with a degree in psychology for years syracuse and princeton have made their marks in this sport syracuse has reached the final four for the 20th consecutive year and as coach john desko said if you can do anything 20 times in a row you 're doing ok princeton has won 6 of the last 10 national titles and eight straight ivy league championships syracuse seemed thankful to have survived a duke team that had the advantage on face offs 20 of 23 shots on goal 23 to 19 and ground balls 47 to 20 unlike georgetown syracuse escaped a last minute onslaught with 1 minute 29 seconds left syracuse was penalized and duke 's pressler gave his team a play we wanted a pick play for kevin cassese pressler said we went to our best guy and it did n't work out with 44 seconds left cassese got off a shot solid but wide twenty seconds later with the penalty over dan chemotti tried to shoot but john glatzel of syracuse tipped the ball off chemotti 's stick pressler spoke with pride for his underrated atlantic coast conference champions saying we stood toe to toe with the team i consider the best in the game today
