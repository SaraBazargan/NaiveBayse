 to the editor re playing ambulance roulette dec 3 the writers argued that patients having heart attacks should be directly routed by ems to centers that perform urgent angioplasty we feel their conclusions may be misguided establishing that a patient is having a heart attack is not as simple as recognizing burn or trauma victims fewer than 10 percent of patients with chest pain are in fact having heart attacks of patients with heart attacks fewer than 30 percent are eligible for urgent angioplasty thus taking all patients with suspected heart attacks to angioplasty hospitals would not only affect the city 's ems structure but would also require an enormous shift in hospital resources encouraging patients to seek care earlier will do far more to reduce heart attack mortality than rerouting city ambulances to specific hospitals dr jeptha p curtis yale school of medicine new haven
