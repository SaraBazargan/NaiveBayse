 another labor day has passed with the usual cookouts marches and store sales but characteristically little notice of what may be the fastest growing part of the work force those who labor off the books by its nature of course the underground economy is hard to measure but it 's not hard to see lately it has been all around us which is especially noteworthy now that the unemployment rate seems stuck at more than 6 percent some people have suggested that the unemployment figure is deceptively low there are after all more than two million people in prison many more than in decades past and disability claims are up too if all these potential workers were counted the unemployment rate would indeed be higher but the number of such potential workers is far exceeded by the total of those working off the books whose labors would drive down the unemployment rate significantly if counted that is especially true by historical standards because the amount of underground economic activity has been expanding so much the international monetary fund in a global survey of underground economic activity last year found that this sector has been growing in the united states for 30 years the authors of the imf report have estimated underground economic activity at 86 percent of gross domestic product in the united states up from 67 percent in 1990 and just 4 percent in 1970 because most people who work off the books are in labor intensive fields investment bankers and heart surgeons tend to operate within the confines of the tax system it is a safe bet that 9 percent of gdp translates to more than 9 percent of the work force no one is sure how many people work off the books but most of us do n't need the imf to tell us that the total is significant if you have children for instance you may be paying somebody off the books to care for them perhaps full time edgar l feige a retired economist at the university of wisconsin who is an authority on the underground economy has estimated from currency data that unreported income in the united states more than doubled during the 1990 's reaching 125 trillion in 2000 one reason for this growth is the arrival of millions of immigrants especially illegal ones there were an estimated 87 million illegal immigrants in this country in 2000 according to the census bureau and a large proportion are working off the books for employers who appreciate cheap compliant labor free of employment regulations and payroll taxes another reason is the growing importance of the service economy it is easier to keep this activity off the books in the case of child care for instance parents do not want to wrestle with paperwork and payroll taxes while the child care providers often prefer to avoid taxes in effect parents get cheaper labor while workers get higher wages changes in society over the decades have also encouraged off the books work women 's participation in the labor force exceeded 60 percent in 2001 up from 34 percent in 1950 that change has created much more demand for child care gardening and other domestic help while a large underground economy suggests a lot of tax evasion it also implies something positive that inflation is even lower than the official rate and of course it means that an awful lot of employment is not captured by government statistics so i 'm doubtful that unemployment was a big problem this labor day especially given the odds that someone out of work might be living with someone else who still has a job and thus can put food on the table that the united states economy has produced enough jobs for millions of women and immigrants over the years without unemployment soaring far beyond 6 percent is close to miraculous the real problem is what has happened to the least skilled and least paid workers from 1979 to 2001 according to the bureau of labor statistics the real earnings of men without high school diplomas fell by a horrifying 28 percent for women whose pay was already lower the decline was still 9 percent here too immigration and off the books labor have played roles by sharply increasing the pool of low skill labor a lot has changed since labor days past but we still have n't managed to repeal the law of supply and demand on the contrary daniel akst 's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first sunday of each month e mail culmoney nytimescom
