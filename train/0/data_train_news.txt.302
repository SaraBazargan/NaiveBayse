 chris byrd does not annihilate opponents as much as he annoys them evander holyfield was just the latest victim saturday night byrd became the new international boxing federation heavyweight champion with a 12 round unanimous decision over holyfield at boardwalk hall there were no knockdowns and neither fighter was seriously hurt but that was typical of a byrd fight he pecks away with his jab he uses his speed and elusiveness to avoid trouble and he is rarely baited into toe to toe exchanges boxing to his strengths and exposing his opponent 's weaknesses is the formula that byrd 36 2 has used to take his place among the sport 's top heavyweights and at 32 he plans to be around awhile it 's time for me to move on to try to beat the best guys out there said byrd who added that he would love to fight either lennox lewis the world boxing council champion or the winner of the world boxing association championship bout in march between roy jones jr and john ruiz but in the wild world of boxing it remains to be seen whether byrd receives a crack at lewis ruiz or jones lewis watched saturday 's fight from ringside and he remained noncommittal about his next opponent byrd 's lack of punching power for a heavyweight could be a huge disadvantage against a boxer of lewis 's size while lewis regularly fights at 240 pounds or more byrd entered the ring at about 210 on saturday and his two losses have come against bigger fighters ike ibeabuchi and wladimir klitschko though his opinion is hardly unbiased emanuel steward lewis 's trainer said lewis 's power would overwhelm byrd we wo n't even use a sparring partner that 's under 220 pounds stewart said they 've got to come up with some new weight divisions chris is very good with these smaller guys but when it gets to guys like lennox who are 260 pounds and who can punch he 's not going to hold up and it 's not fair to him i wish they would have a division with a 220 pound limit if i were a boxing commissioner that 's the first thing i would do on saturday night skill was more important than size and byrd displayed plenty of boxing skill facing a fighter who was about his size byrd frustrated holyfield 38 6 2 particularly during the later rounds when holyfield 's 40 year old legs appeared to be weary holyfield said he injured his left shoulder in the first round and there was no reason to doubt him because he threw few jabs but even if holyfield had been 100 percent the outcome might not have been much different according to the judges the fight was not close steve weisfeld and eugene grant scored it 117 111 and john stewart had it 116 112 all in favor of byrd while holyfield seemed to land the heavier punches byrd threw more shots displayed more hand speed and scored enough clean punches to sway the judges as the fight progressed byrd 's confidence grew several times after slipping punches byrd stuck out his tongue at holyfield byrd was particularly impressive in rounds 6 through 9 hitting holyfield with punches that did not hurt but that dissuaded holyfield from mounting an attack byrd insists he can beat any heavyweight and saturday 's victory will make it more difficult for top contenders to ignore him he entered the ring facing a fighter with a bigger name and more experience but he left the ring holding a championship belt it feels good after a lot of years of hard work he said i 'm looking forward to some more big fights
