 is there a new york kid of 50 who hears the name topps and does not wistfully recall a baseball card of mickey mantle or roger maris packed with a slice of gum a whippersnapper who went on to a career in law might also be aware of two decades of suits against the company for restraint of trade for years thanks to exclusive contracts with the players topps had a lock on baseball cards off anyway to the topps company offices we go to meet arthur t shorin 65 a second generation baseball card man now the company chief executive he is a friendly unpretentious man who comes to fetch his visitors from the reception area himself it is somewhat disconcerting entering his office to learn that what mr shorin desires in the height of world series fever is to show off his company 's other products specifically a line of lollipops called push pops one of which is disguised to look like a writing instrument see you take it to school put it in your pocket it looks like a pen mr shorin says then when the teacher turns away here he whips it out of his pocket and makes a happy slurp slurp noise we also have push pop jumbo and push pop triple power three different flavors three different colors though topps is known for sports cards it 's also in the candy business and the candy business is bigger than the sports business it is also disappointing hoping for a peek at a collection of vintage cards to learn that the only baseball card mr shorin owns is one in a limited edition he made for president george bush but perhaps the gloomiest moment comes in discussion of the change in baseball cards one has heard that topps baseball cards no longer come with gum you betcha says mr shorin cheerfully that stopped eight years ago when collectors said gum stained the cards that would be grownup collectors sure they represent 70 percent of the market so they rule mr shorin says he capitulated yes i capitulated that 's called marketing oh what has become of the topps company of youth which operated out of a little factory in brooklyn and manufactured bazooka bubble gum gone with your 32 inch waist fella and any illusions you had left that joe dimaggio was a prince topps today is a publicly held company with headquarters in lower manhattan and sales of 286 million for the first six months of this year of that 64 million came from the sales of pokemon products a smart acquisition that last for industry wide sales of sports cards according to sports collectors digest have fallen 67 percent since the 1991 boom mr shorin has nothing against baseball he 'd like to see series games played a little earlier so kids might get a chance to see them but you want to hear awe and respect in his voice listen to the way he talks about men who can sell his father and three uncles for instance who created the topps company in 1938 those guys were smart the major gum manufacturers could not get enough sugar to run their factories during world war ii so the shorin brothers bought up small candy companies took their sugar quotas and were able to produce looking for a way to lift sales after the war the brothers add baseball cards to their gum in 1951 they ensure success by signing up promising young players to long term exclusive contracts and defended that exclusivity for 30 years arthur shorin who grows up in the crown heights section of brooklyn does not plan a career in business he dreams of being a broadway composer and is still more excited recalling the two hours he spent with oscar hammerstein ii playing him his songs than talking baseball he had some success steve lawrence of steve and eydie recorded a few of his songs even so at 21 he joined topps why truth be known i loved business i genuinely loved it his new venture will be selling cards on ebay in a process called an initial player offering best to let mr shorin explain you say 'i want to take a position in timo perez i think he 's got a great future i think the value of the card is gon na go up you put in to buy 25 cards you are notified of an ipo an initial player offering coming public we might get an order for 35000 cards we 're only selling 6000 cards so you will be informed that you got 8 cards your credit card is charged those cards appear on your portfolio increasingly excited he says his company can store the cards for you the buyer has the comfort of knowing the quality of that card that it has not left the vault one envisions cards unsmeared by sweat chocolate pocket gunk a vision as heartening as a baseball stadium clean of soda cups and hand scrawled signs after the game which is to say a game without heart how old does a person have to be to bid on an initial player offering you have to have a credit card though there will be a provision later for people to set up a portfolio for your kid grandma will be able to give a gift that 's awful mr shorin is told i can tell you the research we 've done shows they love it the word research in a discussion about baseball that 's it the game is over until spring
