 to the editor regarding the article last sunday about the dobbs ferry village government 's barring nonresidents from parking at its metro north station commuter parking is a problem not only in ardsley and dobbs ferry but in most of westchester county i believe that this parking problem highlights the need for governments to require developers to submit transportation impact statements when proposing to build condominiums co ops or other housing the transportation impact statement should include provisions for shuttle bus or van service from the housing complex to a train or bus station if every new complex would offer residents transportation to a train or bus station we could avoid creating additional traffic congestion and metro north parking problems paul feiner town supervisor greenburgh
