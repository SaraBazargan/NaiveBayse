 the yankees were gagging this weekend gasping for air in a season that they keep treating too cavalierly they are up then they fall down they are in then they are stumbling out the yankees have performed like the sybil of baseball teams lately one personality expecting something good to happen and the other expecting something bad to happen october is no time to be so unpredictable teams can not blink in the three of five game division series or they can suddenly be sitting next to the atlanta braves ordering mozzarella sticks with those chicken fingers as the postseason unfolds on television before their disappointed eyes the yankees should realize that maybe the yankees finally do after stopping the athletics 7 5 last night to win a tense division series in five games the yankees gave andy pettitte a 6 0 bulge before he lifted his right leg and began his pitching motion for the first time but they still added unnecessary drama the a 's would not go to sleep quietly or more accurately pettitte could not silence them when your most successful starting pitcher has a six run lead in the first inning against a team he has beaten three times this season it is supposed to be a calm night chill the champagne wrap the plastic around the lockers and take ticket orders for the american league championship series it should have been that simple for the yankees nothing has come easily for us this year said bernie williams after a subdued celebration nothing the yankees have been a wayward team for the last month tip toeing along like a toddler along a beach not sure if he wants to get his feet wet the toddler walks along the edge and waits but sometimes he is not ready and he gets splashed the yankees have looked like that toddler obviously this sloppy approach can not continue if the yankees expect to win their third straight world series title manager joe torre has such scant confidence in his middle relievers that he used mike stanton normally a setup man in the fourth inning jeff nelson another setup man in the sixth and orlando hernandez a starter who won game 3 for one out in the eighth mariano rivera notched the last five outs and saved all three victories arriving in the eighth inning each time in the five years that i 've been here this is the toughest series we played derek jeter said we battled they battled this is a relief there is no timo perez on the yankees but their heroes last night were unusual chuck knoblauch who spent more time talking to friends than fielding grounders before game 4 on saturday returned to the lineup and poked two singles during a six run first after being benched in game 2 knoblauch said i guess i might not play in the postseason again but knoblauch did and the yankees needed him and the bullpen saved the season by following pettitte and retiring 16 of the last 19 batters who said we 're too old stanton shouted we 're just old enough pettitte stopped the a 's 4 0 in the second game of the series and was 2 0 with a 106 earned run average against them during the regular season someone wondered if the a 's would feel more comfortable because they had opposed pettitte four days ago we used to face koufax a lot torre countered it did n't do us a bit of good but even koufax lost pettitte was uncomfortable as the a 's scored two two out runs in the second inning one run in the third and two more in a dangerous fourth when the yankees tumbled to the indians in game 5 in 1997 the last time they faced elimination pettitte let omar vizquel rattle him at the plate and on the bases and it helped lead to a crushing 4 0 deficit tonight the a 's trimmed the deficit to 7 5 and if one of their two sacrifice flies had soared into a gap in the fourth pettitte might have fizzled again every time i started to lose perspective i looked at the scoreboard and we were still ahead torre said as the yankees took batting practice yesterday at the network associates coliseum they were a little bleary eyed because they had landed in san francisco about 6 30 am eastern time for a game they had desperately wanted to avoid but the yankees definitely awakened when an interview with oakland 's eric chavez was shown on the right field scoreboard chavez was asked about ending the yankees successful run i do n't mind at all chavez said i mean they 've won enough times it 's time for some other people to have some glory here but no they had a great run had that chavez spoke in the past tense irritated several yankees i think it 's fitting that the last out was from the guy who insinuated that we were over the hill williams said it 's my understanding that we 're not done yet after the 1997 loss george steinbrenner circled the clubhouse and bellowed we 'll win it next year mark it down they did would george dare say that the erratic yankees will threepeat this season the yankees could because they can handle the mariners and they should not fear the mets or the cardinals the sybil of baseball teams has to find a winning personality and maintain it after all it is october teams must make good things happen
