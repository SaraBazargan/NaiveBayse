 it is called minor league but the manager quotes casey stengel from memory it is called minor league but the manager behaves like gil hodges from memory it is called minor league but most of the seats are sculptured and there are gift shops and luxury boxes for goodness sake in truth bud harrelson has more in common with joan payson than his early managers the rather jolly first owner of the mets never put on a uniform and tried to manage but here is bud harrelson a major investor in a new team called the long island ducks hitting fungoes and coaching third base and recruiting players and even giving calm hodges like counsel to an umpire harrelson has put up his own money to be part of either a fad or a resurgence of minor league baseball he is not only wearing his old no 3 but he is also the president of the independent atlantic league with eight teams including the ducks who are based in central islip ny exactly 42 miles from my house notes harrelson who considers himself a homebody he does n't see himself riding the bus from aberdeen md to lehigh valley pa to newark and somerset and atlantic city in new jersey to bridgeport conn to nashua nh for long but for now bud harrelson is the most visible big league icon in this young league he played in two world series grappled in the dust with pete rose waved runners around third on that manic mookie night in 1986 went slightly mad managing the mets but now is a patient 56 year old builder of ball teams what else do i know harrelson said the other night i wanted something i could get involved in i did n't care for restaurants things like that i know this this venture goes beyond building malls or multiplexes or theme restaurants although it surely aims for those same discretionary dollars minor league baseball does not exist in a vacuum but rather for its mystical links to the major leagues that 35 year old playing first base for the ducks doug jennings got a hit in the 1990 world series for oakland that chap sitting by the newark dugout the very hands on owner of the bears rick cerone once told off his owner a chap named steinbrenner that youngster smacking the ball for the bears bobby hill an all american out of the university of miami is only waiting for the major league draft in june catch him now for single digit dollars right in downtown newark where the old newark bears once produced future yankees the purpose of this league is to make money draw fans win games propel players toward the majors teach the game entertain all at the same time harrelson regards baseball as something worth passing on the way others passed it on to him there was charles dillon stengel waiting impatiently for the youth of america one early spring the hapless mets brought in a scrawny shortstop and suggested he try switch hitting why would n't ya wan na as the old man used to say in socratic fashion i was out in the back cage one morning all by myself just taking my cuts harrelson recalled the other night suddenly i heard this voice 'hey he put me in the starting lineup that day led off against bob gibson batting lefty i bunted one down the third base line for a hit casey turned him over to solomon hemus a savvy coach and roy mcmillan a grizzled shortstop until the kid was ready now harrelson aims for the same instincts casey had the other night in newark he sent his 35 year old player coach bert heffernan a catcher who went 1 for 11 for seattle in 1992 out to play left field to get some swings heffernan who had sought out the ducks so he could stay home on long island had two hits and drove in two runs harrelson was almost as thrilled as heffernan then there was a touch of hodges one of the greatest players managers and human beings not yet in the baseball hall of fame the other night a pitch hit a ducks batter on the foot and ricocheted to the catcher just about everybody saw it that way but the umpire harrelson strolled out methodically the way hodges had done in the 1969 world series when he produced the ball a ball with a smudge that looked like shoe polish insisting that very ball had hit cleon jones on the shoe i said 'it hit the batter first harrelson said the other night the umpire said 'oh i did n't see it rather amazingly the ump waved the batter to first did it help that harrelson is also president of the league who knows tom o'malley the bears manager who had a career in north america and japan knew he was whipped just as earl weaver had known back in 1969 gil never argued harrelson said later he just talked the hip fans know they are watching a glorious history the youngsters know they can get close to ball players who sign autographs and can play a little our prices are cheaper too said the manager who has a piece of the action
