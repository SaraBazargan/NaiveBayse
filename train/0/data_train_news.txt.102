 jason kidd wore so much ice around his right shoulder that he looked the part of a starting pitcher who had just finished a complete game and he still could not pick up the victory the nets did not sustain any significant injuries against the detroit pistons on sunday night but they received some serious scares kidd took a huge blow to his right shoulder after faking a shot and kerry kittles banged his right hip chasing a rebound in a sense the nets were fortunate to leave the palace with only a 98 84 loss already missing four regulars the nets ran out of bodies again they temporarily lost two of their best frontline players alonzo mourning and aaron williams when they picked up their fifth fouls in a span of 14 seconds in the third quarter nets coach byron scott had to call on tamar slay who had picked up four fouls in the four minutes he played in the second quarter at the time of slay 's arrival the score was tied at 68 68 from that point the pistons never trailed again outscoring the nets 30 16 mourning was particularly upset by some of the calls detroit made more free throws 25 of 33 than the nets attempted 18 of 24 i do n't expect the refs to be perfect but some games you live with them and die with them mourning said the nets did n't help themselves with their interior defense they repeatedly allowed the pistons to catch the ball near the basket and richard hamilton and corliss williamson combined to shoot 18 for 28 and score 44 points before this season the nets had not been under 500 since trading for kidd in 2001 they have now fallen under that mark twice in the past four days and will take a 3 4 record into wednesday 's game with san antonio a rematch of the nba finals we do n't feel sorry for ourselves said richard jefferson who scored 13 points for the nets but also had five fouls no one 's feeling sorry for us you do n't want to give teams like indiana and detroit confidence but they understand we 're down and this is a good time to get us the nets seem to agree that auburn hills is their least favorite stop in the eastern conference and not just because of the dearth of night life they have now dropped 17 of 18 regular season games at the palace i think we match up really well with them mourning said we 're short handed and look how we still played mourning was the first one off his seat when kidd fell hard in front of the nets bench with 10 minutes 6 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter ben wallace the pistons 6 foot 9 240 pound power forward not only bought kidd 's pump fake he also landed on kidd 's right shoulder when you try to get a big guy off his feet you pay the price said kidd who made two free throws after wallace fouled him and i did still kidd stayed in the game and played a season high 45 minutes finishing with 18 points and 11 assists scott has wanted to get kidd some rest but he is playing more than ever kittles who scored 17 points will have a hard time just putting up his feet having recently healed from a bruised thigh he collided with bob sura in the fourth quarter and followed kidd to the bench to ice his right hip kittles and kidd said they would not miss any time but it is early in the season to be playing through so many ailments in this league nagging injuries are always the worst kittles said the nets do n't have enough depth to compensate they led by 13 points in the first quarter but slay and brandon armstrong were ineffective going a combined 2 of 10 with 4 turnovers the backup point guard zoran planinic could not fill in for kidd for more than three minutes planinic a rookie from croatia talks regularly on the phone with darko milicic whom the pistons selected with the second overall pick in the draft milicic from serbia and montenegro did not leave the bench sunday they are both having trouble learning english which is essential for planinic because he shouts plays as a point guard he called and said 'i have problems with that milicic said for him it 's really hard with the language
