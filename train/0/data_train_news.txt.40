 for 11 consecutive years bob huggins has taken cincinnati to the ncaa tournament it is a rite of spring in american sport the bearcats arrive every march with a wealth of talent and a gaudy dazzling record this year for the first time cincinnati was also awarded a no 1 seeding and then on thursday for the eighth successive year cincinnati won its first tournament game on the eve of today 's game with ucla with a wide uncharacteristic grin huggins said jokingly that the top seeding and maybe st patrick 's day would bring his team luck but not every spring custom involving cincinnati and the ncaa tournament delivers a smile to huggins 's face most times in fact march ultimately leaves him grumpy today for the fifth time in six years huggins 's bearcats were eliminated from the ncaa tournament in the second round squandering an 11 point second half lead cincinnati became the first top seeded team of the 2002 tournament to lose as the bearcats fell in double overtime to ucla 105 101 at mellon arena although once again one of the most gifted teams with an all american senior guard in steve logan who led the bearcats beyond modest preseason predictions cincinnati will nonetheless be going home far earlier than expected i just wish we could get a bounce or a break in this tournament something to go our way huggins said there will be other interpretations of how and why cincinnati 31 4 lost ucla for example played with more passion and energy in the game 's closing stages the bruins were deeper had fresher legs got brilliant performances from their stars when cincinnati did not and dominated the tall cincinnati front line late in the game while cincinnati had the experience in the backcourt it was ucla 's two freshman point guards cedric bozeman and ryan walcott who played the entire 50 minutes without a turnover ucla 21 11 came into the tournament with losses in four of its previous six games but its recent tournament experience is the reverse of cincinnati 's ucla is one of three colleges duke and kentucky are the others that has advanced to the round of 16 in four of the last five seasons ucla coach steve lavin is 5 0 in second round games during his six seasons with the team we 've had a strange up and down year said lavin whose team will play 12th seeded missouri in the west regional semifinals on thursday in san jose calif we 've been trying to blend senior veteran players and these skilled and talented freshman it 's been tough sometimes but i think the mix of older and younger may be finally paying off cincinnati 's leonard stokes had 39 points in large part because ucla was focusing its defense on logan but ultimately stokes tired and his shots stopped falling late in the game when it was logan 's turn to resurrect cincinnati he had no answers logan missed two open shots near the end of regulation and made only one a meaningless 3 pointer in the final moments in the overtime periods he finished with 18 points but was 6 for 18 from the floor as cincinnati was sagging ucla was surging although cincinnati appeared to have the game in control with a 65 54 lead with 9 minutes 25 seconds to play in regulation ucla 's matt barnes helped the bruins charge back into the game with back to back 3 point shots that cut the bearcats lead to 65 60 the lead remained 5 points until a put back by barnes and a 3 point shot by jason kapono tied the score 71 71 ucla appeared the stronger more confident team thereafter especially under the basket while cincinnati had controlled the boards with 13 offensive rebounds that led to 17 second chance points in the first half ucla adjusted in the second half playing a more traditional zone defense and worrying less about logan ucla outrebounded cincinnati and had 13 second chance points to cincinnati 's 5 as the game wore on ucla 's offense was growing more versatile as cincinnati 's was growing more one dimensional cincinnati rarely worked the ball inside in the game 's final minutes or in overtime for ucla barnes continued to sparkle as a scorer and playmaker and center dan gadzuric had 13 rebounds to go along with his 26 points both teams had chances to win the game at the end of the second half but neither made its final shots it was much the same at the end of the first overtime in the second overtime logan and stokes who each played 46 minutes appeared fatigued as did most of the cincinnati team ucla quickly grabbed a 4 point lead that it extended to 6 in the final minute cincinnati had nothing left for a last charge huggins conceded that his team was probably tired by the second overtime but he focused his lament on the missed opportunities at the end of regulation and on a missed shot by immanuel mcelroy at the end of the first overtime we also had a tip in attempt off that missed shot that could have won the game he said huggins also called ucla the most talented eighth seed in the history of the ncaa tournament their power forward gets 17 points and 11 assists huggins said of barnes that has n't happened since magic johnson lavin said there were times in this season when you had to really wonder if something like this would come to us but these players have been resilient throughout that 's the lesson of the season and of today
