 todd zeile has heard the grumbling in dugouts around baseball the yankees get every call in yankee stadium the ball always bounces the yankees way and every time the yankees stock up on talent during the season you hear sarcastic shows of emotion zeile admitted zeile is quick to add that he never indulged in those sour grapes himself and now he has been rewarded with a tour of duty with the rich and talented and dominating and perpetual yankees he was in the lineup yesterday as the yankees beat toronto 4 0 to improve their record to 12 victories and 3 losses the yankees have not won a world series in two years now but they are the champions all the same they have now tied the best start in the history of the club just when the underclass of the north american baseball world thought the yankee domination could not possibly get worse this pitching staff looks like it could win oh let 's be conservative 120 or 130 games this season the scary part is that the yankees are not even getting much from about 50 million worth of their payroll what with derek jeter mariano rivera and steve karsay injured and sterling hitchcock and jose contreras hardly contributing for the yankees 50 million is a mere offering to placate the baseball gods the yankees are loaded in cable income and in the dugout jeter gets hurt erick almonte hits a home run in his first start the young shortstop does look a little shaky right now but the yanks can carry him a long way the outfield looks a little shaky hideki matsui comes along with professional skills and even a wry sense of humor some starters may not last forever jeff weaver threw 120 pitches yesterday to show that the near future may be very much like the recent past some people think none of this is fair even some people in opposing dugouts think it is n't fair i always felt you were playing more than that particular team said zeile now with his 10th team making it sound as if billy martin were chasing windblown pop ups and elston howard were hitting one into the gap and so on and so on zeile and his fellow emigre robin ventura say they never resented the yankees domination when they were on the other side rather they respected the yankees for what they were and what they did you look at them ventura said yesterday on his day off they had a lot of players come up through the system jeter bernie mariano jorge they saw something in tino to replace mattingly and a lot of it has to do with joe full names are not necessary for this cast of characters now part of the ever expanding yankee legend ventura came along with the white sox while the yankees were down in the early 90 's by the time he got to the world series with the mets in 2000 the yankees were back to demoralizing everybody who came along we felt we could play with them ventura said recalling bobby valentine 's scrappy band way back when that hopeful state was dissipated in the first game the mets had a 3 2 lead with one out in the bottom of the ninth and armando benitez had a 1 2 count on paul o'neill who then obsessively fouled off four pitches we started to think 'we really need to get this guy out ventura recalled instead o'neill walked on the 10th pitch scored the tying run and the yankees won the world series in five games that one at bat by paul set a tone ventura recalled they have the end result it is a collection of doing things right the yankees new dynasty is not merely about money but about making the right choices the mets let ventura and zeile get away spent foolishly and are now looking like 1962 ineptitude at 2003 prices meanwhile ventura and now zeile have moved seamlessly into the yankee clubhouse just like dozens of other lifers when they won the bronx lottery for a season or two everybody wants to wear the uniform unless you 're a dyed in the wool red sox fan or something zeile said you feel you are fortunate to wear the uniform most teams just ca n't break the barrier zeile added there 's a mental edge the latest example came on this homestand now ended we were down 5 0 then it was 5 5 ventura said talking about wednesday 's game the yankees ultimately lost but yesterday they dominated it has happened before it seems to be happening again
