 northern illinois football fans have not had much reason to celebrate since their team gained major college status 34 seasons ago sure there was the california bowl victory in 1983 and there was a triumph over central michigan in 1998 but that brought joy to campus only because it snapped a 23 game losing streak september is early to be thinking about bowl games but northern illinois fans can not help themselves this season the huskies are on a different kind streak a winning streak over nationally ranked teams on aug 28 here northern illinois stunned maryland then ranked no 15 in overtime 20 13 last saturday in tuscaloosa ala the huskies pulled off another upset defeating alabama which was no 21 19 16 how monumental were these victories only two other times had the huskies knocked off a ranked opponent northern illinois a university surrounded by endless cornfields 55 miles west of chicago is now in the center of the national spotlight for the first time the huskies are nationally ranked at no 20 any time a team is ranked it 's exciting and it gives you instant credibility said coach joe novak whose team is 3 0 for the first time since 1988 i can walk in now to talk to recruits since we 're on tv a little bit and in the national rankings kids know who we are while northern illinois has had only 10 winning seasons since 1969 there were signs at the start of this season that it was on the doorstep of big time success in the relative obscurity of the mid american conference northern illinois had put together three consecutive winning seasons 6 5 6 5 and 8 4 and shared the conference 's west division title the past two seasons anyone who still scoffs at the mac should re examine last saturday 's results marshall upended no 6 kansas state and toledo downed no 9 pittsburgh the mac definitely opened eyes last weekend huskies quarterback josh haldi said i do n't think people gave us the respect we deserved in the past he added when northern illinois plays outside the mac it aims for the stratosphere last season it lost to wisconsin in madison by 3 points and two seasons ago it nearly beat illinois in champaign by the time they played at alabama the northern illinois juniors and seniors were used to mammoth marching bands and stadiums that dwarf their 30000 seat home it 's nothing new for us tailback michael turner said of playing traditional powerhouses once you do it once doing it again is like riding a bike northern illinois had another reason to enter this season with the slightest of swaggers turner was the top returning rusher and all purpose yardage gainer in division i which includes divisions i a and i aa he ran for 1915 yards and gained 2284 all purpose yards in 2002 as a junior turner like a majority of his teammates is from illinois and was recruited by only northern illinois but he torched alabama for 156 rushing yards behind a young line he is averaging 1267 yards a game this season eight years ago when novak left his position as indiana 's defensive coordinator to become the huskies coach words like rankings were not uttered in dekalb novak 58 turned the program around gradually by preaching he said all those corny things patience discipline and hard work he said he recruited players who bought into this philosophy and were willing to endure more losing before winning would arrive one player novak will not get to coach again is shea fitzgerald who was among 12 people killed when the porch of a chicago apartment building collapsed in june the death of fitzgerald an offensive lineman who showed tremendous potential as a sophomore last season was devastating but it pulled our team together that much more because we used each other to deal with it novak said before every game the huskies talk about fitzgerald and his memory serves as inspiration as they try to achieve their only goal this season our goal we have one and the kids picked this i did n't is to be mid american champions novak said are we national championship caliber i do n't know about that but i sure know that we can get in the mix with some people you will not catch maryland and alabama disagreeing
