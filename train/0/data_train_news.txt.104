 scouts and coaches this week began dissecting an overflow of paperwork interviews and videotape on more than 320 college players it is their time to focus on last weekend 's combine in indianapolis now is the time when draft day decisions are in part being made this is a stretch for teams to check their homework and then check it again to begin developing their consensus for the april 15 draft and yet even after the five day combine that ended this past monday more testing is required following a trend several of the projected first round players at the combine refused to perform drills especially the 40 yard sprint most of the upper tier players enjoy that luxury want to see me run come to my campus at a later date when i am ready miami tight end bubba franks for example told the scouts and coaches that he will run for them today on the miami campus some guys who do n't want to run at the combine are injured and want to heal to run a better time said jon kingdon the raiders director of player personnel others the agents tell them do n't do it it may be 40 yards in distance any where you run it but at the combine it is a little different the guys are up early some have had their physicals the day they run it 's winter and even though you 're indoors it 's just not as ideal for some but the other side is if you can run you can run and if you can really run the scout will come to see even at your place nearly all of those expected to be drafted did arrive for the combine if only to be interviewed by the teams several players did perform and three of them really ran teams were mesmerized by the blinding speed of melvin harris a virginia cornerback he ran a 434 in the 40 yard sprint a 45 is good a 44 is wonderful a 434 is wondrous close behind were r jay soward of southern california and chris cole of texas am who ran 435 and 437 respectively soward was unusual because while he ran he was counting yelling the numbers out loud said gil brandt a draft analyst he was extremely boisterous something we had never seen before we asked him why and he told us that if he can count while running the 40 and not get to the number 19 that he knows he ran under 44 seconds now that was a twist brandt added speed is important in football and it is the skill that every team craves this draft is good at wide receiver offensive line and running back all drafts are basically the same in terms of the number of people that are going to make it but this one is different in that the first five or six drafted are pro bowl caliber players and then after that there are a lot of good players especially in the second round or from picks 7 to 50 you are going to find a contributing football player the first four players expected to be drafted include receiver peter warrick from florida state offensive tackle chris samuels from alabama and linebacker lavar arrington and defensive end courtney brown from penn state after the first four picks up and down the first round it 's wide open kingdon said the school most represented at the combine was texas am it had 10 players present florida state and virginia tech each produced 8 arkansas had 7 marshall had 5 consider that texas el paso and jackson state each featured 3 players but notre dame only 2 the tight ends were impressive three franks anthony becht from west virginia and erron kinney from florida averaged 6 feet 5 inches and 270 pounds five fullbacks weighed in at 250 pounds or more ten years ago those numbers would have been the size of offensive linemen brandt said scouts were shocked at the strength of leif larson a defensive end from texas el paso it is special if a player can bench press 225 pounds 20 times larson did it 45 times the most ever at the combine afterward though he was upset he said he had been routinely benching it 50 times in his preparation sebastian janikowski from florida state showed up in an area that is as difficult at the combine as any place kicking kingdon said you 're working with new snappers new holders but this guy did n't miss a beat he made 3 of 3 from 50 yards the ball exploded off of his foot but teams may be hesitant to draft janikowski because the polish born kicker was accused of bribing a police officer and may face deportation the star of this combine however was safety brian urlacher of new mexico he may indeed play safety in the pros but several scouts said they expect him to be moved to linebacker we list him as 6 37 8 258 pounds brandt said he ran a 46 and at that size that is remarkable he did 27 reps on the bar in my estimation he is going to be a top 10 pick he did everything at the combine and so he will probably be the only player in the top 10 who went there and showed his all urlacher weighed 253 pounds at the senior bowl a few weeks earlier but had added 5 pounds by the combine at new mexico he was a mammoth safety worked as the gunner on the punt coverage team played on other return teams and on offense caught seven passes six for touchdowns he told scouts and coaches at the combine that he has lived for draft day all of his life he 's really good kingdon said he 's flying up there as teams sift through their charts with the draft more than a month away with so many private workouts coming there is still time for others to fly and time too for others to slip and fall
