 steve fossett the 58 year old chicago investment executive whose six year quest to circumnavigate the world in a balloon ended five times in frustration succeeded yesterday on his sixth attempt he became the first person to fly around the planet nonstop and alone without a motor floating 27000 feet over the indian ocean near the southwestern tip of australia mr fossett crossed his starting longitude of 117 degrees east at 9 38 pm local time 9 38 am eastern time after 13 1 2 days in the air mr fossett and his balloon the spirit of freedom had taken off on june 18 from the town of northam directly to the north in far western australia his journey covered more than 19400 miles all in the southern hemisphere it 's enormous relief and satisfaction mr fossett said via a satellite phone to a news conference at his control center in st louis mr fossett said he had a few bottles of beer with him but i 'll be saving that for the landing because there 's no one to drink it with here after crossing the finish line mr fossett steered his balloon toward winds that would carry him to the northeast he is expected to land in southern australia at dusk today mr fossett 's balloon flight is the second to circumnavigate the globe but the first to be accomplished solo a flight in march 1999 with dr bertrand piccard of switzerland and brian jones of england as the pilots was the first around the world balloon trip landing in egypt after flying for 19 days and more than 29000 miles over china the pacific ocean and the united states mr fossett 's trip was shorter in distance and duration but still qualified as circling the world according to the rules set by the international aeronautic federation in switzerland to meet the federation 's definition mr fossett had to fly at least 12400 miles and to remain outside an imaginary circle 4143 miles in diameter drawn around the south pole circling the earth at the equator is a distance of 24900 miles based on the information we have so far we believe he will be able to successfully claim some records said thierry montigneaux the federation 's assistant secretary general mr fossett 's trip was much more arduous than dr piccard 's and mr jones 's who were able to switch off piloting duties so that each could sleep part of the time during his flight mr fossett slept only about four hours a day usually naps of 45 minutes or less when he allowed the balloon to be guided by autopilot the traveling accommodations aboard the spirit of freedom were much more spartan lacking for instance air his capsule 7 feet long 5 feet wide and 5 feet tall was unpressurized requiring him to wear an oxygen mask during almost all of the trip he also had to climb outside into subzero temperatures to change fuel tanks and repair burners mr fossett who swam the english channel in 1985 and raced an iditarod dog sled in 1992 took on the challenges of ballooning in the mid 1990 's several of his earlier attempts which began in 1996 ended in near disaster in 1998 a thunderstorm sucked him down ruptured the balloon and slammed him into the south pacific he swam out of the gondola on fire and already under water and was rescued a few hours later experience from his earlier flights improvements in the balloon design and more accurate weather forecasting helped limit problems during this flight and also a bit of luck said david perlman a shift supervisor at mission control we 're still waiting for him to land that 's why we have n't really begun our celebrations yet on june 23 off chile mr fossett lowered the balloon to just 900 feet above the pacific ocean to slow down and avoid the path of a storm ahead a sudden rain squall knocked him down 500 more feet or just 400 feet above the water that was probably the most dangerous situation of the trip mr perlman said he was going to go fishing but he decided not to when a valve on the burner became stuck open he used the chemical heating pack from one of his militarylike food packs to defrost it mr perlman said but for most of the flight the weather was in his favor over south africa the jet stream winds whisked him along at 200 miles an hour alan noble project director for cameron balloons of bristol england which built the spirit of freedom as well as mr fossett 's earlier balloons said he carried his cellphone in case he needed to be consulted on any mechanical problems this time it did n't ring once he said i think it 's a good indication of how everything went like other long distance balloons the billowing envelope of the 180 foot high spirit of freedom consists of two compartments one containing 550000 cubic feet of helium which provided most of the lift and one containing 100000 cubic feet of air one of the design improvements was better insulation between the two layers of material the battle we have is preventing the sun from heating the balloon during the day and the reverse battle at night mr noble said for his next feat mr fossett said during the news conference he would like to fly a glider to the stratosphere 60000 feet above the ground
