 the national football league is pondering meeting with two lawyers who seek increases in head coaching opportunities for african americans the nfl received a letter from the lawyers late thursday night the letter was addressed to the commissioner but he was out of town a league official requesting anonymity said it is being reviewed we will respond sometime next week and it is possible that if the commissioner does not meet with them he will appoint someone in the league office to do so it could be the first step to avoid litigation on a sensitive and explosive issue for african american coaches the league 's management and its owners and players the lawyers johnnie cochran and cyrus mehri released a report last week called black coaches in the nfl superior performance inferior opportunities the report was developed by the labor economist janice madden from the university of pennsylvania and is supported by richard lapchick the race and sports authority and floyd keith executive director of the black coaches association among numerous findings the report said that african americans in the nfl were the last hired as head coaches and the first fired and that too few of them were involved in the interview process greg aiello the nfl 's vice president for public relations said the league had developed creative ways to address these issues realized their importance and welcomed constructive dialogue cochran said these numbers showed the need for substantive change before the nfl 's next head coaching hiring cycle which usually begins in january since 1920 the league has hired more than 400 head coaches and 6 of them 15 percent have been african american of the last 22 head coaching hires 2 have been african american and though african american players compose nearly 70 percent of the league the coordinators jobs are 72 percent white and 28 percent african american and the head coaching jobs are 94 percent white compared with 6 percent african american the league currently has 32 teams and two black head coaches cochran and mehri said they were not interested in quotas but specifically in the league 's interviewing more african americans for these vacancies they want commissioner paul tagliabue to use draft picks as a reward or penalty not only to provide incentive for owners to interview and hire more african american head coaches but also to diversify club front offices with more members of minority groups including women and hispanics aiello said that in the last five years nfl teams had interviewed 15 african americans for head coaching jobs a total of 23 times and 3 became head coaches they need a game plan for change because what they are doing is not working cochran said in the last three years it has gone backward not forward some of these owners have exhibited a mentality that they are not going to change unless you have a carrot stick concept tie this issue into draft picks and you will see results aiello said the league believed that because more african american assistant coaches are in the league than ever from that pool african american head coaches will emerge in 1980 he said the league had 14 black coaches in 1997 it had 103 with 5 of them coordinators and 3 of them head coaches it now has 154 and 12 are coordinators he said that from the league 's minority coaching internship program conducted during training camp 50 participants now have jobs as nfl coaches and one herman edwards is a head coach with the jets mehri said that the way the nfl states its position on the issue sounds similar to that of texaco and coca cola corporations against whom mehri won major race discrimination suits totaling nearly 368 million the nfl has been struggling with this issue regarding african american coaches over the years mehri said i 've been fighting for african americans in the corporate ranks where they have to fight hard to go half as far as their white counterparts when you see a denny green fired after the record he has built and then not get a new job or marvin lewis coach the best defense ever win a super bowl and two years later not have a head job you know that something is wrong the nfl is part of the epicenter of this country when kids today see so few african american head coaches what does that tell them the fans are being cheated a lot of african american coaches are better qualified than some of the people currently holding the job and our data shows that in a league where 70 percent of the players are african american someday those players are going to retire what does that mean to them when an option important to many of them is shut down you 've got one african american general manager in this league ozzie newsome in baltimore let 's empower the commissioner and create change or let the courts decide mehri said first mehri and cochran would like to help the league develop a plan that works otherwise apparently a suit will be filed in federal court in new york the nfl is not above the law mehri said but there is some arrogance there art modell the baltimore ravens owner said that if he listened to cochran he 'd have o j simpson coaching my team modell added we have a system in this league and color is not a factor this is such a competitive business and we want to get the one guy coaching our teams who can turn the juice on regardless of his color and i have a question since allie sherman coached the giants in the 60 's why have n't there been any jewish head coaches in the league what 's the difference this is like the middle linebackers the centers the coordinators and the quarterbacks in our league there are more african americans in those positions now and the wall has been brought down there are n't many african american coaches in the colleges right now but we 've had some growth in the numbers of our assistant coaches and coordinators it 's coming if it goes to court they 'll lose cochran responded why should these coaches have to wait why is it that a guy like sherman lewis experienced and successful sees one of the guys that used to report to him on the minnesota staff mike tice get a head coaching job in minnesota before he does there is a major glass ceiling and we want to negotiate a plan that creates constructive change before we litigate but we are prepared to litigate and we have the stamina resources and commitment to see this through
