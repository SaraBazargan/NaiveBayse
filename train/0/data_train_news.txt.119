 jason kidd wore the souvenirs of the nets western conference trip on his knees scabs and bruises of varying shades of purple that he had collected on five courts victories against the los angeles lakers and the denver nuggets helped to salve the wounds of defeats in the first three games of the trip but kidd earned a brighter badge yesterday for the second straight season he was the only nets player named as a reserve to the eastern conference all star team it will be his sixth appearance in nine seasons nets coach byron scott had hoped the other conference coaches would also choose kenyon martin as a reserve six teams will have more than one representative i do n't think it says anything bad about our team said scott whose nets 30 14 are in first place in the atlantic division kidd was looking forward to going to atlanta for the all star game on feb 9 instead of taking the time to relax that is time off kidd said monday night anticipating his selection it 's great it 's just a goal i work for every time in the summer to be considered one of the best players in the league kidd who was the runner up to tim duncan as the nba 's most valuable player last season dedicated himself to improving his shooting it seems to have helped kidd a point guard who will be a free agent after this season is averaging 204 points and shooting 44 percent from the floor better than his career averages of 142 points and 403 percent kidd who scored a season high 41 points last thursday in his oakland homecoming against golden state totaled 101 points in the three road losses martin a third year forward leads the nets in rebounding 84 a game and is third in scoring 143 points behind kidd and richard jefferson 152 who will be participating in the slam dunk contest during all star weekend martin 's rocky start on the trip both mirrored and affected the nets in the nets loss to utah on jan 20 he shot 2 for 10 before fouling out with six minutes remaining in regulation martin was not under the basket to defend karl malone who scored on a last second put back to send the game into overtime in the next game martin guarded sacramento 's chris webber who scored a game high 36 points as the kings won although martin did have 17 points and 13 rebounds martin shot 4 for 21 in the loss to golden state we were in every game we just did n't pull it out in the end martin said we learned from that and did n't let it linger on though he continued to shoot poorly last friday against the lakers martin persevered scoring 18 points late in the game he hit a clutch jumper made two free throws and had a game clinching dunk he had 17 points and 9 rebounds in monday 's 92 66 rout in denver martin said he was not expecting to be an all star and added that he would gladly take the four day break as far away from america as possible the nets have five games remaining before the all star game break they play at home tonight against washington and friday against new orleans before a game at detroit on saturday now all we have to do is start looking forward scott said the toughest part of our schedule is pretty much behind us before the all star break we want to make sure we get a nice little roll going michael jordan will probably make his last regular season appearance at continental arena tonight the wizards are 22 23 after monday 's victory over phoenix jordan averaging 182 points a game will make his 14th all star appearance his first as a reserve i think when he leaves the game i 'm going to remember him as a bull scott said i 'm not going to remember him as a wizard the things he achieved in chicago i do n't think two years in washington is going to tarnish that scott is trying not to envision kidd in a different uniform next season he said he also does not consider how everything the nets do may affect kidd 's decision to stay or go no maybe i should but it really does n't enter my mind scott said all i 'm thinking about is winning games i do n't go into the game saying we got to win this game or we got to do this to keep jason i just ca n't think like that
