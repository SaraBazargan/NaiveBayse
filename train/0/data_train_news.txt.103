 a rain delay of 3 hours 36 minutes preceded today 's national league division series game adding to the st louis cardinals anxiety they realized they had wasted an opportunity friday night when their bullpen blew a seventh inning lead in game 3 leaving them on the verge of elimination in the three of five game series when the rain finally ended st louis used the pitching of a rookie the power of a veteran and an unlikely home run to construct a 4 1 victory over the arizona diamondbacks at busch stadium and force a decisive game 5 on sunday we keep bouncing back and playing like champs cardinals manager tony la russa said hopefully sunday night we can do it again and be champs of something the cardinals ended the regular season with a loss at houston allowing the astros to win the central division and celebrate home field advantage in the playoffs st louis was sent to phoenix as the wild card jim edmonds growing accustomed to the postseason stage and fernando vina who normally does not hit with much power each homered and the rookie bud smith produced five taxing but effective innings for the cardinals on friday in a 5 3 defeat the cardinals were undone by craig counsell 's first career home run off a left handed pitcher today st louis shifted the series back to phoenix setting up a rematch of game 1 curt schilling threw a three hit shutout to beat matt morris 1 0 on tuesday in a matchup of baseball 's only 22 game winners morris suggested before today 's game that schilling would have trouble meeting the high standard he set last week i 'm wondering if he could pitch any better morris said it 's tough for him he 's got to go out there and throw a complete game shutout again to match his performance when the rain began this morning the cardinals were willing to wait as long as necessary to play a rainout would have allowed the diamondbacks to pitch schilling in game 4 and randy johnson in game 5 sat around bored out of my mind hoping we would play vina said vina led the offense going 3 for 3 he stole second base and scored the cardinals first run in the first inning caught smith 's pickoff throw of tony womack at second base in the third and hit a two run home run in the bottom of the inning it was no secret we had to win this game vina said i did everything i could to get the ball rolling for us smith a rookie left hander held the diamondbacks to one run on four hits and four walks in five innings leaving because of a high pitch count la russa managed this game as he has the others this series with the belief that runs were at a premium placido polanco the no 2 hitter had three sacrifice bunts tying joe tinker 's 95 year old record for a postseason game set in the 1906 world series only one of the four batters polanco advanced scored arizona 's starter albie lopez was a 19 game loser this season with tampa bay and arizona and he did not last long he left after surrendering four runs in three innings after arizona took a 1 0 lead in the first lopez allowed a run in the bottom of the inning when he was late covering first base allowing vina to score on j d drew 's infield single edmonds who homered friday night led off the second with an opposite field drive to left to make the score 2 1 the home run was edmonds 's fifth in the postseason lopez retired the next three batters before he walked smith a 160 hitter to open the third vina followed by pulling a 1 0 pitch off the netting on the right field foul pole for a two run homer vina hit nine home runs this season and has 35 in 3244 career at bats smith with the help of two relievers made vina 's blast stand up smith was not as dominant as other pitchers in this series but he sent arizona 's batters back into a funk besides the five runs they scored on friday the diamondbacks have scored one run in each of the other three games smith threw 98 pitches including 35 in the first inning and handed a 4 1 lead to dustin hermanson who threw three perfect innings steve kline recorded the save and anticipated having the celebration that the cardinals have yet to enjoy this year now it 's maybe time to go out and celebrate on somebody else 's turf he said
