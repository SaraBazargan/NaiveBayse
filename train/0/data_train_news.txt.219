 nasa safety advisers said today that the agency should seriously study crew escape systems for the space shuttle and deploy them or re examine the high risk of human space flight in releasing its annual report to the space agency the experts the nasa aerospace safety advisory panel repeated earlier calls to study methods to allow a crew to escape a crippled shuttle at any point the panel which finished the report before the columbia accident on feb 1 that killed seven astronauts generally praised nasa as putting safety first but it criticized the agency for moving slowly on recommendations that it made in two previous reports to commit to building escape systems in past years the panel has been very concerned about the lack of crew escape systems appropriate to all regions of powered flight on board the space shuttle the nine member committee said it is clear that such systems will significantly increase the chance for crew survival in case of a major mishap the 106 page report covers the year immediately preceding the columbia accident and did not comment on it directly or the investigation into its cause in a meeting with the nasa administrator sean o'keefe the committee noted significant and inherent risks in flying the shuttle the agency is considering upgrades to systems that will improve safety including new power systems advanced electronics and new tires for the landing gear but the panel said the risk of losing another shuttle and its crew would remain high sidney m gutierrez a panel member who is a former shuttle astronaut and a former air force colonel said the risk of flying in the shuttle was significant on launching and returning to meet the agency 's stated safety goals for human space flight mr gutierrez said the answer would be a full crew escape system he said that the agency conducted early studies on an escape capsule that would enclose a entire crew and that the military had demonstrated that group and individual escape pods could be built that worked with high speed military aircraft noting that the shuttle had a demonstrated rate of catastrophic failure of one in 75 flights mr gutierrez added the agency could lose one or more of the three remaining shuttles if it continued to fly them until 2020 mr o'keefe said that the agency was working to make space flight safer and that the only way to eliminate the risk entirely was to stop flying a question to ask is can we tolerate the risk inherent in space exploration he said is the risk which is high acceptable as a consequence of being in an early phase of space exploration mr o'keefe cautioned against prematurely choosing one way of improving safety like escape pods nasa officials noted that the proposed orbital space plane which would carry crews but not cargo to and from the international space station is supposed to be much safer than the shuttle but early design requirements specify the desired levels of safety not ways to achieve it like escape pods the space officials said dr bernard a harris jr another former astronaut who is a consultant to the safety panel said nasa needed to change its view of crew safety dr harris agreed with mr gutierrez that the approach had been returning the crew safely by landing the spacecraft safely the focus he said should be on crew safety even if it means sacrificing the spacecraft
