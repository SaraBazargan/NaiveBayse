 to the editor i consider it tragic the simplistic and superficial fashion in which mental health problems are generally being handled in this country some still prefer the couch yes psychoanalysis being an extremely difficult profession has made many mistakes and is still evolving and it is not for everyone but the comments of those interviewed in the article are quite common among those of us who have made the commitment to psychoanalysis this form of therapy has suffered too long under a way of thinking propagated by hollywood and those in the profession who have little knowledge of it further psychoanalysis is not just a treatment style but a way of conceptualizing human problems that can be useful in different contexts it is knowledge that needs to be shared john lundin san francisco
