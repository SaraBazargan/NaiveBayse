 the xfl pro wrestling 's prodigal football hybrid is close to making giants stadium the home of its new york area franchise putting games on the stadium 's new experimental grass field during february and march people familiar with the lease negotiations have said the new jersey sports and exposition authority owners of giants stadium and the world wrestling federation which created the league with the help of a 30 million investment from nbc have been talking for several weeks with the consent of the giants and the jets representatives for the authority and the wwf declined to comment on the negotiations other officials involved with the talks said the wwf was eager to play at giants stadium because of the credibility and visibility it would bring the fledging league and was also willing to pay for some of the field maintenance costs the authority would receive revenue during a period when the stadium has traditionally been dormant as part of their lease agreements the giants and the jets would receive a small percentage of the parking and concession profits for any professional football games at giants stadium the xfl is scheduled to begin play in eight cities on feb 3 2001 keeping the grass healthy was my initial concern said john mara the giants executive vice president referring to the grass tray field installed in march but i was assured it was going to be ok we do n't have any problem with them coming in after playing 24 football seasons on artificial turf the authority with the urging of the giants agreed last year to change to a permanent grass surface the metrostars of the major soccer league have been playing on a similar field for several years but for the first time this fall the giants and the jets are scheduled to play their regular season home games on grass the xfl presents the sports authority with an opportunity to maximize its potential for revenue and it 's our obligation and desire to cooperate said steve gutman the jets president our concerns about the field surface and facilities were discussed and addressed and we 're comfortable the field is actually a patchwork of more than 6000 plastic grass trays with a revolutionary subterranean engineering system that can heat cool feed and moisturize the grass the design includes a network of implanted computer sensors that adjust to the differing needs of the playing surface more heat for the parts in the shade less heat for the parts in the sun scott clark whose clark companies installed the field said he thinks the xfl players might be more comfortable playing on the field during bad weather the grass surface can be heated to nearly 60 degrees if you 're standing on that field the heat is going to radiate up through it clark said clark also said he could help the sports authority melt the snow that gathered in the grandstand before games if they could push it down to the sidelines he said we could melt it clark conceded that the current field was not planned with year round use in mind but the project did call for thousands of the grass trays in the center of the field to be replaced every six weeks beginning in september if the giants or the jets make the playoffs the plan was to replace the center of the field in january anyway clark said his field could melt up to three inches of snow as it was falling if a bigger storm was coming we would put a tarp over the field then plow it off and melt the snow on the sideline said clark whose company recently studied the last 40 years of winter weather readings at newark airport we 've been tinkering with all the possibilities and all the components were already in place so we 're ready although i guess you could say we 're pretty sure the car will run but we have n't started it yet the metrostars would be the first team to use the field after the xfl a metrostars spokesman said that nick sakiewicz the team 's general manager was traveling in florida yesterday sakiewicz could not be reached for comment
