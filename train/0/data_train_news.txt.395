 to the editor regarding been up so long it looks like down nov 19 about empty stores in downtown millburn it would be easy to assume that the presence of an upscale mall in short hills or the many discount stores along route 22 have caused commercial property to go unoccupied in millburn but a more thorough analysis would lead one to conclude that it is a lack of vision on the part of downtown landlords and merchants and of the municipal government that are the real problems millburn is now involved in an effort to reinvent itself the cries most often heard are why ca n't we be like maplewood village or madison or why ca n't we get a big box store in here to draw people to the downtown the only chance for progress is for the various parties to acknowledge the downtown infrastructure with all its limitations this certainly did not happen under the last downtown alliance study proposal that actually wanted the city government to condemn certain parcels to add more commercial space what millburn can do is build upon the assets it does have like brokerage operations and financial institutions perhaps we can not get college students from a nearby campus to stroll in without cars as madison and south orange have done or create the downtown ambience of maplewood village but if various parties would look to make buildings smart buildings then perhaps we can attract more of the type of businesses that would compliment what is already downtown this may regenerate downtown or at the least bring us a cybercafe as for the abandoned saks site it would be terrific if the use could be redirected to a residential one or perhaps a satellite campus for a higher learning institution but that may be hoping for too much abbott gorin millburn
