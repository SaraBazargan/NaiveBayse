 no offense has been more productive or more pulverizing than the st louis rams over the last three seasons but in their past two games the loss to new england in the super bowl and sunday 's slip up against denver the rams scored 17 and 16 points there is hand wringing and head scratching over the offense from rams management coaches and players there is a notion that defenses especially the nfl 's superior ones have a formula to finally shackle this band of speed bandits there is a concern that since defenses have a history and a knack of eventually suppressing hybrid offenses this is what is happening the rams scoring machine as we have come to know it is being negated this is the current popular method to choke the rams hit them hard and hit them harder turnovers will ensue and their receivers become gun shy put pressure on quarterback kurt warner with four linemen and little blitzing play plenty of two deep coverage and prevent big plays tackle well tampa bay got the scheme started even though it lost the 1999 national football conference championship game to the rams 11 6 new orleans over the last couple of seasons has found success with the formula the giants continued the theme in a 15 14 loss to the rams last season then new england perfected it in the super bowl denver 's defense followed suit it did it so well that the rams managed only one touchdown in the 23 16 loss at denver and that came on a 3 yard third quarter run by marshall faulk not with their imposing passing game the giants visit st louis on sunday and their defense has high hopes that it can continue the trend to punish the rams offense into submission we are now starting to hear about the rams what was said a decade ago about the great san francisco offense when it finally began to slide offensively the rams rely too much on timing and not enough on power they do more prancing than they are physical the insulting two words finesse team is enveloping the rams again the rams play with more finesse and we had our minds made up that we were going to play very physical denver defensive end trevor pryce said how physical we took a lot of super bowl film and saw new england really popping guys in the mouth and we saw they did n't like that denver linebacker john mobley said that was something that we wanted to do hit them when they were n't looking and even when they were looking lay something on them that 's what we did and it showed they did n't want to catch the ball late in the game defensive end keith washington said our guys were flying all around making big hits today i think we may have shocked them with how we kept fighting and pressuring warner even rams tight end ernie conwell conceded they did a great job of hitting us in the mouth rams coach mike martz after denver jumped to a 10 0 lead and a 16 6 first half edge said they took the fight to us and shook us up a bit imagine that the rams preening offense all shook up actually the rams were defiant after the loss some of them privately said that they believe they are a much better team than denver that they simply made occasional critical mistakes that cost them the game and that their offensive line did not play well but can and will play much better the two glaring problems for the rams offense were its lack of a running game only a yard rushing in the first half and 32 for the game and martz 's penchant for the big play instead of the steady one with his team trailing denver 16 13 and with the ball at the denver 9 martz chose to go for a first down on a fourth and 1 pass instead of attempting to kick a field goal to tie the game the play failed martz defended the call by saying we 're aggressive and we 'll always be aggressive you make a deal like that and you energize your football team the problem was the rams were already energized in the second half and tying the score would have energized them more in the big picture aggressiveness is good in that situation it was a horrible call because the gap between the rams offense and the league 's better defenses is closing now the giants defense and their new coordinator johnnie lynn are intent on closing that gap even tighter we know we 're a better team than we showed and we want to get back to balance in our offense warner said we have a lot of pride on offense and we want to get back on top of our game the rams are counting on that but the good defenses in the league see a crack worth exploiting
