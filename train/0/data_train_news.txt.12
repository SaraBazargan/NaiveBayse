 when manager joe torre reached the mound in the bottom of the seventh inning tonight he clapped his hands before taking the ball from jose contreras it seemed to be an empty gesture because there was little for contreras to celebrate after a month away from the yankees he had failed miserably in his return contreras 's december signing touched off a feud between the yankees principal owner george steinbrenner and the red sox president larry lucchino who both bid for contreras after he defected from cuba when contreras struggled early and was sent to tampa instead of class aaa columbus torre quarreled with steinbrenner the question now is what was all the fuss about contreras got out of a jam tonight but created another and the yankees have still gotten nothing from their four year 32 million investment in him contreras threw fastballs reaching 95 miles an hour but he allowed five runs and got only four outs blowing the lead in the seventh inning of a 10 7 loss to the boston red sox pedro martinez missed his start because of a strained muscle below his right shoulder blade but the red sox won anyway feasting on contreras and jeff weaver after the game torre was still stressing the positive praising contreras for throwing confidently after seeming so tentative in april it is a worthwhile strategy for a sensitive pitcher like contreras who admitted before the game that he put too much pressure on himself early on partly because of his contract i was very pleased torre said i thought this was more of a plus than a minus in the long run i thought his command was much better than when he left i thought his stuff was better and he seemed to be more confident in letting the ball go the yankees believe contreras can be a premier starter a notion shared by the red sox who offered him a four year 27 million deal but there is no place in the rotation unless the struggling weaver is bumped weaver has allowed 72 hits in 57 2 3 innings and opponents are batting 308 against him he gave up five runs on seven hits and four walks and did not record an out in the sixth it 's been back and forth pretty much the whole start of the season weaver said way too many walks i 'm not a guy who picks corners i go right after guys mechanically i feel good at times and for some reason i might lose it weaver will have time to smooth his mechanics torre said it would be unfair to consider pulling him from the rotation even with contreras back no not now torre said jeff weaver is an established starter of course contreras is also but i think we 'd like to go a little bit longer and see what happens we 're all pitching for a spot all the starters we have to compete every day it 's nothing new i do n't think we 're trying to apply that kind of pressure there 's enough pressure in this game without threatening people the game had started with such promise for the yankees martinez 's replacement bruce chen gave up a homer to alfonso soriano on the first pitch of the game the yankees scored again in the inning and held a 3 1 lead after two but boston steadily hammered weaver who kept leaving pitches up in the strike zone the red sox had five extra base hits off him the last a two run homer by jason varitek that gave them a 4 3 lead after four the former yankee ramiro mendoza relieved chen and gave up four consecutive singles allowing the yankees to go ahead when weaver left in the sixth the yankees had a 6 5 lead with two runners on and no one out contreras got a double play grounder and a strikeout ending the inning torre believed he had found a solution to the yankees setup relief problems i had visions of him taking us right to mo torre said referring to closer mariano rivera i was very confident with him going out there for the next inning contreras who said his mechanics were a total disaster in april started the seventh working from the stretch which had felt comfortable in the sixth but he walked the leadoff man todd walker i tried to overprotect that one run lead contreras said through an interpreter i should have just gone right after him and attacked him contreras jammed the next hitter nomar garciaparra with a splitter but garciaparra blooped a double to left off the end of his bat and an intentional walk to manny ramirez loaded the bases contreras tried to throw david ortiz a fastball off the plate but he missed his spot and ortiz bashed a two run double to the warning track in deep left center the red sox led 7 6 and continued to pile on i faced contreras once in spring training and all he was throwing was off speed pitches ortiz said i saw him tonight throwing a lot of fastballs i guess they 've been working on that i guess somebody told him that the big league club is different from whatever he played before he 's got a good fastball he 's got to use it that was contreras 's plan and catcher jorge posada was pleased to see him execute it i thought he was more aggressive posada said his stuff was better and he came after hitters it 's just a matter of time to put it all together that time was not tonight contreras has a 1563 earned run average and no answers for his struggles he pitched well in the minors tightened his mechanics restored his confidence he is still waiting for results
