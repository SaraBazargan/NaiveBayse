 a federal judge ruled wednesday that hasim rahman did not violate a long term contract with his former promoter when he signed a deal with don king in may to have king promote him but the judge miriam goldman cedarbaum said the former promoter cedric kushner had the legal right to act as rahman 's promoter in an expected rematch between rahman and lennox lewis the british heavyweight fighter who lost his international boxing federation and world boxing council titles to rahman in april after returning from that five round upset in south africa rahman dropped kushner and signed with king who tried to arrange a fight against david izon in beijing on aug 5 lewis and kushner each sued rahman and king saying they had breached contracts that rahman had signed cedarbaum ruled last week in federal district court in manhattan that rahman had to first fulfill a contractual obligation to give lewis a rematch before fighting anyone else for 18 months although kushner has the contractual right to sell rahman 's services in a rematch cedarbaum wrote in her decision the violation of that right is not so irreparable that it can not be compensated for by monetary damages what that means is that king can act as rahman 's promoter in the lewis rematch but he and rahman will have to pay kushner damages for a contractual breach a trial to determine the amount of damages is scheduled for october kushner 's lawyer rich edlin said that at a minimum king owed kushner all the money he would make off the rematch as far as we 're concerned king is working for us he said king said i do n't feed into that he declined yesterday to comment further but kushner 's side is not entirely pleased with the decision although edlin had argued that the rahman kushner promotion agreement should have lasted until mid june and that it had been extended beyond that with a 75000 check kushner had given one of rahman 's managers cedarbaum ruled that the original contract had expired in mid april at the latest king who agreed to give rahman a 5 million signing bonus in may is now legally rahman 's promoter before rahman left kushner hbo was offering 14 million to rahman to have a rematch with lewis while showtime was offering 20 million for a rahman mike tyson fight both of those deals were scrapped when king announced the rahman izon fight but now that rahman must fight lewis and there is no possibility of a bidding war it is almost certain that rahman will not get anything close to the original offer for the lewis bout the rahman izon fight had been scheduled on the undercard of a heavyweight title fight between evander holyfield and john ruiz the world boxing association champion the night the judge decided rahman must fight lewis a cable television company rainbow sports network backed out of a tentative agreement it had with king to distribute the beijing fight king said yesterday that his own television company kingvision will distribute the fight
