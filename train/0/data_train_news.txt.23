 oops the yankees celebrated too soon on orders from george m steinbrenner the team wanted not to have the major leagues highest opening day payroll and on sunday thought they had achieved their quest when it appeared that the boston red sox were no 1 but yesterday a recalculation based on the present day value of manny ramirez 's contract lowered the red sox total and bumped the yankees into their customary top spot the yankees payroll made up of 25 players on the roster and 6 players on the disabled list is 109801893 boston 's payroll with 25 active and 7 disabled players had been computed at 111505833 including 15 million for ramirez a 13 million salary and a 2 million share of his 16 million signing bonus however when the players association and the labor relations department of major league baseball determine their opening day payrolls the red sox figure will be about 2 million less because part of ramirez 's salary and signing bonus will be deferred without interest the players association reduces the 2001 value to 12932275 while baseball lowers it to 13033075 either figure drops the red sox to approximately 1095 million or 300000 below the yankees murray chass
