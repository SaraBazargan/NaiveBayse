 you have to admire the fortitude if not question the sanity of a nation that would put its political fate in the hands of two of the more despised groups in the land lawyers and journalists who in the last week have dominated our consciousness more than television 's talking heads and the candidates legal advisers it was n't enough that the networks mangled election night with the presidential campaign in overtime they have stirred an air of crisis through breathless wall to wall coverage even though the country seems to be bumping along as well or as poorly as ever meanwhile you practically need c130 's to carry all the lawyers parachuting into florida more than a few of them happen also to be politicians often enough so are the news people this is not exactly a new phenomenon still traditional lines separating the worlds of politics and journalism are being crossed and recrossed with some regularity these days when they are not being erased altogether consider patrick j buchanan the reform party candidate and chief beneficiary of those electorally challenged people in palm beach county fla now that mr buchanan 's presidential quest is over he may well recast himself as a television commentator or syndicated columnist he has done that several times before using his national audience to render political judgments while gearing up for his next run at the white house he has been in and out of cnn so many times that there must be a revolving door named after him in atlanta bay buchanan his sister and lead strategist said that for the next few months he 's looking at a couple of books after that he could be back to tv and radio also to writing a column she said though adding that nothing had been decided in other words do n't be surprised if mr buchanan winds up on the air yet again not that he is the only one to play this game geraldine a ferraro went from failed vice presidential candidate to crossfire sharpshooter to failed senate candidate then back and forth yet again before returning to the chattering class by now she deserves her own revolving door no sooner did alfonse m d'amato lose his senate seat from new york than he began shedding opinions left and right mostly right he now does a weekly pas de deux for new york magazine with another man who fell from electoral grace former mayor edward i koch political aides also get into the act tony blankley who tried to make newt gingrich an acquired taste works as a sunday morning kibitzer for nbc george stephanopoulos who helped give us president clinton does much the same for abc they are the political equivalents of baseball players who take refuge in the broadcasting booth after hanging up their spikes and who in some instances then scramble back into the game as team managers at least with messrs blankley and stephanopoulos the fence once hopped has stayed hopped for now at least they have followed in the tradition of more established commentators who once worked for politicians like bill moyers william safire diane sawyer and tim russert and what you may wonder is so terribly wrong with this form of switch hitting when did journalists become cloistered monks on that score you 'd get no argument from mitchell stephens who teaches journalism and mass communications at new york university if pat buchanan would want to take over dan rather 's anchor chair at cbs that would be a little odd he said but short of that i do n't have a problem tom goldstein dean of columbia university 's school of journalism would impose a one strike rule on the switch hitters i think you can go through the revolving door once in either direction he said then you have to make up your mind by his standards mr buchanan is damaged goods if you ask alex s jones director of harvard university 's joan shorenstein center on the press politics and public policy all this shuttling between back rooms and newsrooms is plain unpleasant not to mention bad news it tends to make people think that journalism is just about having opinions and not being fair and going after the truth he said mr jones will be allowed the last word a columnist 's prerogative of course you never know maybe with all these recounts mr buchanan will pick up enough votes to persuade him to stick to politics for good and give journalism a pass do n't bet the farm on it though
