 tim carter bounced up from the sideline certain he had made the catch that would turn around his fortunes in the giants offense it was the fourth quarter of monday night 's game against dallas just after the giants tied the score at 29 29 and seized the momentum quarterback kerry collins had thrown to carter deep on first down a ball he dived for and thought he had caught at the cowboys 26 it would have been a huge play and far more significant than the 34 yards it would have gained when the officials signaled no catch carter threw up his arms and argued giants coach jim fassel challenged the call to no avail though carter had his feet inbounds he was juggling the ball as he fell maybe if there were a few more inches or the rules were a little bit different the play would have gone a different way and everything would be in a different light carter said but in the harsh light of a big moment it wound up like many plays for carter this season agonizingly close to being wonderful he seems just a few inches from becoming the dangerous and dependable third receiver the giants need with ron dixon out with a knee injury carter sees the opportunity before him the giants like to run three receiver sets it was their most effective formation against dallas partly because teams like to blanket receivers amani toomer and ike hilliard the third wide receiver is going to draw their third best corner and if your third guy is better than their third guy it 's going to be to your advantage collins said he can be that guy for us and i think he will be carter is blessed with great speed good size 6 feet 200 pounds and talent that the giants coaches can not wait to mold into an offensive weapon he was a second round draft choice out of auburn in 2002 but his rookie season was a frustrating injury plagued one he finally seemed ready to break out taking the place of the injured hilliard in two games but he tore his right achilles tendon in the ninth game and was lost for the rest of the season he made an impressively quick comeback and worked so hard in the off season that the receivers coach jimmy robinson was stunned at how much he had learned without playing the big hurdle was doing what he had learned in games carter made a few of those infuriatingly close plays in the preseason letting passes slip off his fingertips or not keeping his feet inbounds but fassel remained determined to keep trying to get him the ball collins threw to him nine times against the cowboys he caught 3 passes for 28 yards not all the incompletions were his fault collins said he could have thrown a better ball on that fourth quarter pass but it was still catchable we 've got to have him make those plays for us fassel said he 's a talent i like him fassel 's and collins 's eyes light up when talking about carter his misses have not yet swayed their opinion his potential still outshines the mistakes the biggest mistake we can make is not throw to him or not play him robinson said he 's just got to get out there and play i have n't lost any confidence in him carter says he has not lost confidence in himself either he is happy for the chance to work with and learn from toomer and hilliard he says he is thrilled the giants want to use a three receiver set more than they did last season he just wants to get his hands on the ball to earn the trust of collins in key situations carter said i can see ike and kerry ike is given the option to freelance sometimes to do his own thing but their timing is so impressive it 's amazing how they 're on the same page they 're thinking the same thing kerry anticipates well anyway his ball placement he does that naturally but some plays you think how did they do that carter is learning sometimes the hard way extra points defensive end keith hamilton is still questionable with a hamstring injury all the other regulars practiced friday including left tackle luke petitgout and are expected to play
