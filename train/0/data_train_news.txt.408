 it has become as familiar to knicks fans as latrell sprewell 's cornrows you see it every week if not every game it is the sight of kurt thomas the knicks growling power forward complaining to a referee about a foul call before stomping angrily toward the bench usually midway through the first quarter thomas has a new theory why he is always being whistled for infractions the referees he says are out to get him i think it 's obvious thomas said today before the knicks flew to cleveland for friday 's game against the cavaliers i think if you just look at the tape you see some bad calls called on me but i do n't worry about it i just give them an ugly look say a few words and then go the other way perhaps thomas should start worrying about it because the foul problems that have plagued him throughout his seven year career are worse than ever thomas averaged 33 minutes a game through the first 20 games this season but his reckless fouling has dropped his playing time to an average of 247 minutes over the last eight games he has averaged just 78 points and 65 rebounds during that stretch after fouling out twice in the first 20 games thomas has fouled out twice in the last four the knicks 13 15 were fortunate to overcome thomas 's foul woes in tuesday 's 102 94 victory over toronto in which he fouled out in just 20 minutes but with clarence weatherspoon about two weeks away from returning from a partially torn tendon in his right foot and center marcus camby battling foot problems the knicks will have trouble winning if thomas spends too much time on the bench camby who missed tuesday 's game with a sore left foot said today that he would play against cleveland he did not practice today and is still experiencing soreness but with the help of some anti inflammatory pills he said he hoped to fight through the pain i just try not to think about it just go out there and play said camby who has two swollen bones on the bottom of his foot when i feel right i 'm going to play and play well so i 'm looking forward tomorrow to playing well the knicks will need both camby and thomas near the tops of their games against cleveland the cavaliers are only 11 17 but they are not nearly as bad as their record when their 7 foot 3 inch center zydrunas ilgauskas is healthy ilgauskas who has been hampered by foot problems his whole career has played the last 11 games averaging 13 points 49 rebounds and 19 minutes a game he made his first start in wednesday 's 91 89 loss to the nets and had 15 points and 12 rebounds in a season high 25 minutes the 7 footer chris mihm started beside ilgauskas coach don chaney is thinking of starting thomas on ilgauskas so camby can give help and block shots while coming over from the weak side of course that plan will go nowhere if thomas can not stay out of foul trouble chaney said thomas was not exaggerating about the officials chaney said he believed the officials probably do n't like thomas in large part because of thomas 's frowning and complaining after calls if you 're a good defender you 've got to be able to have a relationship with the referees where if you think they did n't make a call you can walk over to them in a polite manner and say that was a bad call or whatever chaney said then you may get some sympathy the next time but you ca n't just go and jump down a guy 's throat because that angers him and then you 're not going to get any benefits from that point on but thomas said he was not about to start smiling at the officials that 's kind of hard for me because i do n't really smile that much thomas said partly in jest the only time i might smile is when i 'm with my family when i 'm with my kids i ca n't change the way i play i 'm going to always play aggressive and i 'm going to always play hard and if i pick up tick tack fouls i pick up tick tack fouls after replacing the retired larry johnson in the starting lineup thomas was expected to have a big season but he is averaging only 101 points 84 rebounds and shooting a paltry 432 percent i have n't had a good game all year said thomas who has season highs of 17 points and 13 rebounds as soon as i get like a 20 point and 14  or 15 rebound game then i 'll think i 'm having a good game but until then i 'm not playing well i 'm struggling it 's been a tough year for me pro basketball
