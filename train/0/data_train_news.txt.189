 the answers about what is wrong with the jets run defense are starting to sound repetitive so the outcome against the st louis rams should not have been a surprise it takes a superior defense to contain the rams offense and it has been obvious for most of their six games that the jets are not close to being superior the jets do not have a single player like michael strahan of the giants who can wreak havoc on his own the jets defense on the other hand is a roll of the dice during sunday 's 34 14 loss the jets gave up 234 yards rushing including two trick plays their defense is the lowest ranked in the nfl i actually felt like we were in the game coach herman edwards said it was 7 7 and with four minutes left in the second quarter we self destruct we come out in the second half and that 's the game they gain 166 yards we gain 8 we have three plays on offense we 've played that way all year that 's why we 're 3 3 if we continue to play like that we 'll continue to win some and lose some there is no reason to believe the inconsistency will stop shane burton who had started the past three games at defensive tackle is doubtful for sunday 's game against carolina with a calf injury the rookie james reed played nose tackle for steve martin after martin moved to tackle after burton got hurt reed had five tackles and a fumble recovery but edwards said he also lined up in the wrong place three or four times reed and tom barndt will get more time this week and so will end rick lyle who had two sacks it 's a smorgasbord edwards said an example of the mental breakdowns that are pockmarking the jets season the failure to stop the rams on an option play that covered 56 yards for a touchdown even though they had practiced for it john abraham was supposed to tackle az zahir hakim in the backfield he did not and hakim broke downfield linebacker james farrior was playing between hakim and the pitch man trung canidate i thought he was going to pitch the ball farrior said i tried to make a play on the pitch and he kept the ball and went downfield i thought we had it down it showed up in the game and we did n't make the play then hakim made the pitch and canidate was gone we 've just got to be more consistent said safety victor green who had only one tackle we show flashes of greatness then we take a couple of steps back we knew we could beat this team we gave them what they got the rams tried to run the same play on their next drive and this time the jets read it correctly reed threw hakim for a 3 yard loss another example on a direct snap play to canidate the jets were in a maximum blitz with six players rushing one lineman edwards will not say who did not play his gap correctly and canidate ran straight ahead for a 12 yard touchdown edwards is adamant that he will not switch to a 3 4 defense that would require changing the defense in midseason then you 'd have to struggle for six seven eight games going that way edwards said where does shaun elis play he 's learning to play end already in a four man front abraham has to learn to play linebacker again he 's not playing end real good right now so how is he going to play linebacker all of a sudden this is how we 're going to build this football team with a 4 3 defense it does n't look good right now it was the same 4 3 defense that played the dolphins and shut them out in the second half extra points wayne chrebet had a cat scan monday he had more headaches and dizziness during the second quarter sunday after a helmet to helmet hit following a 6 yard reception at least four rams stood chrebet up at the end of the play and defensive tackle brian young came over the top and hit chrebet in the head coach herman edwards said the jets would send a tape of the hit to the league for review two snaps later chrebet threw a block on defensive end grant wistrom and then lay on his back with his hands over his face mask that was his last play of the game edwards had no problem with kurt warner 's signing autographs with about four minutes left warner faxed a note of apology to edwards if his coach lets him sign autographs that 's fine with me edwards said i 'm writing him back saying it 's a good deed on your part
