envelope in 1960 ms reagan said and i 've never stopped working she said that as an 11 year old watching television coverage of the 1952 presidential conventions she preferred the republicans because

on women 's issues she said no i have n't i think there could be a much better record and i would certainly place the blame i think where it belongs that 's in the hands of certain people on the senior staff who have never really accepted that there is a political power of women and that has to be addressed larry speakes a white house spokesman in the reagan administration noted in his book speaking out that the president 's aides including secretary of state george p shultz were afraid of ms reagan known to many as big mo you would avoid her if possible and agree with her if you had to deal with her mr speakes wrote ms reagan 's most active political years were in the 1980 's when she was a member of the california world trade commission chairwoman of the united states delegation to the united nations decade for women conference in kenya in 1985 co chairwoman of the republican national committee and chairwoman of the republican women 's political action league as ms reagan became
