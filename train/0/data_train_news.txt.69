 it was todd greene 's second game with the yankees and his first as a catcher for roger clemens a simple assignment as far as greene was concerned he felt no need to dictate pitch selection or establish his credibility no greene figured clemens would do whatever he wanted and greene would just catch whatever he threw it is easy deferring to a future hall of famer especially on a night when he is throwing pitches 96 miles an hour and the hitters only defense is to gape in improving his record to 7 1 clemens struck out 10 baltimore batters working eight innings and allowing only three hits in a 4 0 victory over the orioles last night at yankee stadium the yankees are 33 25 a game out of first place in the american league east at a time the front office is evaluating possible changes in preparation for the last two thirds of the season it was the 97th time in clemens 's career that he struck out 10 or more batters tying him for third place with sandy koufax nolan ryan ranks first with 215 randy johnson second with 134 it was also the 267th victory of clemens 's career lifting him into 30th place past bob feller and eppa rixey clemens had his first serious brushback incident of the season his target was jerry hairston whose confident air has irked the yankees this season hairston exacerbated the ill will in the early innings last night paul o'neill was attempting to steal second base when a pitch was fouled off in the second inning rather than alert o'neill and allow him to pull up seen as a professional courtesy by most players hairston said nothing and o'neill slid into second o'neill appeared to say something to hairston on his way back to first the next half inning hairston slammed his bat down after popping up and clemens glared at hairston as he rounded first clemens threw a pitch high and inside to hairston in the fifth but did not hit him then in the eighth clemens threw two more pitches high and inside to hairston before pumping a fastball behind hairston hairston barely eluded the pitch the umpires issued no warning hairston again popped up again slammed his bat clemens glaring at him some more the orioles sidney ponson seemed to attempt retaliation in the bottom of the eighth barely missing scott brosius several times with inside fastballs aside from the brushback pitches most of clemens 's work was over the plate he threw a two strike fastball to the outside corner to the first batter of the game brady anderson a pitch that appeared to be an inch or two off the fringe but the home plate umpire jeff kellogg called strike three establishing a pattern clemens kept pumping two strike fastballs to that spot and when he was not finishing hitters with that pitch he was doing it with a splitter he struck out three in the first inning another in the second two in the third at least one in every inning through the first seven innings the yankees scored in the second when tino martinez o'neill and brosius hit consecutive singles off ponson 3 4 with one out greene who made his yankee debut the night before ripped a double to left center and two more runs scored greene who is filling in while jorge posada 's sprained left thumb heals doubled home another run in the eighth during a three hit night
