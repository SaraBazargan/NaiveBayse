 for a half the jets had survived hanging close to the buffalo bills and their own slim playoff chances but when the teams came out of the locker room for the third period the bills knew where to attack the jets on the first drive of the second half the bills pounded the ball on the ground they gave the ball to travis henry 9 times and he gained 52 yards 10 more than he had in the first half henry finished the drive by slipping untouched into the end zone from 4 yards out giving the bills a 14 3 lead when the bills got the ball back they put it henry 's hands once again this time 7 times for 46 yards at the end of that drive they settled for a field goal the bills did not stop running until they had a 17 6 victory and henry had a career best 169 yards on 32 carries despite being hampered by a cracked fibula and sore ribs and the jets were once again left to ponder how to stop the run the jets defensive coordinator ted cotrell has a different philosophy than coach herman edwards cotrell made his reputation in buffalo while using a a 3 4 defense edwards has installed a 4 3 defense with the jets but cotrell said sunday that the jets troubles had less to do with strategy than with performance it 's not changing strategy cotrell said what else are you going to do the guys are there and they 're not making the play four weeks ago the oakland raiders started the game against the jets by running the ball 21 consecutive plays the bills rushed for 203 yards including 152 in the second half topping the 202 that dallas accumulated against the jets earlier this season henry became the seventh runner to top 100 yards against the jets and he put up the most yardage by far we had a bunch of missed tackles cotrell said it 's disturbing that you 'd have these missed tackles this time of the year we were hitting guys in the backfield several times we had him stopped for losses and he broke away that was the disturbing thing that 's been the thing all year we 're in position and we do n't finish that 's plagued us the whole year if we just slow the guy down we 'd have a chance that 's what i say 'slow him down if you ca n't do it yourself but that 's the way it 's gone the whole year for the jets the bills knew that and attacked that was a problem of theirs bills coach gregg williams said knowing that coming into the game you want to capitalize on it defensive tackle josh evans was in tears after the game jason ferguson muttered over and over this was one of the worst games i 've played cornerback ray mickens who made several saving tackles along with safety tyrone carter said they were just consistent they just kept on doing it they made a couple of adjustments they just played better than us we gave a 100 percent effort out there i know guys were hitting hitting hard we missed a couple of tackles that we did n't wrap up with but the effort was there the jets limited henry to 53 yards on 18 carries in their 30 3 victory in the third game of the season but it all evaporated even though they had entered the game on a roll and clinging to playoff hopes it 's very frustrating when you take pride in stopping the run and in november and december teams begin to run the ball more linebacker mo lewis said we knew what they were doing but we made mistakes and did not get the job done sam garnes added they ran the ball on us i know the game was n't pretty today it was a long day we knew they were going to run the ball if you ca n't stop the run you ca n't win the game pro football correction december 17 2003 wednesday a sports article on dec 8 about the inability of the jets defense to stop the buffalo bills offense in a 17 6 football loss misspelled the surname of the jets defensive coordinator he is ted cottrell not cotrell
