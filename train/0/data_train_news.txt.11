 players used to chase the dollar now they chase a championship ring this is one trend i hope catches on winning really does matter we talk about athletes and their pursuit of money and the criticism is often true but many athletes have discovered as they grow older that legacy assumes a greater importance in their lives there is no greater legacy in competitive sports than winning that 's why games are played and scores are recorded karl malone and gary payton took pay cuts to join the los angeles lakers with the hope of realizing their dreams of winning an nba championship we always focus on the negative with pro athletes grant hill of the orlando magic said friday night here 's an example of two guys who are about winning this says a lot about their character and priorities this says malone and payton handled their money well enough to pursue a dream in the days before free agency players basically had to stay with the team that first selected them they did n't have the luxury of jumping ship and going with an offer from a championship caliber team hill speaking from his home in orlando fla has watched the various comings and goings of his colleagues as he has come to grips with his own athletic mortality an ankle injury that he sustained while he was with the detroit pistons and that he aggravated in orlando has led to a series of operations that threaten his career a career that had been untouched by misfortune has taken a precarious turn as you get older your priorities change hill said most athletes as they get older have a sense of desperation they know that the end is near they had a great run made a lot of money now it 's about winning that 's why i 'm not surprised by what gary payton and karl malone did they 've always been about winning malone will turn 40 on july 24 he made 192 million last year he agreed to take the veterans minimum salary of 15 million to play for the lakers payton who turns 35 on july 23 earned 126 million last season with the lakers he will earn 49 million in the first year of a multiyear contract by contrast their new teammates shaquille o'neal and kobe bryant will make 265 million and 135 million respectively this season if you ca n't beat 'em join 'em payton and malone are the latest in a line of nba players whose path to a championship has been blocked in their case by one player michael jordan was a granite barrier for malone and for payton as well as for charles barkley and for patrick ewing barkley left the philadelphia 76ers for the phoenix suns in pursuit of a ring in 1993 barkley 's suns lost to jordan 's bulls in the nba finals in 1993 chicago defeated ewing 's knicks in the eastern conference finals in 1994 while jordan was playing baseball the knicks beat the bulls in the conference semifinals and eventually reached the nba finals losing to houston jordan returned late in the 1994 95 season but it was the pacers and not the bulls who beat the knicks in the conference semifinals malone reached the nba finals twice in 1997 and 1998 both times the jazz lost to jordan 's bulls payton was with seattle in 1996 when the sonics lost to chicago in the finals i remember talking with payton at the olympics hill recalled of the 1996 atlanta games they 'd lost to the bulls but they had the same team coming back you could expect them to be in the finals it did n't work out that way a year later seattle failed to go beyond the second round here 's a warning do n't be so quick to crown the lakers as kings you ca n't predict the future hill said i learned that with my ankle anything can happen hill left the pistons in 2000 for orlando he was n't being desperate he was being pragmatic tracy mcgrady was joining the magic that same year after three seasons in toronto the magic was going after tim duncan full force hill would complete the picture duncan remained in san antonio mcgrady blossomed into a star but hill has missed most of three seasons with the ankle injury who could have seen that then that 's the point of course who can anticipate this i was 27 years old at the time hill said i was looking forward to playing with duncan or tracy mcgrady i wanted to be part of helping a franchise get there i felt i had the majority of my career ahead of me now hill now considers himself desperate he comes off crutches wednesday and will put all his weight on the ankle for the first time in a year the quest begins in the last three years i guess you can say i 've developed a sense of urgency hill said i definitely have this same sense of desperation i 'm the oldest player on the roster i was always used to being the youngest now i 'm the oldest i know that when i get back on the court whenever that is this is going to be it you compete to achieve the ultimate and that 's a championship you never know how to figure these things the lakers tried the three star approach in july 1968 when they traded for wilt chamberlain and put him on a team with jerry west who was 30 and elgin baylor who was 34 the three superstars failed to win a championship together then baylor who had been a 10 time all star retired nine games into the 1971 72 season and the lakers went on to win the championship winning as hill knows is capricious in his first two seasons at duke university hill won consecutive national championships he thought that was the way of the world well that was 10 11 years ago he said i want to get back and taste that feeling i want to win everyone does and nearly every player in the history of sports has talked about wanting a championship ring the difference between yesterday and today is that players can afford the luxury of pursuing one
