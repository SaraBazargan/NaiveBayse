 what do the defenestrations of paul h o'neill the treasury secretary and lawrence b lindsey the president 's top economic adviser reveal about the economy now its future and that of the stock market about the economy now the moves show how worried president bush is that the nation will slip back into recession the economy is perceived to be a serious problem said jan hatzius senior economist at goldman sachs you would n't need to change the team if there was n't a problem nor would you change the team if you were n't worried about being re elected in 2004 clearly the white house understands that the economy needs strong medicine if it is to stay on its feet and become ambulatory that medicine administered heretofore and only somewhat successfully by alan greenspan will soon be augmented by new tax cuts if mr bush has his way neither mr o'neill nor mr lindsey had the ideas or the credibility to fix the problems so both had to go many economists agree that tax cuts are exactly what the doctor ordered largely because consumer spending the engine of economic growth in recent years is imperiled by excessive borrowing this economy is really laboring under a tremendous debt load said paul kasriel director of economic research at northern trust in chicago the corporate sector has made great strides in slowing down its borrowing but the private sector has n't even started sure enough debt as a percentage of assets among households has reached new highs consumer borrowing was very strong in the third quarter and equity extraction from homes has been enormous the household net worth figures released last week by the federal reserve showing the latest in a string of declines were also ominous prior to 2000 there had never been a year on year decline in household net worth in the postwar period mr kasriel noted it happened in 2000 and 2001 and now 2002 people are going to have to start saving more but increased saving means reduced spending which would in turn drag down the economy so tax cuts are a way to give consumers the cushion they need to save a bit even as they keep spending the problem for mr bush is that his tax cuts of whatever sort are not likely to be enough to counterbalance increased taxes that most consumers will face from their state and local governments which are struggling mightily and because spending at state and local levels is almost double that of federal spending restraint there could damage the economy significantly if you take all levels of government together it is unlikely that the federal government 's stimulus can outweigh the state and local governments restraint mr hatzius said so even if mr bush succeeds in pushing tax cuts through they may not be that effective in propelling the economy as a result mr hatzius and mr kasriel both expect the economy to sputter along next year mr hatzius projects gross domestic product growth of around 2 percent for 2003 while mr kasriel forecasts around 3 percent so where does that leave the stock market stable perhaps but not strapping sluggish gross domestic product growth usually means corporate profits are n't much better than flat mr hatzius said and if corporate profits stagnate stock indexes may too what has gone on in the past two years may well continue individual stocks do well but the indexes disappoint this economy is in hock mr kasriel said it has come off 20 years of extreme leveraging it 's going to take time to work through these things and it wo n't be pleasant
