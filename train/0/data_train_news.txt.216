 lesa france kennedy started at the bottom of her family business literally as a child one of her duties was to help wipe down the seats at the daytona international speedway before races so that the customers would n't get dirt on their bottoms it was a great proving ground for a young motor sports executive whose job now entails overseeing much of what goes on at the 11 tracks that are a part of the international speedway corporation based in daytona beach fla mrs kennedy 38 is the daughter of bill france jr president of nascar and chairman of international speedway and the granddaughter of bill france sr nascar 's founder her brother brian france is senior vice president of nascar the privately held business that governs stock car racing her upbringing included learning to drive on the daytona straightaways as executive vice president and a member of the board of international speedway mrs kennedy is a top aide to her uncle james france president of the company that makes mrs kennedy not only heir apparent but also one of the highest ranking women in an industry long dominated by men in the high octane high testosterone world of motor sports mrs kennedy is in the fast lane she 's extremely bright has incredible street smarts and her people skills are outstanding said jim hunter president of darlington raceway in darlington sc one of the 11 tracks owned by international speedway she 's definitely opening doors for women in the sport she is also helping the sport overcome raffish regional roots to become viewed as wholesome family entertainment for the nation but mrs kennedy plays down her role as a pace setter for women it 's not my focus she said i do n't spend a lot of time thinking about it besides dealing with existing tracks mrs kennedy is trying to develop tracks in the kansas city chicago and new york areas in new york the frances are working with donald j trump to find a track location most likely on long island or the new jersey meadowlands stock car racing has been growing rapidly and nascar has just negotiated a five year 2 billion television package international speedway bought seven tracks from roger penske in july and added the richmond international raceway in december making the company which is publicly traded the largest motor sports operator in the nation the moves were the boldest since international speedway was founded by bill france sr in 1953 five years after he incorporated nascar as much as mrs kennedy 's parentage furthered her career it was also a burden her biggest challenge has been trying to satisfy her father said mr hunter who has worked for the france family for 30 years anything less than terrific is just not acceptable to him i think that has made it tougher for her than it would for any other woman or man bill france jr he said has given his children every opportunity to get out of the business because he 's made them understand it from the restrooms up that extensive knowledge of the racing business and her attention to detail have won mrs kennedy credibility among her male counterparts nobody doubts her seriousness but she can also poke fun at her family and herself over a recent breakfast at the waldorf astoria a few days before the annual nascar awards banquet susan schandel her chief financial officer joked that running into mrs kennedy in the lobby could mean another chore rather than being able to go shopping mrs kennedy agreed but then reminded her that at times they both slipped away for some shopping mrs kennedy will need all her wit and charm to keep other track owners happy drivers say nascar has already scheduled as many races as they can handle but the other track owners want more races mrs kennedy said that other women in her family had schooled her in nascar 's macho demanding world her grandmother annie b france who operated the ticket office at daytona international speedway for many years encouraged her to pursue a career in the family business during breaks from duke university where she graduated in 1983 with bachelor of arts degrees in economics and psychology mrs kennedy worked in the daytona ticket office and in the complaint department it was great training experience because you were directly in touch with the fans mrs kennedy said you ca n't replace that with research it was problem resolution at the source you could hear their ideas and what they wanted from the sport people would come in and say 'we want to buy a t shirt where 's the gift shop we do n't have one build one and sell the merchandise it 's not quite rocket science but if you listen to the customers you ca n't go wrong that is where mrs kennedy came up with the idea for daytona usa a 20 million 50000 square foot year round entertainment complex at the racing track over the years she pulled together projections on construction costs researched the market and finally convinced her father her uncle and other senior executives that it was worth the risk it opened in 1996 and attracts about 500000 fans a year as assistant manager of the daytona speedway ticket office after she graduated she also pushed to computerize ticket sales at daytona that did n't fall easily on dinosaurs like myself said mr hunter who at the time was a vice president in marketing at nascar convincing us was no easy task because we had always done things the same way for years the big question was why should we change if it works her answers were because it 's cost effective it 's fast it 's efficient after working in the ticket office mrs kennedy moved over to international speedway in 1986 and worked in jobs throughout the company serving as secretary and treasurer before becoming executive vice president in 1996 mrs kennedy is married to dr bruce kennedy a plastic surgeon and has an 8 year old son benjamin she said it 's too early to tell whether benjamin is destined for the family business he 's more of a sports fan she said he 's only in the second grade but he does have several computer racing games
