 sammy sosa fell to the ground and the chicago cubs went with him sunday a fastball from the florida marlins josh beckett tailed toward sosa 's head in the fourth inning of game 4 of the national league championship series sending him sprawling to the dirt and popping up furiously as marlins catcher ivan rodriguez and the home plate umpire began to cool down sosa beckett approached them and took the ball from rodriguez as if he had just plopped down quarters for a newspaper beckett went back to the mound and continued shutting down sosa and the cubs his fastball climbed to 100 miles an hour in that at bat and he finally fooled sosa with a full count changeup to strike him out beckett finished with a two hit shutout tying an nlcs record for a 4 0 victory the cubs lead in the four of seven game series shrank to 3 2 as beckett sent them back to wrigley field in search of their first pennant in 58 years i 'm just used to having the ball in my hand beckett said that 's what i felt like i needed to do i did n't feel like i backed down at all i thought he overreacted to be completely honest with you i thought it was really stupid that we had to go through that sosa did not accuse beckett of throwing intentionally at him but he did blame the events of the previous inning and his own history for his reaction sosa was hit on the helmet twice this season including one scary incident on april 20 when the pittsburgh pirates salomon torres broke his helmet with a pitch that hit sosa 's left ear flap in the third inning sunday the cubs starter carlos zambrano hit the marlins miguel cabrera on the elbow with a pitch because of what happened before maybe that was my reaction sosa said i have nothing against nobody i like to play the game the way it is but when i do n't like something i 'm going to let him know the cubs still maintain the upper hand with mark prior pitching game 6 on tuesday against the marlins carl pavano and if that fails to produce joy in wrigleyville the cubs kerry wood starting game 7 chicago is 5 0 in wood 's and prior 's starts this postseason but the marlins have the cubs history on their side the cubs have not been to the world series since 1945 losing three straight games to the san diego padres in 1984 the last time they were within one victory of getting there not only will the marlins have to get past prior and wood but they will also most likely have to do it without beckett mike lowell ivan rodriguez and jeff conine homered sunday lowell 's two run shot in the fifth breaking a scoreless tie and finally tiring zambrano who was expending physical and emotional energy rapidly zambrano finished each of the first four innings with fist pumps as he walked off the mound beckett who struck out 11 batters allowed only three base runners two singles and a walk none of whom reached second base he took over the game in the fourth sosa who had grounded out in his first at bat dug in against beckett whose first pitch sailed at sosa 's head sosa fell to the ground and as he struggled to his feet he yelled at beckett and gestured with his bat cubs in the dugout leaned on the top step ready in case there was an altercation like the one in the yankees red sox game on saturday but the plate umpire larry poncino quickly stepped in speaking face to face with sosa as rodriguez the marlins catcher tried cooling him down sosa was focused squarely on poncino then and beckett walked in and retrieved the baseball from rodriguez i do n't know what he was trying to do trying to pull a boston red sox yankees thing beckett said i was so surprised i had to shoot something else back at him it was kind of baffling to me really rodriguez said he remembered sosa 's beaning in april and understood his reaction i know he had an accident rodriguez said but in this situation i 'm not trying to hit him it was just a pitch that slipped sosa said he told rodriguez you have to understand i 've been hit pretty good in the head a couple of times and i do n't like that anymore that 's got to stop sosa took a 3 2 changeup that he thought was high and stepped toward first base before poncino called it strike three marlins fans among the crowd of 65279 having overtaken pro player stadium from the noisy cubs fans trailed a muttering sosa to the dugout with howls beckett 23 dominated the san francisco giants in the marlins first postseason game but was outdone by jason schmidt 's three hit shutout beckett pitched poorly in his next game succumbing to the wind at wrigley field in game 1 in what became a wild opener to this series but beckett may be the most talented of the marlins young starters and sunday he dazzled the cubs with fastballs a tightly spun breaking ball that froze hitters and a changeup that seemed to change speeds at will marlins manager jack mckeon had no relievers throwing because i could n't have anybody in the bullpen that had better stuff than he had in the ninth inning sosa was the cubs final batter taking a fastball clocked at 97 mph swinging through another at 95 mph and finally grounding out to short on a changeup to finish 0 for 4 i could n't think of another guy that could have messed that game up more than sammy sosa if he hit a home run there said beckett who swung his arm like a hammer after the final out it was a sigh of relief
