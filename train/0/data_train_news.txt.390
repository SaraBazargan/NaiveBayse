 pete sampras 's decision this week to withdraw from the french open and wimbledon may signal the end of the most remarkable tennis career in the last 30 years but sampras 31 the winner of a record 14 grand slam singles titles is still not ready to say he is retiring he has not competed since september when he captured his 14th major title by defeating andre agassi in the final of the united states open sure we 've talked about it paul annacone his coach said yesterday by telephone he feels like ok andre agassi finals of the us open two year drought 26000 screaming fans it does n't get a whole lot better than that in terms of a resurgence and maybe an overall completion of the picture it 's like michael jordan hitting that last shot years ago against utah in a romantic way everyone says 'walk away it sounds terrific but in reality it remains to be seen we 'll see what not being at wimbledon does to him sampras gave himself some wiggle room for a possible return when he was interviewed by abc television during the lakers spurs playoff game thursday night i am not ready to close the door quite yet on my career he said sampras announced in february that he planned to return to competition this year but he has withdrawn from several tournaments he said this week that it was unlikely he would return for this year 's united states open annacone said sampras had been much more of a part time player in the last six weeks when annacone has focused more on sampras 's business activities than on his game it went to a couple times a week and he probably went one spell where he did n't hit for two to three weeks annacone said since then it 's been once or twice a week a casual 40 minutes just to keep the groove but sampras said he was not burning to prove himself again on the circuit he dominated for much of the 1990 's when i started the process of trying to play wimbledon i found that my heart was n't 100 percent into it he told abc it takes a lot of work and if your heart 's not into it it 's time to move on sampras said he chose not to retire now because he did not want to run the risk of changing his mind i do n't think he 'll pull a jordan or a lemieux patrick mcenroe the united states davis cup captain said yesterday by telephone that 's not his personality he 's stubborn in a way very thoughtful about the decisions he makes he 's very attuned to his place in tennis history and he 's not going to play if he does n't feel he can win and he wants to make sure that when he says he 's stopping he is really done annacone said sampras was adamant that the birth of his first child in november was not influencing his thinking about continuing his career it 's not 'i need to be home i have to be with my child annacone said it 's about 'am i ready to do this seven days a week with that focus that discipline that sacrifice annacone thinks this layoff just may generate its own challenge in the modern game no established star has won major titles after a long break maybe that will be intriguing to him he said
