 all signs pointed to a return to cleveland that is where manny ramirez had played the outfield for eight seasons and that is where those who knew him said he wanted to continue playing but ramirez decided tonight to change playing sites and agreed to play for the boston red sox his price was 160 million for eight years a person familiar with the agreement said in the space of several hours today major league baseball which had never had a player earn 20 million a year suddenly had two earlier alex rodriguez agreed to a 10 year 252 million offer from the texas rangers the red sox are expected to announce their newest acquisition in boston on tuesday by snaring ramirez the red sox completed an arduous effort that their executives intensified last week by spending two days in the office of ramirez 's agent jeff moorad but when they left newport beach calif without a deal the red sox appeared to be on their way to being losers once again two years ago they tried to snatch bernie williams from the yankees as a free agent only to drive up the price for the yankees who retained him by making a huge jump in their offer the indians did not play the yankees game today they tried to lure ramirez back to the fold back to the comfort of jacobs field but they were not prepared to meet boston 's offer the red sox went beyond the price they wanted to pay 144 million for eight years or 18 million a year but they were determined to make a dramatic move at times during the negotiations with the red sox and the indians moorad seemed to be taking a chance that he would price ramirez out of the market as he repeatedly said no to both teams but as kevin appier the pitcher who signed with the mets today said no was a very powerful word he referred to his own negotiations but his remark applied here as well ramirez batted 351 hit 38 home runs and drove in 122 runs in only 118 games last season in the previous two seasons he drove in 310 runs and hit 89 home runs he is considered perhaps the most lethal run producer in the major leagues
