 just as it is about to begin the 2000 census has had a little glitch the census bureau this week began mailing 120 million letters one to every household in the country notifying residents of the impending census questionnaire the only problem is that each and every address is wrong the mistake first reported in today 's issue of the washington post occurred when a commercial printer hired by the government printing office inadvertently included an extra digit at the beginning of every street address kenneth prewitt the director of the census bureau called the mistake unfortunate but added that the united states postal service had assured the bureau that it would still be able to deliver the letters because computerized mail sorters rely on bar codes not on written addresses the letters which are to begin arriving on march 1 are part of a campaign by the bureau to maximize participation in this year 's census the error which mr prewitt said is not uncommon in mass mailings resulted from a software problem with the printer which mr prewitt declined to identify since the printer sent the letters directly to the postal service for delivery no one at the bureau caught the error he said the mistake will add a number between 1 and 4 to the street number of any address in an interview mr prewitt said that 80 percent of the addresses essentially all those with conventional addresses will have an extra 1 so the letter addressed to resident at 1600 pennsylvania avenue will show up as 11600 pennsylvania avenue a postal worker in new england noticed the error on tuesday and notified the postal service which pointed it out to the bureau it 's absolutely regrettable mr prewitt said on the other hand i can completely assure you that this has no consequences for the operation of the census it wo n't affect who is counted correction february 28 2000 monday an article about erroneous addresses on census bureau letters to 120 million households was omitted from some copies of the late edition on saturday although it was listed in the contents on page a1 the article is reprinted today on page a15
