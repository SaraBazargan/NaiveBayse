 officers of the consulting firm at kearney have selected hl henner klein a vice president based in brussels as their new chief executive mr klein whose election is expected to be announced today will have to wrestle with the problem of running a firm that wants to be an independent strategic consulting business but is a subsidiary of a huge public corporation the 138000 employee eds which bought at kearney in 1995 our first priority is that at kearney wants to be the trusted adviser and has to be neutral and has to do what is in the interest of its client mr klein said in a telephone interview from the firm 's office in brussels on friday the same challenge confronted mr klein 's predecessor dietmar ostermann whose three year term expires at the end of november mr klein 's term begins dec 1 mr ostermann was pressed by richard h brown then the chief executive of eds to make at kearney much more a component of its parent corporation and to run it more like a company than like a partnership one result was the withholding of bonuses to kearney 's officers the equivalent of its partners as a result of the failure of the firm to meet eds sales goals for all three years of mr ostermann 's tenure that was bad for morale several kearney officers left the firm in that period kearney now employs slightly more than 4000 people what does not work and what i think was the wrong strategic direction is to set up at kearney as a line of business integrated into eds mr klein said that approach he said eroded the perceived independence that is critical to consultants at kearney which sells management and technology advisory services in contrast eds an information technology company is a major player in the business of operating computer operations for other companies mr klein said that michael h jordan eds 's new chief executive and a former mckinsey company consultant had a good understanding of the importance of autonomy to kearney the problem for kearney consultants as employees of eds arises clearly when recommending products or services to clients said tom rodenhauser president of consulting information services a company in keene nh that tracks the consulting industry consultants generally say they want to recommend the most appropriate products regardless of who sells them as employees of eds though they also have an incentive to sell products and services of their parent company the tricky part that kearney 's going to have to deal with is what is really independence under the eds umbrella mr rodenhauser said complicating at kearney 's efforts to assert an appropriate degree of autonomy has been the uncertain economy which has also led eds to announce at least 2700 layoffs mr klein expressed some optimism that conditions would improve initially in the united states and that demand for the kind of high level strategic advice that at kearney offers would increase i believe we will have modest single digit growth probably as of next year he said mr klein is something of a throwback for kearney he joined the firm in 1982 before the acquisition by eds and his election sends a message that the firm is trying to return to those days of greater independence mr rodenhauser said dietmar ostermann was a partner after the acquisition mr rodenhauser said mr klein he continued represents the old kearney just how independent at kearney will be will depend on details that have probably not yet been worked out between the firm and eds mr rodenhauser said on paper the governance structure at kearney which is based in chicago is relatively simple mr klein will belong to a board of which mr jordan the eds chief will be chairman other directors will be eds executives or representatives elected by at kearney officers or chosen by mr klein but much will depend on how active the board is mr rodenhauser said they are still working that out he said
