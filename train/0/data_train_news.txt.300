 the most exciting aspect of the 2001 2 nba season will be the race for second place barring injury internal discord or a miracle the los angeles lakers will win their third straight championship next june but who earns the right to be the lakers fodder in the finals will be the real story and provide the real drama before he returned to sacramento without seriously considering other teams chris webber should have thought about this if you do n't share a locker room with shaquille o'neal and kobe bryant the eastern conference is the place to be no fewer than seven teams philadelphia milwaukee toronto orlando charlotte miami and the knicks can enter training camp in october with a realistic chance of winning the conference crown i see one legitimate team in this league that looks dominant and that 's the lakers miami coach pat riley said anybody else that begins to sing their own song about dominance failed to look at the playoffs and see the fact that one shot here or there could have changed the fortunes of three or four other teams there 's so much parity and equality there are favorites in the east however the two conference finalists philadelphia and milwaukee have to be placed atop the mix and if the bucks are able to pull off a sign and trade with miami for anthony mason they will be downright scary even so the real powers may be toronto and orlando after maneuvering to get hakeem olajuwon in what for them was a painless sign and trade with houston on paper the raptors are arguably the conference 's best squad and orlando will welcome back grant hill who missed all but four games last season with an ankle injury while adding patrick ewing and horace grant toronto appears to be the most imposing it has the superstar scorer in vince carter the rugged yet skilled power forward in antonio davis outside shooting in alvin williams and morris peterson doggedness in chris childs athletic frontcourt play off the bench in jerome williams and keon clark and now one of the top five or six centers in the league though he is 38 olajuwon could be a force in the east if he remains healthy he has been limited to half seasons the past four years because of injuries and last season nearly had his career ended by a blood clot but after his health was restored olajuwon averaged an impressive 15 points and 9 rebounds over his last 23 games and that was in the rugged west olajuwon who was also being courted by indiana and the knicks now says he has been rejuvenated by his move to toronto it 's going to be fun playing with vince olajuwon said in a conference call thursday night it 's like college and phi slamma jamma we 're going to dunk on people it 's like i 'm a rookie again i 'm excited it raises my curiosity to another level ewing who turns 39 today does not have as much left as olajuwon but he should also be more effective in the east than he was last season in seattle if ewing can stay healthy and provide a respectable post presence on both ends of the floor the magic 's perimeter of hill tracy mcgrady and darrell armstrong should be enough to make it formidable orlando coach doc rivers 's greatest challenge might be getting hill and mcgrady to play well together their games are strikingly similar it will take some time and i know that because they have n't played together rivers said the only thing that 's holding this team back is that all the best parts have n't played together usually it takes time a couple seasons actually but i 'm too impatient for that to happen we have to try and shorten that curve the best part with both of them is that they 're willing passers they do n't mind setting each other up rivers admitted to being unsure of how big a role ewing would play in the regular season but he believes he could be a factor in the playoffs he 's not going to be the patrick ewing that i played with or the patrick ewing that most of the fans remember but he 's still better than half the centers in the nba rivers said he 's a guy who i 'm not sure yet how we 'll use him for us to make it through the playoffs he needs to be strong fresh and healthy part of my job will be to manage the minutes so that can take place if patrick gives us not one quality second on the court he 'll still help the team because his work ethic can rub off on our young guys elsewhere charlotte is hoping to build on its best postseason performance ever the knicks are looking for redemption from first round failure and miami is planning to change its style of play after the heat was swept in the first round by speedier more athletic charlotte riley decided to move away from the plodding bruising style he has espoused since taking over the knicks in 1991 he believes his young perimeter players anthony carter eddie house and ricky davis who will join alonzo mourning brian grant and eddie jones to form the heat 's nucleus will be better in a fast paced game we 'll change our style of play to really enhance the athleticism and enthusiasm of some of these guys riley said i want to get younger more athletic more energy less scars and wounds and hangovers sprewell must accept role marcus camby has spent much of the off season working out and hanging out with latrell sprewell when asked if the popular belief that sprewell was tired of playing with allan houston was true camby answered with a quick not at all but he went on to say that sprewell was tired of playing the small forward or 3 spot from what i 've seen spree 's not upset or anything with allan camby said his biggest thing right now is that he wants to play 2 he feels that 's his natural position he feels he has to guard bigger players every night he 's getting posted up but he does n't say anything he just goes out there and plays the 3 but he definitely wants to play the 2 the 6 foot 5 190 pound sprewell who is currently in milwaukee and could not be reached for comment voiced displeasure with his position last march after being torched for 30 points by the 6 9 shareef abdur rahim in a loss to vancouver he said his inability to guard taller forwards was forcing his teammates to double team too much there is really no answer to sprewell 's plight other than a trade and he does not dislike playing out of position enough to leave new york instead he had better get used to it because houston 's new six year 100 million contract makes him virtually untradeable the fact of the matter is that if sprewell is going to be a knick he is going to be a 3 camby spokesman with kids marcus camby has been named national spokesman for the league 's welcome back to school initiative which will kick off the coming school year the league was so impressed with camby 's annual march with marcus in which camby walks several hundred students to school on the first day of classes that it borrowed the idea and plans to have similar opening day events in every nba city
