 new year 's day has the reputation for renewal for being the time when we take stock and set goals and cast off bad habits and worn out socks but thinking people know that the true moment for such stuff is now when summer gives way to fall the three month vacation mind set is reluctantly jettisoned a collective deep breath is taken and we all regird our loins figuratively speaking except for those of us who play football for a living that is what we hope to do in this column regird that is not play football we hope to a tie up a loose end b set our sights on new mysteries that need conquering and c offer nominations for things that should be thrown out along with those old socks in the loose ends department we offer one last look at the great 20 giveaway in june you 'll recall we spread five 20 bills around and asked the finders to tell us how they spent the money then last month we harshly indeed rudely scolded the entire state because none of the finders had played along this caused two things to happen 1 several smart alecks we know suggested rightly that the only numbskull in the story was the one who had frittered away 100 2 amy ryan sent us a letter ms ryan who now lives in north carolina but until a few weeks ago lived in princeton junction confessed to finding the 20 we had left at the plainsboro public library she would have written sooner she said but well there was the small chore of moving she said the column containing our scolding had shamed her into finally telling her tale which turns out to have an astonishing twist my daughter bailey 7 and i read about the hunt early that saturday morning and just as we were getting ready to leave for plainsboro bailey 's grandfather frank ryan from whiting called to let us know about it too she wrote we ran right in as the doors opened and found the book and the bill after a bit of fevered hunting here 's the eerie part in delivering our scolding we had suggested that a good place to send found money was the popcorn park zoo which takes in abused animals the ryans incredibly reported that they had already given the 20 to the zoo even before reading that advice our head has been spinning at this coincidence ever since which ends the 20 giveaway tale and leads into part two of today 's column shocking and unexplained things that we think someone perhaps even us should investigate now that vacation season is over 1 a few days ago we came home to find a message on the answering machine from a worker at newark airport he advised that the turtles we had just picked up at the airport had not been cleared by government inspectors and should immediately be brought back we 're fairly sure this man dialed our number by mistake since we ca n't recall picking up any turtles at the airport and that 's the kind of thing we generally remember questions have been nagging us ever since is whoever did pick up the turtles still walking around with them endangering the public in untold ways who inspects turtles and for what why did n't the caller from the airport leave a number 2 on the northeast corridor rail line near linden a half dozen tracks run parallel someone has discarded a rather bulky typewriter there not on the edge of the track bed where most litter lives but between tracks four and five every time we zip by this typewriter we want to know more did someone really tiptoe across several live train tracks to deposit it there did a frustrated writer heave it out the window of a train if so how since train windows do n't open 3 recently we got a call asking if we would participate in a french fry taste test this was serious business and we had to sign a confidentiality agreement which is why you will not read whose fries were being tested but we will reveal that the testers asked were the fries too potatoey not potatoey enough or just right we were astounded who knew there were degrees of potatoeyness are there also degrees of tomatoeyness and carrotyness so we have plenty to ponder as we exit summer and wade back into the workaday world to free up brain cells for this pondering we have vowed to devote no more mental energy to a dozen or so worn out subjects these among them cell phone etiquette survivors those fiberglass cows the frisking photograph the weather we suggest you make a similar list as part of your regirding process and you with the turtles turn yourself in you know who you are
