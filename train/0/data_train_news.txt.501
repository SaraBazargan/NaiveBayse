 i wonder when americans will get tired of being told what to do and think tina brown wrote in her most recent column for the times of london luckily for ms brown the former editor of talk the new yorker and vanity fair that moment has apparently not arrived yet her new talk show topic a which had its premiere last night on cnbc is all about telling americans what to do and think the british ms brown who in her heyday was as famous as a hostess as she was as a writer and editor seeks tips from her guests in quick bursts of cocktail party chatter a happy hour at the end of cnbc 's long dismal day of stock prices and bulletins from the federal reserve how much juice is there in this trend she asked the media mogul barry diller referring to the influence of the fox news channel on the other cable news networks you mean are we going full right mr diller the chairman and chief executive of usa interactive who might be making a play for the entertainment assets of vivendi universal replied 'god i hope not oxford educated and quick witted ms brown is new to television and her inexperience showed in a breezy off handed way of speaking that at times teetered on the brink of call your congressman poor taste at one point ms brown noted with a smile that when tainted corporations like enron are exposed they vaporize like baghdad buildings the hourlong program which is expected to run only once a quarter represents a fresh start for ms brown a humble return to the new york media world after talk magazine folded in january 2002 her chosen topics for last night 's program suggested that she has not quite gotten over the humiliation she experienced over the first failure of her glittering career she asked mr diller why so many people lost their judgment in the 1990 's was it greed or just social pressure but it was not entirely clear whether she was referring to dot com investors or herself ms brown left the new yorker in 1998 to start a magazine with harvey weinstein the miramax studio co founder so she could as she put it in an interview last year join the entrepreneurial age the premiere party she threw on liberty island for 1400 of the world 's most famous faces madonna henry a kissinger salman rushdie defined the bravado and self indulgence of the decade the guest list for her maiden show last night read a little like a round up of that party in the page six gossip column in the new york post along with mr diller she spoke to conrad black the conservative british newspaper tycoon sir howard stringer chief executive of the sony corporation of america malcolm gladwell the writer simon schama the historian and queen noor of jordan the american born widow of king hussein who has a best selling autobiography leap of faith ms brown was unable to pierce queen noor 's armor of muslim solidarity but did make her squirm a little by asking about her official trips to saddam hussein 's iraq the queen said she had lunch with his wife but did not meet mr hussein himself pairing her guests ms brown posed some amusing questions but at other times the conversation was reminiscent of dinner parties with the high and mighty during which the hostess asks the powerful man to her left a fawning question who is the barry diller of the democratic party and he preens and gives a boring long winded answer that ends with a dodge i like a lot of them in a television talk show world dominated by healers like oprah winfrey and dr phil though ms brown provided a refreshing change of milieu more urbane than suburban jolting the status quo has long been her trademark first at vanity fair and later at the new yorker ms brown brought a frisson of television 's immediacy and glibness to magazine journalism whether she can infect television with a little of the printed word 's reflection and sophistication could be a challenge as she said on the today show yesterday morning in television you have to have kind of a combination of add attention deficit disorder and intense focus all at the same time
