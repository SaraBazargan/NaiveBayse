 at halftime of the nets game against the detroit pistons on thursday night jamie feick was sitting in the locker room when the first half statistics were passed around he had 19 rebounds the nets began to urge their teammate on yelling for him to go for 30 or 40 boards and perhaps etch his name into the record book for feick the 19 rebounds meant something else it assured him that he would be on the floor for the second half feick whose minutes have gone up and down like a roller coaster recently wanted to play and help his team to win when the game was over he had 25 rebounds including the final one of the night when he grabbed a missed shot by pistons guard lindsey hunter to secure the nets 122 120 victory after playing only eight minutes against the knicks the previous night feick had accomplished his mission and earned a start on saturday afternoon when the nets play host to the dallas mavericks i try not to get caught up in it feick said after practice today at the champion center people were saying 'come on get 30 or 40 the main thing was to win the game and that 's what we did the 25 rebounds were the third highest total in nets history buck williams holds the record with 27 although that occurred during a four overtime game on the season feick ranks fifth in the national basketball association with 117 rebounds a game finding his name among such players as shaquille o'neal dikembe mutombo tim duncan and kevin garnett in offensive rebounds feick ranks third behind chicago 's elton brand and o'neal but feick remains an afterthought in the league a player who is more often than not referred to by name the pistons alvin gentry did just that after the game when he said that one guy outrebounded our entire team in the first half feick said i think i 'm kind of a dark horse i like that i like to maybe sneak up and come out of nowhere people do n't expect a lot from me i like that that would be a good name for me dark horse while feick may enjoy his lack of status among the opposition he is not quite so happy when his own coaches think of him that way despite his numbers his minutes have soared up and down nets coach don casey played jim mcilvaine against patrick ewing on wednesday and the coach attributes the fluctuations in feick 's minutes to the nets depth of big men but feick also endured a 23 minute four rebound night on monday against the philadelphia 76ers after averaging 30 minutes and 127 rebounds a game in the three games before that even after signing a seven year deal with the nets this summer the not too distant memory of trying to stick through a 10 day contract keeps him wishing for more stability we just feel that we 'll still be manning the center by committee casey said the way he came off last night 's game was important if someone is too big for him the reaction ca n't be 'what 's going on patrick ewing has not player in the last quarter of three games that 's what the league is evolving into feick said sometimes coach does things for matchup purposes maybe he did n't feel i was the best person for our team in the game at that time it 's frustrating because you want to be part of the action all the time the only thing i can control is when he does put me in to play as hard as i can play feick would like more recognition around the league and sees the national basketball association 's sixth man award as a way out of the darkness eventually i would like to come out of the dark horse stereotype feick said i like being the dark horse people do n't expect as much from you and maybe there 's less pressure rebounds sherman douglas underwent surgery friday to repair a lesion on his left ankle he will have to stay off the ankle six to eight weeks and then begin rehabilitation the nets activated gheorghe muresan on friday and placed michael cage on the injured list with a sprained toe muresan who had torn cartilage in his knee surgically repaired on dec 15 participated in light drills friday and was not expected to be ready to play just yet we 're going to take gheorghe on the road trip to work him out casey said he got clearance to work out i wo n't say with restrictions but with monitoring
