 the enduring memory of this resurgent penn state season is not elation over four victories but wrath over the lone defeat upset about two calls made in an overtime loss at home to iowa joe paterno chased and grabbed referee dick honig first in a dyspeptic trot then in an incensed sprint his anger seeming to build with his speed i never realized people had a stopwatch every time i chased an official paterno said joking the other day some have found his reaction jarring even excessive for a man whose reputation remains sterling in an increasingly tarnished sport for a coach who leads major colleges in career victories and tops the big ten conference in the graduation rate of his players others have marveled at the swiftness of a guy two and a half months shy of his 76th birthday his players have taken this incensed gallop as affirmation of paterno 's enduring passion in his 37th season as head coach while he has come to represent the larger threatened virtues of dignity and character paterno remains behind his thick glasses and thin patience a coach with a voracious appetite for winning and a heartburn 's irritability over losing he 's into the game just as much as we are anthony adams a senior defensive tackle said some measure of vindication was granted paterno when two members of the officiating crew that worked the iowa game on sept 28 were later suspended by the big ten i was n't surprised he said nor is he astonished at the turnaround his team has made winning 9 of its last 12 games after starting 0 4 last season climbing from unaccustomed despair into the lower reaches of the top 25 if others stopped believing he never did while fans and pundits questioned whether paterno was over the hill resistant to change he remained confident resolved resourceful it shows he 's got resiliency and he knows the game it proves a lot of things that people have been saying about him were wrong jay paterno joe 's son and coach of penn state 's quarterbacks said i 'm sure he heard those things that the game had passed him by he took it as a challenge he thrives on that penn state which is no 11 in the new york times computer ranking can make another impressive stitch in its repaired glory with a victory at michigan on saturday it will not come easily the wolverines have won five straight games in this rivalry the nittany lions inventive offense has been imperiled by a sprained throwing shoulder of quarterback zack mills and a hamstring strain for tailback larry johnson and the defense has played erratically surrendering 66 points in two conference games this is the biggest game i 've played in and the biggest game for the program in a couple of years mills a redshirt sophomore said one or two games is not going to bring back penn state football and make everyone happy we have to continue to play well and win in order for that to happen the previous two years lapsed into the first consecutive losing seasons under paterno he admitted in august that he may have let some small things slip not objecting enough to things he did not like not scurrying often enough from drill to drill in practice not growing as certain as he should have been about a particular lineup if you 're the head coach you have to have your stamp he said his stamp is decidedly on this team when the starting cornerback richard gardner and punter dave royer were three minutes late for a team bus the night before a game against louisiana tech paterno benched them for the first half defensive linemen said he was again running over to them in practice furious over small mistakes that others had not seen he has even demonstrated the intricacies of the center snap in the shotgun formation he 's not letting anything slide adams said yet at 75 paterno remains flexible open to suggestion last saturday he let place kicker robbie gould talk him into a 51 yard field goal attempt that provided the thin margin in a 34 31 victory at wisconsin penn state 's offense once derided as antique for its predictable muscle has blossomed like some exotic flower with the shotgun the sprint option and multiple receivers who stretch a defense like taffy rather than let rust the plentiful skills of michael robinson a redshirt freshman quarterback paterno has used him as a split end and running back robinson scored 5 touchdowns the first 10 times he touched the ball and paterno has scrapped a committee approach at tailback settling on johnson last season penn state rushed for a meager 1317 yards the lowest in the paterno era this season the spread offense has facilitated the run and the nittany lions are averaging 100 yards more a game on the ground a reinvigorated johnson leads the big ten and is second in the nation with 1852 all purpose yards a game a coach who has been around that long been so successful you 'd think might be kind of stuck in his ways said mills who set a school record with 399 passing yards against iowa give him credit for opening up he is not reinventing himself only adapting to his personnel paterno insists as far back as 1959 when he coached the penn state quarterbacks the nittany lions played a run and gun offense with a double wing and the option he reminded reporters his 1994 team went undefeated with the productive throwing of kerry collins often scoring with the speed of microwave popcorn i got trapped in my own joke about being conservative he said in an interview asked if he felt redeemed this season or whether he was amused or angered that people questioned his ability a year ago paterno said he did not coach to gain approval from others the game is the thing he said i enjoy saturdays and preparing for saturdays what the fans think whether they think i 'm over the hill i do n't pay attention to the fact that some people think i 'm great and i do n't pay attention to the fact that some people think i 'm a bum you do that you go nuts penn state is winning again and paterno said he might sign a new five year contract his most delicate job is planning for succession without signaling that he is ready to leave what else would he do but coach he has often said he does not fish or play golf and the only way he knows to start the lawn mower is to scream for his wife sue he 's got 11 grandchildren all under the age of 8 jay paterno said with a laugh i think he 's scared to death being home with all of them at one time that 's what 's driving him that and an unsated desire to win on saturday afternoons at wisconsin the policeman who escorts the officials told me he was working on his sprints all week to defend against joe jay paterno said
