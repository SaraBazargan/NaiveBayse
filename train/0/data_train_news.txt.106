 responding to a radio host 's lament that the constitution barred him from running for a third term president clinton said today that americans should vote for the next best thing by electing vice president al gore on tuesday mr clinton 's comments on a radio show broadcast hours before he arrived here for the first of several rallies aimed at persuading blacks and hispanics to vote underscored the tense nature of the relationship between the president and mr gore whose campaign has resisted using mr clinton more extensively for fear he would steal the limelight at a moment when mr gore is reciting daily that he is running as my own man late this afternoon mr clinton made a case for mr gore before a muted crowd in the predominantly black baldwin hills neighborhood in south los angeles mr clinton devoted much of his talk to a description of the successes of his own administration arguing that he had made people in watts feel they have as much say in the white house as my friends in beverly hills from there mr clinton went to visit those wealthy friends at a series of fund raisers the gore campaign has restricted mr clinton 's appearances keeping battleground states off limits for fear that the president 's arrival could alienate moderate undecided voters who are leery of casting a vote that is likely to be read as a referendum on mr clinton 's presidency that plan however has been under negotiation between the white house and the gore campaign all week and mr clinton 's precise schedule is still in flux last week the gore campaign was taken aback by the release of an interview mr clinton gave to esquire magazine in which he said republicans should apologize to the nation for impeaching him the white house said that mr clinton thought the interview would not be released until after the election there is no question that the president is far more popular among minority voters than mr gore and his appearance today on the tom joyner morning show broadcast nationwide on the abc radio networks was part of a strategy to spur a large democratic turnout for a candidate who many minority voters say leaves them cold during the interview mr joyner whose show is particularly popular among urban black audiences lamented that mr clinton could not run for a third term it would be nice if we could get four more years from you it 's been a good eight years for us mr joyner said mr clinton quickly responded but you can get the next best thing i 'll tell you we 've got to win this election and i feel very strongly that we 're going to win it if our folks vote the president has been careful not to publicly criticize the gore campaign for what he clearly views as underusing his skills on the stump his friends and colleagues however say mr clinton is ready to do a last minute battleground swing that might force the bush campaign to pour more resources into states mr clinton visits mr clinton acknowledged today that the race is virtually tied though he did not say in public what some associates say he has said in private that with the economy this good mr gore should be far ahead all these polls that show it close and show governor bush a point or two ahead all those polls are premised on an assumption that african american and hispanic voters and first generation immigrants will not vote in the same percentages that the republican base will vote mr clinton said the rally today at baldwin hills was something of an oddity mr clinton has rarely appeared at a campaign event this year that did not carry a high entry fee for the participants the event took place in a relatively new mall that was built partly by magic johnson the retired basketball star who was supposed to join mr clinton but did not appear mr clinton told the crowd of 1000 to 2000 people that mr gore understands the future how it will be shaped by the internet and the global economy but the applause was hardly spirited even when mr clinton mocked the math behind gov george w bush 's plans for spending the government surplus and one of the primary arguments mr clinton made for his vice president was somewhat negative someone has to be there if this crowd stays in control of congress he said of the republicans to stop their extremist action
