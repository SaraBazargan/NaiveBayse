 my mother was recently pulled over by a police officer for making an illegal turn he asked to see her driver 's license and then leaned his head in her car window listen jean the officer said to her ca n't you read signs my mother who is of a certain age and generally has the utmost respect for the law responded severely young man she said you do n't know me well enough to call me by my first name well at least i know where i got it from the first time i met with unwelcome familiarity was when my daughter was a small child and had a 6 year old playmate in the backyard caroline an adorable little redhead suddenly called to me from the backyard hey she shouted hey you after i determined that the child was speaking to me i gently admonished her caroline i said please call me by my name i am mrs lombardi a few minutes later she tried again hey hey kate i have always felt like a bit of a curmudgeon on this subject and certainly out of step with the times the majority of my friends prefer to be called by their first names by children who are not their own they say to be referred to as mrs or even ms makes them feel old or even gasp like their mothers one friend said she always looks over her shoulder to check for her mother in law when someone calls her mrs cohen well call me old fashioned but it warms my heart when someone steps out of my car and says thanks very much for the ride mrs lombardi i feel a rush of affection for the child who calls the house and says hello mrs lombardi this is evan may i speak to paul please conversely i get profoundly irritated when the voice on the phone grunts hey paul there i will not even get started on children who walk into my house and open the refrigerator and start browsing its contents or who pick up my telephone and dial whomever they please when i was a child i was given a book called white gloves and party manners this proved to be a treasure trove of useful information ranging from telephone to table manners there was even a special chapter on complicated foods which offered specific instructions on tackling artichokes and lobster another chapter was devoted to meetings greetings and goodbyes my favorite was the last line in that chapter which read and should you ever meet a king or queen you say 'how do you do your majesty though this occasion has yet to arise many of the other etiquette lessons that my parents hammered into me repeatedly have come up daily thank you please napkin in your lap elbows off the table look someone in the eye when you shake her hand i would n't have dreamed of calling any of my parents friends by their first names very close friends were called aunt and uncle the rest remain mr and mrs or dr to this day in turn i hound my own children with these lessons but this being westchester that which you are not willing to do yourself can be purchased in a county where you can hire someone to teach your child to ride a bike so too can you enroll them in manners school instead of sitting at the dinner table with your own offspring reminding them not to interrupt their father to sit up straight and to stop that disgusting slurping you can sign them up for manners for children the etiquette advantage taught by nancy williams and betty hoover that 's mrs williams and mrs hoover to you this new rochelle based course goes over the same material that most parents once did they 've taught their class which covers everything from correct handshakes and introductions to dining room etiquette do not chew gum at the table do not put it on your salad plate excuse yourself to remove the gum are a few tips at all manner of public private and religious schools private groups and birthdays can be arranged and brownie scouts can take the class for their manners merit badge this year i 'm thinking of sending a gift certificate of tuition to a certain child i know who opened a carefully selected gift from me on christmas and upon holding the blouse up said my god i would never wear anything this color i would n't expect a thank you note
