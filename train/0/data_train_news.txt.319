 bobby holik who has missed eight consecutive games with a strained hip flexor went through a full practice today and expressed optimism that he could return to the rangers lineup against the calgary flames on thursday night but holik the rangers key free agent acquisition last summer expressed a major caveat regarding his injured hip i do n't think it will be what it was before until the summer that is it will not be fully healed until he can give it a full summer of rest that is not good news for the rangers who lured holik 31 across the hudson river after a decade with the devils with a five year 45 million contract right now i 've got to get to the point where it 's not going to get any worse by playing said holik who has long been regarded by many as the best two way center in the nhl but i do n't think this will completely go away this season i 'm looking to get to the point where i wo n't feel worse some days it might be worse than others i want to get it to where i wo n't feel restricted by it the rangers 7 9 2 0 have won three of four games since ending a three game losing streak against calgary 5 5 3 3 they will be without coach bryan trottier who will sit out the final game of a two game suspension holik 's injury stems from the last preseason game on oct 5 holik nearly broke his right foot when he was hit by a slap shot as he was going to the net x rays were negative holik said today he began to feel his lower back troubling him during the season opener at carolina on oct 9 i tried to play through it said holik who added that he began to favor his right foot when he skated which led to the hip problem you overcompensate for it and eventually you get to the point where you strain it in 10 games holik has one goal and one assist and an uncharacteristic plus minus rating of minus 4 what holik wants now is to get back to the point where he feels he can play without hurting the team that is looking more like thursday night i do n't think i 'm at the stage in my career where i can play eight minutes and be effective holik said holik was encouraged that he was able to go through a full practice this afternoon two days after he participated in the morning skate in san jose calif i thought i had a good practice said holik who filled in on a line with rem murray and pavel bure in eric lindros 's usual spot lindros had stayed at the team hotel because of the flu the rangers said i 'm close to playing holik said but if i feel i 'm not quite ready i do n't want to take the spot of somebody who is 100 percent with almost 80 percent of their season ahead of them however the rangers have to be worried that holik does not think he will be 100 percent until next season
