 the knicks and the denver nuggets are discussing a trade that would feature marcus camby and nuggets point guard nick van exel as the key components according to a person with knowledge of denver 's negotiations no offers have been made but the teams are discussing two scenarios the first would send camby and guard mark jackson to denver for van exel and james posey an athletic 6 foot 8 swingman the other would bring van exel and the versatile 6 foot 11 raef lafrentz to new york for camby jackson another player perhaps center travis knight or center felton spencer might have to be thrown in to make it work under the rules of the league 's collective bargaining agreement the knicks are believed to prefer the second deal while the nuggets favor the first scott layden the knicks general manager could not be reached for comment with the feb 21 trade deadline approaching the nuggets are mulling over several potential deals for van exel the talented but disgruntled point guard who has asked to be traded three teams the knicks the minnesota timberwolves and the toronto raptors appear to be the most aggressive suitors the most likely trade at this point is believed to be van exel to minnesota for timberwolves point guard terrell brandon denver 's general manager kiki vandeweghe believes brandon and antonio mcdyess the nuggets all star forward would work well together the nuggets have also talked with toronto about trading van exel for forward jerome williams and point guard chris childs the former knick but toronto general manager glen grunwald said yesterday that he did not foresee a deal we 've talked to denver grunwald said but i do n't think we have anything going with them it seems unlikely that the knicks who play tonight at orlando would trade camby a 6 11 forward and jackson for van exel and posey because they would not be receiving a big man in return they would perhaps want to replace posey in the deal with the 6 10 center scott williams but the other scenario might be too lopsided in the knicks favor jackson could not come close to replacing the scoring and speed of van exel and while camby has done more in the league than lafrentz his history of injury makes him undependable he is currently out for the rest of the month with a bruise and torn muscle in his right hip if the knicks obtain van exel without giving up either of their perimeter stars latrell sprewell and allan houston they will almost certainly begin playing a different style they will be a near mirror image of the milwaukee bucks one of the eastern conference favorites and the current leaders of the central division van exel houston and sprewell all average more than 18 points a game and would be every bit as good as milwaukee 's big three of sam cassell ray allen and glenn robinson even without camby the knicks frontcourt of kurt thomas clarence weatherspoon and othella harrington would be nearly as strong as milwaukee 's if the knicks obtained lafrentz the league 's second leading shot blocker it might be even better lafrentz averages 14 points 7 rebounds and 3 blocked shots a game he is a solid position defender inside as opposed to camby who blocks shots while coming over from the weak side lafrentz who is in his fourth season is also the nuggets second leading 3 point shooter behind van exel a trade involving van exel and camby would be the boldest move of layden 's 10 year career as a general manager in utah and new york and would perhaps show how pressured he feels by the freefall of the knicks 19 28 though he is only in the third year of a seven year deal worth 15 million to 20 million layden may need to pull off something big to save his job past this season while the knicks would have interest in obtaining charles oakley if he is waived by chicago their chances of landing him might be slim oakley would certainly want to play for a playoff bound team and his friendship with michael jordan would make the resurgent washington wizards a more likely candidate orlando would also have interest in oakley and with his former knicks teammates doc rivers and patrick ewing in orlando the magic would have a strong shot as well
