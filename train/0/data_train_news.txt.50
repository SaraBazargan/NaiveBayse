 for this day at least there was no acrimony no angry fans no critical news media patrick ewing 's retirement after 17 mostly distinguished seasons as a pro basketball player turned into a lovefest there was ewing sitting at a table at a midtown hotel it 's a lot easier for me to sit because i do n't want to hurt my back announcing that he was retiring and disclosing that he would become an assistant coach for the washington wizards standing along the walls were former knicks teammates and rivals charles oakley allan houston mark jackson charlie ward herb williams alonzo mourning and kenny smith among those in the audience were mike jarvis who coached ewing at rindge and latin high school in cambridge mass and who now coaches at st john 's jeff van gundy the knicks coach during ewing 's final years in new york and don chaney the current knicks coach in his 15 seasons with the knicks followed by single seasons with the seattle supersonics and the orlando magic ewing a 7 foot center scored 24815 points the 13th highest nba total in 1996 he was voted one of the 50 greatest players in nba history he turned 40 last month and has been fighting injuries his retirement was no surprise i 've thought about it a lot ewing said basketball has been very good to me i 've made a lot of friends and some enemies i felt it was time for me to move on it was a great ride it was a hard decision to make because i think i could still play but it was time for me to go on to the next chapter of life critics in the news media often called ewing selfish more interested in personal than team accomplishments fans berated him mostly for never winning an nba championship but as oakley said of the sellout crowds at madison square garden they pay their money it 's not about being fair for one day love conquered all i love new york ewing said i would n't trade it for anything in the world the good the bad if i had to do it over again some things would change but i enjoyed every minute i enjoyed the fans they were great we had some good times i 'm sorry we could n't bring a championship here i hope that one day new york will have a champion i would n't be anywhere else than new york it will always be my home but not his next place of employment that will be in washington where he will assist doug collins and help coach the team president michael jordan if jordan plays another season not coincidentally ewing and jordan who were longtime rivals on the court have the same agent david falk when you 're a player people always ask you what you want to do when you finish ewing said i still do n't know the wizards offered me a job and i will take it it 's a learning experience i 'm going to work at it as hard as when i played i 'll still be involved i 'll be happy i 'm not going to consider myself just a big man 's coach i think i have got more to offer falk would not discuss specifics of ewing 's coaching contract it 's not signed yet falk said it 's short term he wants to see if he likes it it 's a two way audition ewing said he had coaching offers from a lot of other teams he said he talked with the knicks and was told they had nothing to offer this year but would have something next year his retirement ewing said is more or less final a few teams have called and said they needed a center he said but unless someone on the wizards goes down i do n't think it will happen in recent weeks ewing discussed the decision with williams his knicks understudy and now a knicks assistant john thompson his coach at georgetown and van gundy williams said he told ewing that coaching was far different from playing you 've got to get used to it williams said and doing it every day it 's not like coming in for two or three hours a day you 're there before the players come and you 're there after they go home it 's not like looking at one player on tape and figuring how to guard him you have to take a broader look van gundy said i think patrick will do well in learning to coach i do n't think you can determine until it 's done whether he will enjoy it coaching is a different life from playing it 's hard for any great player like himself when he 's coaching and has to deal with players less committed and less talented his knowledge of the game will help oakley a power forward who played with the chicago bulls last season was ewing 's teammate for 10 years on the knicks as a player patrick just came to work and put in a lot of effort oakley said as a coach he 'll do a good job jackson a former knicks point guard now with denver said what made patrick a great player was determination discipline and dedication i played against him when i was at st john 's and we were scared of him he was supposed to be a mean giant on and off the court that was the farthest from the truth when i came to the knicks he was the one who embraced me he made life a lot easier for me if it were n't for him i would n't be playing for these 16 years how would ewing like to be remembered as a hard hat a hard nose with the work ethic that i brought he said jeff van gundy said that for a guy who did n't have a lot of athletic ability you showed them a lot i 'm a guy who tried to do his best to help his team win basketball did n't come easy to me a lot of things did n't come easy to me i 'm proud of what i 've accomplished i thought i had a great career
