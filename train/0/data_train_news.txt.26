 when two fancy and entertaining offenses are featured in a high wire football act the difference in the game often is the defense that clips the wire sending the opponent 's offense tumbling into mistakes and mediocrity the denver defense brought its shears today against st louis the broncos beat the rams 23 16 in a game that was supposed to be a firecracker but dissolved into sporadic sparks yet the game was full of crafty plays and colored by big and punishing hits for the 75710 fans at invesco field at mile high stadium the joy was supplied by the broncos who had the better licks all day long denver limited st louis to 32 rushing yards only 1 yard in the first half running back marshall faulk gained only 19 yards on 10 carries fifteen of those yards came early in the fourth quarter the broncos intercepted rams quarterback kurt warner once and also forced a turnover on a kickoff return but the most important thing they did was keep the rams out of the end zone allowing only faulk 's 3 yard scoring run early in the third quarter leading by 16 13 the broncos stopped the rams on a fourth and 1 pass at the denver 9 late in the third quarter the rams fourth quarter possessions went this way a missed 39 yard field goal attempt and a successful field goal from 39 yards in between denver scored on a 23 yard touchdown pass from quarterback brian griese to wide receiver ed mccaffrey on a drive that featured a conversion on fourth and 1 at the broncos 38 yard line the broncos employing a defense devised by the coordinator ray rhodes pressured the rams offense into a funk this game was for those who are used to getting physical broncos defensive end trevor pryce said linebacker al wilson added it was just one of those situations where you felt unstoppable i do n't care how many yards you get when you do n't score you do n't win warner threw for 315 yards but did not have his usual scoring output teams have gotten a lot of pressure on us with their front four and we have to do a better job with that warner said the rams understandably were in a foul mood they were not about to concede that denver was a better team or even a special team denver played a good game today but basically they made the plays they needed to rams cornerback aeneas williams said we 've got to get everyone playing up to full throttle and in this first game we did n't do that the broncos leaped ahead 10 0 with the rams setting up denver 's first touchdown grant winstrom roughed the punter in denver 's end zone with the penalty the broncos got the ball back and sustained their drive denver drove 97 yards in 13 plays and scored on a 7 yard touchdown pass from griese to rod smith the rams managed only two field goals in the first half and trailed by 16 6 i thought they took the fight to us pretty good in the first half rams coach mike martz said they were more physical than we were they shook us up a bit st louis started the second half with a williams interception that led to faulk 's 3 yard scoring run and st louis ended the third quarter with the ball at the denver 9 facing a fourth and 1 rather than attempt a tying field goal martz went for the jugular the broncos pressure on warner and poor route running by rams fullback chris hetherington he slipped on his release into the right flat although martz said he was pushed thwarted the play in the fourth quarter rams place kicker jeff wilkins 's failed field goal attempt set up the broncos drive that ended with a touchdown catch by mccaffrey the rams found themselves in a hole too deep to crawl out of the critical play was the fourth and 1 15 yard pitch play from griese to the rookie running back clinton portis that ended at the st louis 47 yard line i felt at that time that we could n't get anything going and they are a very explosive football team and if you give them too many chances you 're making a mistake denver coach mike shanahan said i went with a gut feeling we said 'hey let 's try to win it right here we felt we had a play that we had n't shown them in a long time and it might catch them off balance luckily it worked or i 'm sure i would be getting second guessed right now i thought we needed it and i 'm glad the players bailed me out from what could have been a bad call the rams smirked at the broncos play choice because they said it was a play they made popular in the 1999 season denver used it to kill the rams chances it was an excellent play call martz said we ran it in '99 and we kind of put it on the shelf a little bit i guess it 's coming back so are the broncos but thus far the same can not be said for the rams offense everybody may think they have a blueprint on how to beat us now but i would n't say that the rams kim herring said we just have to get back to balance and scoring and winning like on this day the broncos
