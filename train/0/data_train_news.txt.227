 by dismantling a once mighty but obliging tennessee team to capture the women 's basketball national championship the connecticut huskies did everything they had done so well during the season only this time they did it better i 've told these kids all year long that every pass we make in practice every cut every rebound pretend like it 's the one that 's going to win the national championship uconn coach geno auriemma said after his team celebrated its 71 52 victory against tennessee in sunday night 's national collegiate athletic association title game these kids have practiced like this all year long and the night that they had to do it they did it better than any other time in the season he said and the fact that we did it against a team as good as tennessee makes this an accomplishment all the more worthwhile because i know how hard it is to beat them the huskies 36 1 made a shocking spectacle out of the anticipated rubber match capping a near perfect season with a flawless performance they avenged their only loss of the season which came at home against tennessee by sticking to their steamrolling mentality while adopting the lady vols trademark defense as their own from the opening minutes uconn executed the fast break like a practice drill and spun the lady vols silly on backdoor cuts and with tennessee 's shooting guard kristen clement sidelined with a severely sprained ankle the huskies took advantage of the situation they were able to trap the lady vols young guards into 26 turnovers connecticut also frustrated tamika catchings the nation 's best collegiate player in limiting her to six shots while the rest of the lady vols missed easy baskets connecticut missed nothing or at least it seemed that way the huskies shot 508 percent from the floor and as they have done all season the huskies overwhelmed their opponent with a deep arsenal of talent from the bench such an imbalance made for bad theater but that might have been the only failing on a night when the huskies could do no wrong they started the season at no 1 and ended it in the same lofty place connecticut and tennessee 33 4 split the home and home series in the regular season with tennessee taking the most recent game in storrs conn when the huskies relinquished a 14 point lead they were not giving away anything sunday night shea ralph would not let them connecticut 's redshirt junior willed her team to the title flashing an out of my way glare ralph was determined to make those excruciating six hour sessions of rehabilitating her knees mean something i have worked so hard over these past two or three years and i have n't wanted anything as badly as i wanted it tonight ralph said after leading the huskies with 15 points 6 steals and 7 assists ralph 's all american teammate svetlana abrosimova contributed 14 points while the 6 foot 5 inch center kelly schumacher had nine blocks all three players are juniors point guard sue bird the magical ingredient in uconn 's chemistry this season is a sophomore so are the post players swin cash asjha jones and tamika williams the senior forwards stacy hansmeyer and paige sauer will graduate this year but the huskies will hardly notice what is more uconn will bring in four of the nation 's top freshmen next season i think next year it 's going to be even better because we know that we won a national championship so we just have to repeat that abrosimova said connecticut won its first title since the 1995 team went 35 0 and also beat tennessee for the crown that year the huskies used seven players this year they went with 10 and they will only get deeper tennessee returns all of its starters as well including catchings and clement without clement who averaged 56 points a game the lady vols lacked experience and emotion in the title game sunday would that have changed the outcome of this game tennessee coach pat summitt said i ca n't say that that would have happened she 's been our best defender on the perimeter when we started i thought it really affected our press offense throughout the game summitt bore a resigned look on the sideline her team was self destructing catchings did not score the first of her 16 points until there were four minutes left in the first half by then the game was already over semeka randall hit only 1 of her 11 shots no one played defense one game does n't mean your program is falling apart or that you ca n't be competitive at this level summitt said we are not going away i 'm certainly not on my way out and we 'll be back here hopefully again next year the championship was hyped as a potential groundbreaking event pitting the top two teams in the country but the final had no cosmic significance it was simply a game won by a team far better than any other right now i 'm sure the people at espn would have much preferred a double overtime game won on a 3 pointer at the buzzer and i apologize for that auriemma said half seriously the game itself does need more great rivalries connecticut tennessee is one it needs more
