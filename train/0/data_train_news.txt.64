 it was function over fashion on the second day of the australian open jan michael gambill that once glittering young american hope walked onto court 1 today wearing a long sleeve white shirt clinging to his sculpted torso and was dismissed in straight sets 6 2 6 4 7 6 6 by wayne ferreira the still dangerous south african in last season 's clothes sixth seeded justine henin with her no nonsense cap and all business backhand shrugged off the wolf whistles and commotion in the stands and got the best of the better known but less forceful anna kournikova in her powder blue outfit with stylish white belt 6 2 7 5 pete sampras with american flags on his shirts and shorts in the spots usually reserved for his sponsors logos played precise and formidable attacking tennis to win his opening match against jarkko nieminen of finland 6 3 6 3 6 4 why the flags sampras 's deal with nike has expired and negotiations over a new agreement have broken down i can wear whatever i want so i thought i 'd wear this and a lakers cap said sampras his favorite team 's headgear in place for his postmatch news conference andre agassi might have withdrawn with a potentially career threatening wrist injury but sampras his longtime american measuring stick certainly appeared in fine form with his new coach tom gullikson watching from the stands his forehand had pop his serve was humming and at least for another round no one was in any mood to ask him how much longer he intended to keep playing the game that has brought him 13 grand slam singles titles but no titles of any kind in the last 18 months sampras has expressed no desire to stop in the near future and he said he trained more diligently than ever in the off season a concession to his 30th birthday in august and his unspectacular recent results michael chang another american veteran with a grand slam title in his past also continues to train hard but while sampras has been making impressive runs despite the accumulating years reaching last year 's united states open final chang has turned into an articulate hustling journeyman he has not advanced past the third round at a grand slam since 1997 and he did not make it past the first round today losing by 6 4 6 4 6 3 to a player with a marvelous future 20 year old roger federer of switzerland tough draws chang said afterward last week i had marat safin this week federer but i feel i 'm playing well his baseline rallies were entertaining today he is just not playing as well as the younger more powerful and versatile set and there was something symbolic about what happened after the match federer slung his racket bag over his shoulder and sauntered off while chang stuffed his belongings into his bag then rolled it off court on its wheels like a traveler heading for the check in counter at la guardia chang has seen a lot more airports than center courts of late it saves my sore shoulders chang explained our bags get so heavy expectations can be heavy items too last year was full of wide eyed joy for jennifer capriati as she proved that teenage burnout does not mean you will never fulfill your potential nobody expected her to win the 2001 australian open but the replica of the winner 's cup is now the first thing she sees when she walks into her florida home and most eyes were on her today when she walked into rod laver arena as the defending champion and top ranked player in the world i felt more of the butterflies earlier in the week when i made the trip over here i was feeling it she said but since i 've been here being around the grounds and practicing i felt ok i felt more than anything excited and could n't wait to get out there the eyes were also on her upper right leg taped because of a hip flexor that might have played a role in her opening round defeat in sydney last week against alexandra stevenson it was n't my day that day and i was really looking forward to getting here and starting here and maybe i was looking too far ahead of myself she said but that 's exactly why it 's called a warm up tournament though capriati called for a trainer early in the second set to adjust her strapping she covered the court beautifully throughout her 6 4 6 1 victory over silvija talaja of croatia in the seventh game of the opening set she even managed to race to three different corners of the court sprinting to her right to whip a forehand passing shot cross court for a winner you do n't win a rally like that without being very fit but can she maintain her fitness on these hard on the joint hardcourts it 's been a week since i hurt it she said of her leg i think i moved pretty well out there i felt comfortable i 've been able to train full out over the last few days fitness remains a hot topic here in the wake of the agassi 's surprise withdrawal i 'm by no means resigned to this being the end of anything he said before flying home to the united states sampras for one expects to see him on the courts again serena williams seeded fifth also withdrew unable to recover from the right ankle sprain she sustained in sydney last week her first round opponent was to have been conchita martinez who has dropped to 39th in the ranking instead martinez played the russian teenager lina krasnoroutskaya who won the first set martinez rallied to win the second and led by 2 0 in the third when krasnoroutskaya retired with an ankle sprain the moral of today 's story avoid martinez and while you 're at it dress down match points it has been a good start for young american men and that was even before 19 year old andy roddick the leader of the once maligned new wave played his first match taylor dent alex kim and james blake won monday with blake upsetting 14th seeded alex corretja of spain in four sets on tuesday mardy fish defeated the crafty french veteran fabrice santoro in four sets
