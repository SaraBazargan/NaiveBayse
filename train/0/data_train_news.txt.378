 the 2000 giants could win their remaining games win the national football conference east earn a playoff bye and then defeat a team like the philadelphia eagles in the second round of the playoffs they would have won 13 of 17 games the third best record in the modern era of the franchise only the two super bowl teams won more games the giants would be preparing for the nfc championship game and if a team like the minnesota vikings stumbled along the way the giants could even play that game at giants stadium they would be a game away from the super bowl and what would people be saying about the giants that they have n't beaten anyone good yet it would be funny if it were n't so true without question the giants have not yet passed the essential crossroads of their season they could still bow out early from the playoffs or they might still collapse and not make the playoffs at all no one should be labeling them super bowl contenders but the skepticism about their achievements this season has gone too far people are confusing aesthetics with accomplishment at some point the giants deserve praise for making so much of a season that began with insignificant expectations they have played well and maybe it 's time to just say that and leave it at that the giants have an image problem and it has little to do with football yards first downs points the problem stems from the fact that the giants are rarely fun to watch when they are bad as they were against detroit two weeks ago they are revolting when they are good as they were against washington on sunday they are less revolting but do not miss the larger point the giants are winning the way they have to right now if it eventually catches up with them against a team like minnesota remember that super bowl teams are usually not built in a season it does not mean that the giants are not making progress they are it 's true there is no dynamic quality to the offense in fact the giants can be frustrating with the ball are they a run based team led by tiki barber and ron dayne or a medium range passing team directed by kerry collins why do n't they throw the ball deep more why do n't they stick to the run when dayne is going good why do n't they throw more to the tight end but the offense this season is still vastly improved it is without question the best giants offense since phil simms 's last season in 1993 statistically it is the team 's best since 1985 this year 's team is averaging 3372 yards gained per game the most since the 1985 team averaged 3678 the giants redesigned offensive line consistently opens holes for the running backs does not commit many penalties and protects collins dayne is getting better and barber if he can just stay healthy is the most dangerous player on offense collins is maturing showing leadership and grit in difficult situations late in the game sunday with the crowd at fedex field in washington on its feet after the redskins only touchdown you could feel the giants wobbling collins dropped back on third down needing 9 yards no one was open and the crowd screeched because collins was about to be hit in the pocket collins thought he saw amani toomer breaking over the middle but he did not know if he had time to fire the ball in there how many recent giants quarterbacks from dave brown to danny kanell to kent graham would have taken a sack there all three collins later said of the sequence sometimes you 've just got to throw it he did it sailed just past toomer but joe jurevicius who was running the wrong route jumped over two redskins for the football first down how many recent giants wide receivers from thomas lewis to kevin alexander to david patten would have found a way to go up and make that play none the giants offense is getting better the giants defense meanwhile is already capable of playing with virtually any team in the conference it can not be overstated how commanding it was on sunday against a team whose offense had toyed with the giants in recent games the giants have one or two holes defensively but defensive tackle keith hamilton is playing well enough to be in the pro bowl michael strahan is coming on and free safety shaun williams is all over the field knocking people silly the giants have a future star in defensive lineman cornelius griffin and if jason sehorn can stay healthy he still has the talent to win a game by himself if their defense continues to solidify the giants will be a tough opponent for anyone when the season is over people may still be saying that the giants did not beat anyone good do not believe it the giants are a work in progress but one of the things they are good at is making other teams look bad or as coach jim fassel said in a perfectly idiosyncratic moment we force the other people not to play good too at times like these with the playoffs a heartbeat away it 's worth appreciating the art in that too
