 when the devils begin defense of their stanley cup championship tonight in boston against the bruins do not expect this season 's squad to be radically different from the previous dozen or so devils teams there will be some new players in the lineup but they will be expected to get right in step with the stepford like approach that helps make the devils a perennial power in the national hockey league the way this team is run from top to bottom is that it 's all about the team said center erik rasmussen who signed with the devils as a free agent this summer you come in here to help the team win and you put the team in front of yourself no one separates themselves from the others irksome to their detractors but envied by many others the devils have built their success on a robotic commitment to the organization and to a defensive minded system that eschews the star factor and instead focuses on what the group of 20 players can accomplish with three stanley cups in nine years 12 consecutive winning seasons three stanley cup finals appearances in the last four seasons and five atlantic division crowns in the last seven years few can argue with the success of the devils organization there 's no question it is all about winning here said scott stevens who has been captain of the devils since 1992 that 's what we expect from ourselves and there is no question it starts from the top at the top of devils franchise is lou lamoriello their president and general manager who has set the disciplined tone within the organization for 17 seasons the devils style of play reflects lamoriello 's no nonsense style of management it is no surprise that the devils have been able to win the stanley cup with different coaches jacques lemaire in 1995 larry robinson in 2000 and pat burns last season with lamoriello in charge burns will try to guide the devils to back to back titles a feat last accomplished by the detroit red wings in 1997 and 1998 a lot of people do n't believe it can happen but we do burns said once again the linchpin to the devils success will be the play of martin brodeur who won his first vezina trophy as the nhl 's top goaltender last season with brodeur playing in 73 games last season the devils shared the jennings trophy with the philadelphia flyers for allowing the fewest goals in the league 166 my reputation has been made for a while brodeur said winning the vezina does n't change anything guys always try and beat me because of who i am and what i 've accomplished the devils will enter this season with only a handful of new players rasmussen is joined up front by the newcomers igor larionov a 42 year old center and mike rupp who split time last season with the devils and their minor league affiliate in albany before scoring the cup winning goal against the anaheim mighty ducks last spring on defense the 22 year old rookies paul martin and david hale made the team after playing well in the preseason the devils also signed sean brown as a free agent during the summer we 're the team to beat and we 've been through this before brodeur said our system means we 'll be in every game we play this season
