 both of his goals were nice each in its own way but neither was the best play of jaromir jagr 's performance his singular moment came on his assist what an assist against the philadelphia flyers tuesday night in game 3 of the pittsburgh penguins second round series of the stanley cup playoffs skating with the puck on his stick jagr turned away from the flyers net and took off in the opposite direction by the time he neared the blue line jagr had drawn three of the five flyers skaters into a merry chase of course i know that jagr said when asked about the people behind him i was waiting for our defenseman to jump in the hole you know where guys are when the penguins defenseman bob boughner moved into the vacated space jagr turned and flipped a pass over a stick to him boughner redirected the puck diagonally across the zone to martin straka who cut to the suddenly vulnerable net and knocked it past the goalie brian boucher it was no surprise that jagr had created all three pittsburgh goals he is the league 's reigning scoring champion and most valuable player going into games tonight jagr led the tournament in goals with 8 and in points with 16 although his performance tuesday was brilliant it was not enough to avoid a 4 3 defeat in overtime which left the penguins leading the four of seven game series by 2 games to 1 game 4 is here on thursday night and jagr is confident he said his team can play better and so can he oh of course jagr said we lost one game in overtime all of a sudden we 're going to say 'they 're better we 're good enough to beat anybody jagr said he had not fully recovered from the leg and back injuries that limited him to 63 appearances in the 82 game regular season today i feel a little bit better he said it 's going to be better and better hopefully my confidence is not here yet my skating is not there he said his current play is 60 percent or 70 percent of his capability hopefully it 's going to come jagr said referring to his peak level i need it the team needs it the national hockey league needs it too with wayne gretzky retired and eric lindros injured again the sport needs a star hook on which to hang its hype helmet a charismatic attacker to improve the entertainment level from the defensive deadened depths of recent seasons jagr who apprenticed under mario lemieux in the 1990 's might be that man in his 10th season jagr 28 is the team 's captain and the symbol of its composition he is from the czech republic and so are five of his teammates six more penguins are from other european nations the coach in waiting is ivan hlinka the associate head coach who is expected to replace herb brooks in the top job next season hlinka coached the czech republic to the olympic gold medal in 1998 during practice today while hlinka spoke and gestured with his hands jagr rested on one knee in front of him head raised eyes fixed the penguins are owned now by lemieux who rescued them and the money owed to him from bankruptcy court the general manager is craig patrick both men are among the progressives in their business they are matched in this round against the flyers whose chairman ed snider and general manager bob clarke are among the league 's traditionalists in terms of roster makeup for the game on tuesday all but one of the flyer players were from north america in game 2 frustrated by pittsburgh 's surprising two victories in philadelphia the flyers started a 10 man brawl darius kasparaitis the pittsburgh defenseman from lithuania was attacked by keith jones this is the year 2000 kasparaitis said not the year 1960 i do n't know what they 're trying to prove but they do n't scare us in terms of playing style the penguins are what is called an east west team that attacks by skating and passing from side to side while waiting for the perfect shooting moment the flyers are a north south team that rushes down lanes and fires lots of shots in game 3 the flyers outshot the penguins by 44 18 they have many good players suited to this style among them is john leclair the big left wing who scored once and knocked two pittsburgh defensemen out of the game at least temporarily after heavy unpenalized collisions no doubt the flyers would love to do the same to jagr but he is both strong and slippery difficult to hit commit too soon and he will embarrass you the way he did several times tuesday against philadelphia defenseman eric desjardins the flyers captain and one of the best at his craft what are they going to do jagr asked rhetorically i 've played the game long enough to control it the way i want to like lemieux before him jagr complains frequently about the holding hooking tripping and interference that often goes without penalty and allows mediocre players to bring good players down to their level for relaxation jagr said he has an interesting choice of sports on television i do n't watch hockey i watch basketball playoffs jagr said look at allen iverson if you are good enough and fast enough no way they are going to stop you in hockey they play physical with body checks and they put the stick on you in basketball they ca n't even put a hand on you that 's what i like about that game in hockey it 's not that easy certainly he was exaggerating for effect but his analogies and observations suggest a larger issue in the immediate sense the penguins and flyers are playing only for the right to meet the devils or toronto in the eastern conference finals in the larger sense it sometimes seems as if these two teams are struggling for the soul of their sport
