 when greg maddux walked into the braves clubhouse today someone mentioned that the team had a security meeting at 3 o'clock oh yeah the pitcher said rocker 's pitching no john rocker the inflammatory atlanta closer was not the reason for the meeting nearly two months ago kevin hallinan head of security for major league baseball had scheduled today as the day he would meet with the braves on his annual spring training tour with incredible coincidence the meeting wound up on the day rocker made his first exhibition appearance suspended for comments he made about whole segments of society rocker pitched one inning against the detroit tigers tonight receiving a standing ovation from most of the fans then spoke as combatively about the news media as he had about the people he disparaged first he said he was speaking to reporters and television cameras only because manager bobby cox had asked him to if it were up to me i would n't he said then commenting on the fans overall positive reaction he said the best thing i got out of that it showed you people in the media that not everybody 's against me i 've been running into nothing but positives ever since all this stuff has happened wherever he has gone the 25 year old closer said atlanta mexico arkansas new orleans he was well received yet he said every night i turn the tv on and see how horrible a person everyone says i am rocker was n't supposed to be in camp with the braves tonight well not if commissioner bud selig had anything to do with it selig had suspended the left hander for all of spring training and the first four weeks of the season but baseball 's impartial arbitrator shyam das slashed the suspension from 73 days to 14 the first two weeks of the season rocker arrived in camp march 2 nearly two weeks after all of the team 's other pitchers but he exhibited no signs tonight of being behind dashing from the bullpen to the mound to the accompaniment of a standing ovation that drowned out a few scattered boos from the crowd of 10078 a record for the three year old disney stadium rocker unleashed his fastball as soon as gregg jefferies the first batter stepped into the box his first pitch a fastball high and outside was clocked at 95 miles an hour i told everybody i was going to throw 75 80 percent let myself get in shape first rocker said i ca n't pitch like that i 've tried it and i ca n't do it last year i came out and threw really hard early on and by about april 10 or 15 my elbow was hurting pretty bad i had to take about two weeks off but i ca n't throw half speed i do n't know how to rocker retired all three batters he faced with a total of 14 pitches closing out the braves 4 0 victory saying he was disappointed with his control but pleased with his stuff rocker said it just seemed like another night to me once again the media tried to make a big deal out of it it was an inning in a meaningless spring training game he will pitch next in venezuela saturday against tampa bay appearing before a crowd of people who were one of the groups he disparaged in a magazine interview that led to the disciplinary action against him his incendiary words are expected to follow him into and perhaps throughout the season and create potential security problems obviously i 'll be monitoring the situation hallinan said before his meeting with the braves many of the braves players said nothing unusual has occurred with rocker in camp attributing the absence of ill feeling to their desire to play as a team and return to the world series i do n't think there is tom glavine said when asked if there was a problem with rocker what guys say publicly and privately are maybe different things but i have n't heard from anybody privately who has a problem in the immediate aftermath of the publication of rocker 's remarks brian jordan became one of his severest critics everybody 's going about their business which is the way it 's supposed to be the right fielder said today no sense holding it against him who says you have to like everybody you play with it 's never been the case in any professional sport he 's under the microscope jordan said we 're going to see how he reacts if he keeps his mouth shut catcher eddie perez said we 're going to be ok
