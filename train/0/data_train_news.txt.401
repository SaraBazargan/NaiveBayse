 even though the season 's opener between the jets and the washington redskins is almost six months away the game is starting to look like a sequel to an off season slugging match between the teams in the latest round the jets complained to the national football league that the redskins made an illegal offer to their top wide receiver laveranues coles the redskins have already plucked right guard randy thomas and place kicker john hall from the jets as free agents they also tried to acquire kick returner chad morton but the jets matched the redskins offer on thursday allowing them to keep morton now they are asking the league to look into the redskins seven year 35 million offer to coles as first reported on cbssportslinecom yesterday the redskins are accused of having offered coles the contract last sunday but not reporting it to the league until wednesday league rules require that a team report an agreement immediately by not doing so a team could tie up a player without a contract the redskins apparently needed the extra time to free salary cap space before coles signed the offer sheet which included a 13 million signing bonus a league spokesman greg aiello declined to comment but generally if a news report is significantly in error the league rebuts it the jets general manager terry bradway said of coles 's offer sheet we have until wednesday to make a decision if we want to match it coles 's agent roosevelt barnes jr could not be reached yesterday according to cbssportslinecom the redskins did not have enough cap money available to sign coles to the offer sheet on sunday night the team waited until wednesday before sending the signed agreement to the league and then faxed it that night to the jets if the nfl determines that the redskins violated the rules it is not certain that the redskins would lose coles the jets could also make the whole issue moot by matching the offer but if the offer is upheld and the jets do not match it they would receive the redskins first round draft pick the 13th over all the jets and the redskins open the season on sept 4
