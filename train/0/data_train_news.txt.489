 the third down defense one of the few causes of concern for the jets in an otherwise feel good preseason was given a boost today when coach herman edwards said that john abraham the pro bowl defensive end was expected to be ready for the season opener sept 8 at buffalo abraham who partly tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee aug 3 practiced for the first time monday and felt no lingering effects of the injury he practiced again today and participated in some contact work edwards said that barring a setback abraham would be healthy enough to play in pass rushing situations his specialty when the regular season begins the more he practices especially because he has to get used to the brace the more he can change directions edwards said he 's able to really lean on the corner and get around there the more confidence he gains in himself the faster he 'll start playing the jets will use whatever abraham can give them on saturday the giants converted 8 of 13 third down opportunities for first downs against the jets the 62 percent conversion rate displeased edwards the pass rush has felt abraham 's absence except in isolated cases it has failed to pressure the quarterback it has brought back memories of the playoff game against oakland in january when abraham was ill and the pass rush languished in the locker room with him that is why the jets want to make sure abraham is at full strength before reintroducing him to practice and games he was hurt in a full contact goal line play in practice and he will be kept out of those practices for at least a few more days edwards said he would not play against the philadelphia eagles on friday night the jets final preseason game abraham has not played in any of the preseason games abraham will wear a brace in practices and also in games he said he seldom thought about the oakland game he is delighted to return and said he was already comfortable wearing the brace because he wore one in college for a similar injury in the same leg he said he had no fear of reinjuring the knee that was my hope when i first got hurt to be back for the first game abraham said him saying something like that just encourages me that i 'm doing well and everything is going all right my confidence level is high even when i was hurt i was confident i would be back i 'm on pace to do that i just want to see how my contribution fits in i hope i 'll be able to fit in perfectly how everybody is playing together for his teammates there is no question abraham will fit in he 's definitely missed nickel back ray mickens said his presence will definitely be felt you just have confidence that somebody will get to the quarterback if they double team him it leaves someone else open abraham said he did not want to press himself too much in his return although he would like to go full speed in practice speed of course is abraham 's greatest asset my speed gets me there but my mind tells me where to go abraham said i might not move as fast as i was before but once i get used to the brace everything will be ok extra points the jets are close to completing a contract extension for running back curtis martin general manager terry bradway said it was possible a deal could be signed this week i hate to say for sure until it 's for sure bradway said the extension will be for at least seven years the agent eugene parker said and it will allow martin to finish his career with the jets the deal will include a signing bonus in excess of 10 million we have a mutual goal and that is to have curtis martin remain a jet for the rest of his career parker said st louis running back marshall faulk who is a year older than martin recently signed a seven year deal worth 4395 million it included a 93 million bonus a new contract will give the jets needed salary cap relief martin would have counted nearly 20 million against the cap over the next two seasons without a new contract once the jets clear the space they can move ahead on discussions for new contracts for center kevin mawae and receiver wayne chrebet proposals have been exchanged on deals for mawae and chrebet bradway said safety sam garnes fractured his left thumb tuesday he will be re evaluated by a hand specialist wednesday his availability will be determined at that point he will not play in friday 's exhibition he will most likely be replaced by nick ferguson receiver santana moss sore hamstrings did no full speed work and rode a bike for part of the time
