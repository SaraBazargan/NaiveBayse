the sign in front of the steepled church read sunday sermon does god prefer particular sports teams a man passing by gives the sign a befuddled look the scene is in fact a cartoon in the current new yorker but the question is a good one since it has more or less been in the news the guy checking out the sign might very well have been aware of the strange one hesitates to say celestial sports goings on in new york and chicago in recent weeks in fact supernatural and miracle win were among the encomiums not infrequently used regarding certain yankee postseason triumphs the same has been true for the bears in three of the bears last four games they have won in stunning fashion on sunday they were leading 27 24 near the end when tampa bay 's 49 yard field goal attempt hit the right upright bears win earlier the bears won two straight against san francisco and cleveland by rallying to tie the game in the fourth quarter and win it in overtime against the 49ers mike brown intercepted a pass in overtime and ran it in for the victory against cleveland same guy did it again why the bears atop the their division with a 7 2 mark why now we 've gotten some breaks said the head coach dick jauron who was 11 21 in his first two seasons there 's no doubt the ball 's bounced our way more than it has the last two seasons hmm yes now no one is quite sure what reason might be behind a greater power looking especially kindly on chicago and the bears new york however was a different story after the tragic events on sept 11 it was said that the yankees spectacular grit raised the city 's spirit it began with the yankees coming back from two games down against oakland in the division series with a phenomenal play by derek jeter but one the yankees actually practiced saving the yankees from what might have been a series ending loss the yankees stormed back to win the next two games and the series and as a reminder to those fans who happened to be standing in line on broadway for cancellations for the producers and missed all the action the yankees down by two games to one to arizona in the world series won two straight games in suspiciously similar fashion trailing with two outs in the ninth inning of game 4 the yankees tied the score on a two run homer and another homer in the 10th won it in game 5 same thing behind with two outs in the ninth and a two run homer tied the game the yankees then won it in the 12th the yankees alas lost the series to essentially a better diamondbacks team but the free agent period in which players could begin signing yesterday reminds us that miracles have had less to do with the yankee success in recent years than with their good free agent picks mike mussina and david wells for two and good trades such as those for roger clemens tino martinez and scott brosius as well as a farm system that produced the likes of jeter andy pettitte and bernie williams the arizona miracles rested primarily in the left and right arms of randy johnson and curt schilling the bears like the yankees have added important free agents this season signing ted washington at 380 pounds and keith traylor at 340 to erect a virtual wall on the defensive line their top two draft picks running back anthony thomas and receiver david terrell have each had substantial impact and some of our other players are maturing and the players absolutely do n't give up said bill mcgrane director of administration for the bears what about deific intervention there 's an old russian proverb he said it goes 'pray devoutly hammer stoutly religion has often played a part in sports including pregame prayers the rev edward a malloy president of notre dame said if both sides are praying who is god paying attention to it 's like it has more to do with our sense of preparation and dependency rather than legitimately expecting god is going to favor one side over the other bernardo harris a packer linebacker had said it another way before his team 's game against the bears two weeks ago he said he could n't be bothered with talk about the bears being a miracle team we 're worried about hitting people in the mouth making big plays and winning games he said the packers then performed a miracle of their own they beat the bears suddenly and stunningly earthly
