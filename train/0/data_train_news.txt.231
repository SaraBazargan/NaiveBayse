 for rafaelina garrett 42 and her four youngest children the holiday season is not so much about gifts this year in their home in queens not far from kennedy airport there is no glittering christmas tree with a star on top nobody is expecting presents they will spend christmas day just hanging around the house said ms garrett but there is still plenty for this family to celebrate tomorrow morning ms garrett will graduate from the american academy mcallister institute of funeral service in manhattan with an associate degree in mortuary science though ms garrett 's oldest daughter sophia 17 rolled her eyes as her mother talked at length about embalming she will join three of her siblings and attend her mother 's commencement ceremony ms garrett who put aside full time work for school knows she made the right decision i 'm happy after all these years of raising my kids that i was finally able to accomplish something she said times were hard and i 've had to make sacrifices but it has been worth it when ms garrett speaks about hard times she is talking about her family 's two year stay in a queens shelter which began in 1998 though she struggled as a single mother she never imagined that she would be homeless the family used to have a comfortable apartment in jackson heights and as a correction officer ms garrett had no problem providing for her children but after 12 years she felt she needed a career change so she sent the children to the dominican republic where her parents lived she put her furniture in storage and moved in with a friend she had plans to enroll in school in the fall and she was thinking about a former supervisor 's suggestion that she consider a career in funeral work although she was unsure what she would study she had a plan for her family i wanted to go back to school save money and put down on a house she said but in a matter of months in the fall of 1998 her father developed heart problems and had to have surgery sent back to new york because they could no longer receive the proper care from their grandparents the children ages 5 through 12 at the time had no place to come home to a shelter was the only option i did n't want my kids to be split up she said i had to put away my pride so we could all stay together as she sat in the living room of her current home a modest green and white three bedroom ms garrett shared the painful memories of shelter life there were the three nights spent sleeping in chairs the almost daily police presence the cramped studio unit with five beds the insufficient cooking space the disciplinary problems her youngest son antonio just 6 when the family went to the shelter had in five different schools i do n't want to remember she said i was always depressed and i think my kids felt sorry for me sophia who will complete high school in january remembers trying to hide her shelter life from friends and as the oldest having to maintain order among her siblings in her mother 's absence she was the mother when i was at work recalled ms garrett who had a full time security job at macy 's during the shelter days and there was another mother across the hall who helped out in the fall of 2000 the garretts found government subsidized housing with a monthly rent of 1300 but there was still that idea of becoming a funeral director in august 2002 she enrolled in school after months of juggling full time work and her studies ms garrett realized that she was spending too much time away from her children so she left her job to concentrate on her family and her classes with grants loans and some public assistance she was able to support her children and to be at home when they returned from school still in september of this year ms garrett had trouble paying her rent fearful of having to return to a shelter she turned to catholic charities diocese of brooklyn and queens one of the seven charities supported by the new york times neediest cases fund with 200 from the fund ms garrett was able to pay her overdue rent her caseworker stephanie hudgins also brought the family groceries from the food pantry i admire her tenacity and her faith ms hudgins said she moved into a house and made it a home tomorrow when ms garrett strides across the stage and gets her degree she will be one step closer to making her dreams for her career and her family a reality she
