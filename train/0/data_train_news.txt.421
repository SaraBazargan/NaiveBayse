 if only we could be a little more like the six stars of friends the nbc hit comedy it 's not their fame that is so appealing but rather their all for one one for all approach to negotiating when renewing their contracts early this year their strategy was that if they did n't make a certain amount per episode the same for each star they 'd all walk ultimately that amount would be 750000 most of us do n't have a posse of pals who can put their careers on hold for us nor do most people believe that they are worth that much simply to show up rehearse lines block movements and roll tape since most of us do n't have agents and lawyers negotiating our every move it is up to us to conduct our own business deals and most of us myself included fail miserably for starters there is the ego issue creative types and those just starting out often feel privileged to get paid to express themselves and they forget that they 're providing a service said david wallis a freelance writer and chief executive of featurewellcom a manhattan based syndicate for established journalists i know just what he means the first time i published an article at the age of 21 i was so thrilled that someone was willing to pay me to write i would have paid them the 25 it did n't occur to me that i could have asked for 30 after all why be contentious when a million other eager young writers are out there all waiting to take your place when you 're younger you do n't realize that you 're supposed to play the business game and you have no experience at it anyway said david seigerman 34 a producer at cnn sports illustrated i always folded too quickly and i probably lost a lot of money because of it he said of some earlier jobs as a writer then there are the transactions themselves do you wait for the potential employer to mention money or do you bring it up yourself should you ask if there is room to go higher or should you say something like oh 500 is fine but my dog needs a liver transplant and my roof is caving in so do you think you could up it a few grand and let me start my workday at noon never ask to negotiate said brian d krueger author of college grad job hunter adams media and a webmaster and content provider at collegegradcom a career web site for recent college graduates you should go into every situation assuming that everything is open to negotiation he said without that assumption you would give up a negotiating chip without getting anything in return a fatal error in negotiating and may never even get to the table since they could slam the door in your face to bring up external and or personal circumstances is also not a valid approach since there 's no ownership of these issues on the other side the best approach he said is to be straightforward and never give away anything without gaining something in return easy for him to say i 've orchestrated deals that i naively thought were clear to both parties only to find that our definitions of say flexible hours and nontraditional workplace were radically different the solution mr wallis said is to get it in writing assume that you could always be misunderstood he said so do n't be afraid to ask for a three line clarification even a 'what if scenario to that end be sure to get a second opinion from a trusted professional a friend who has been in the same situation or an industry expert before signing on the dotted line that advice applies even if that line was put there by your agent or lawyer the process is less awkward than it used to be because more people of all ages are conducting their job negotiations through e mail which leaves a record of the discussions you can carefully choose your wording to present the information in the most effective manner perhaps even including additional back up information which might not normally be included in an oral exchange mr krueger said in this way the negotiating becomes much more controlled and systematic of course you may still have to accept that a final offer means just that if the job is beneficial to your career your first writing gig for example be practical mr wallis advised at the same time you must be prepared to walk away from what you really want he said clients respect you more if you stand up for yourself be a little cocky do n't be too overeager let them think you do n't need them as much as you do and what if they say they can not match your price and let you wander into the sunset find five buddies to stand up on your behalf it might not get you 750000 an assignment but at least you 'll know who your friends are preludes abby ellin is a manhattan writer her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third sunday of each month e mail preludes nytimescom
