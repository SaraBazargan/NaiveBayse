 the idling trains diesel engines rumble for hours at a time as many as six or seven of them and sometimes all through the night as they wait for their next run up the island the harsh thrumming of the engines is relentless and their diesel vapors waft into the air all this in montauk where the loudest noise is supposed to be the crashing surf the newly formed montauk anti pollution coalition aims to accomplish what its members say other campaigns have failed to do persuade the long island rail road to stop using the rail yard next to the montauk train station as waiting room for trains but the railroad says that turning the engines off is impractical and that there 's nowhere else to park the trains the montauk station is surrounded by hotels motels restaurants and private residences tom bogdan the chairman of the group said that the diesel engines are never turned off and there are always out of service trains idling on the side tracks 365 days and nights a year with the summer and fall being the most objectionable times it ebbs and flows because obviously there are fewer trains off season mr bogdan said however the trains that are there run all night long regardless of if it 's july or january say it is a seasonal thing it 's still important to montauk and we 're still suffering the noise and air pollution the montauk group has sent to peter kalikow chairman of the metropolitan transportation authority and a part time resident of star island in montauk a voluminous report that includes copies of correspondence a petition bearing several hundred signatures maps of the affected areas in the hamlet and even a soundtrack of the idling diesel engines on a compact disk we do not dispute the fact that the lirr provides efficient inexpensive transportation to and from montauk and the east end of long island the report states however the lirr is also the single largest source of industrial noise pollution and related anti environmental activities in this extraordinarily beautiful part of long island through continuous and unnecessary idling of its diesel engines the lirr has created a psychological and physical public nuisance the montauk group 's efforts are being supported by other organizations and individuals in the hamlet among them the concerned citizens of montauk and the town appointed montauk citizens advisory committee bill akin president of the concerned citizens group said his organization had tried for years to change the railroad 's habits at montauk we took a shot some years ago and even got the east hampton town board at the time to send a letter to the mta saying they wanted this problem resolved mr akin said the mta wrote back and said we ca n't change things because it 's easier to let the engines run than shut them down and have to start them up again hours later other than that the town ca n't do anything because it has no jurisdiction over the property mr bogdan added there has been as lot of unhappiness for a long time but the complaints were from individuals they did n't know how to organize there were plenty of complaints but no concerted effort now we 've got one janice nessel is the general manager of the montauk manor a former hotel converted into a condo with 140 suites 45 of them facing the train station guests ms nessel wrote in an aug 2 letter to the mta are outraged at the sound levels that go on throughout the night and want a refund over the course of years the loss of thousands of dollars by montauk manor can be directly attributed to the long term and overnight idling of lirr diesel engines brian dolan a long island rail road spokesman said the agency understands that there could be some inconvenience but said it can take hours to bring a diesel engine from a cold start to the correct running temperature it comes down to keeping the compressors running for air conditioning during the warmer months in addition to the time consuming process of getting engines ready to work efficiently he said mr dolan stressed that montauk residents should not feel that the lirr is ignoring their concerns where we can shut the trains down we do he said we have taken steps recently with increased staffing to help ease that we 're watching the situation we are looking at different steps we can take every year we work more with east end towns on improved service and the area is important to us russell smith the group 's attorney said he believes the decibel level emitted by the trains exceeds that allowed in the town 's noise pollution law asked how the town could enforce a law on the lirr which is exempt from town regulation he replied just because they 're the railroad does n't mean they can break any laws if a conductor hits someone that 's assault you ca n't hide behind 'i 'm the railroad what 's happening in montauk is just a different form of assault
