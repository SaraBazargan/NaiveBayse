 the conundrum facing the giants defensive coaches as they prepare to play the philadelphia eagles is this do they believe what they have seen with their own eyes or do they believe what they have seen on videotape from the rest of the eagles season because the eagles that the giants saw first hand were n't competitive those eagles were n't even competent but in their 15 other games with rare exceptions the eagles played exceedingly well so which eagles do the giants coaches prepare their team for which set of videotapes will provide the more telling lessons in how to beat the eagles eagles versus giants or eagles against everyone else do you judge an opponent at his worst or his best or does it matter what a team has done against someone else if they can not do it against you and if you 're the giants defensive coordinator john fox and you 've designed a defensive game plan that worked perfectly how do you change it or should you because it 's hard to overstate just how dominant the giants defense was against philadelphia in two games against the giants the eagles have held the football for only 37 minutes 35 seconds that might be a good possession time for one game for two games it 's unimaginable for a team that was heading for the playoffs against the giants the eagles converted only 4 of 21 third down opportunities or 19 percent for the rest of the season the eagles converted 42 percent against the giants the eagles averaged 2145 yards per game against the rest of their opponents 3269 yards so if you 're fox you change nothing and let your veteran defense win another cold weather playoff game for you right but suppose fox changes nothing in his approach to philadelphia and the eagles who will certainly try to alter their attack move the ball successfully against the giants wo n't everyone say fox was a dunce for not adjusting that 's exactly what everyone will say and if fox changes too much and the giants get out of sync and play poorly there 's a chance he will be criticized for tinkering with something that was n't broken in the two previous games the giants front four particularly defensive tackles keith hamilton and cornelius griffin has been too quick for the eagles offensive line linebackers jessie armstead and mike barrow have stuffed the running lanes even containing philadelphia 's magical quarterback donovan mcnabb the secondary has smothered the eagles unheralded wide receiving corps in the first giants eagles meeting a 33 18 giants victory cornerback jason sehorn had a game high eight tackles the other giants cornerback dave thomas had four tackles how do you mess with that kind of success well here 's how you study the eight games the eagles have played since they last saw the giants in a 24 7 loss on oct 29 the eagles lost only one of those games on a last ditch field goal by tennessee if you are the giants defensive coaches you realize that mcnabb has only 25 career starts in the national football league that means more than 30 percent of his nfl experience has come since he last played the giants that 's plenty of time to grow and significantly change as a player the giants may dominate the eagles in the same ways on sunday but it would be suicide to prepare for the same eagles team the giants saw in the two previous games as giants general manager ernie accorsi said yesterday you take away our two games with them and they 've had a tremendous season so you do n't prepare for the team that lost two lopsided games to your team but for the 11 5 team whose three other losses were by a total of 8 points you prepare for a team that manhandled an adept seasoned tampa bay defense last week there may be some risk altering a game plan that succeeded it is riskier to assume that the third game in this series will happen precisely as the two previous ones did besides the giants defense that finished the 2000 regular season is different and better than the one that played the eagles previously the giants defense now is more confident more willing and eager to blitz and especially capable of masking its weaknesses with cohesive play as a unit expect the giants defensive coaches this week to prepare a diverse varied game plan for shutting down the eagles which means shutting down mcnabb as elusive as mcnabb is it 's most unlikely the giants will be timid about attacking him expect the giants to blitz plenty secure in the belief that armstead barrow and free safety shaun williams are quick enough and sure enough tacklers to at least disrupt mcnabb an absolute key as it was when the teams played in september will be sehorn 's coverage of philadelphia 's primary wide receiver charles johnson with each blitz sehorn could easily be left in single coverage johnson caught five passes in the first meeting between the teams but no reception was longer than 9 yards until a 20 yard catch late in the game after sehorn had been replaced by second stringers mcnabb as good as he is is still in his second season in the league what the giants will plan to do is to confuse him with blitzes and coverages from new formations and sets it 's not so much what the giants will do differently it 's how they will look different doing it in the end the giants solution to their conundrum may be forcing mcnabb to believe what he sees with his eyes rather than what he has seen on videotape whoever succeeds in creating the most confusion wins
