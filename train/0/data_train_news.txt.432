 when the ncaa division i men 's lacrosse final was not quite 27 minutes old today second seeded virginia had a 5 0 lead on first seeded johns hopkins but no one from virginia was celebrating yet those things scare you a little bit dom starsia the virginia coach said later because you get a false sense of security his players knew there were problems ahead we were just getting good shots said chris rotelli virginia 's all american midfielder tillman johnson the cavaliers all american goalie said we knew they would have a run johns hopkins made its run but it never got closer than 6 5 virginia made the early lead stand up and won 9 7 giving the cavaliers their second national title in five years under starsia and third over all patiently and carefully virginia nursed its early lead taking its shots from close up meanwhile johnson who played sensationally in saturday 's semifinal rout of maryland was merely spectacular this time with 13 saves johnson a junior from annapolis md was at his best in the fourth quarter after his midfield teammate billy glading drew a 30 second penalty for pushing this is how johnson protected virginia 's 8 5 lead with 13 minutes remaining kyle barrie of johns hopkins raced in and fired a shot point blank johnson saved it but he made a bad clearing pass with 12 minutes 49 seconds remaining bobby benson fired a shot point blank johnson saved it with 12 43 remaining kevin boland fired a shot point blank johnson saved it seventeen seconds three point blank shots three saves those last two were on the doorstep johnson said but this is the time when you have to step up if you 're the hot goalie you 're an asset to your team i had fun i was n't stressed out i did n't tell myself i have to win this thing adam doneger the all american midfielder for johns hopkins took nine shots four on goal and scored twice he had kind words for johnson saying he got the better of me today had there been a betting line johns hopkins 14 2 might have been a three goal favorite over virginia 15 2 but many observers believed that virginia could win if johnson played his best johnson took the bit do i enjoy being the focus he said of course it 's the dream of my life winning the national championship and being voted the player of the game like everyone else connected with the game johnson was excited by the large crowd at mt bank stadium formerly ravens stadium the crowd of 37944 was the largest for an ncaa final breaking the record of 26229 for the 1995 final at the university of maryland 's byrd stadium there was one huge problem the muddy field four days of rain had ended before the game but two games saturday two sunday and one today damaged the grass field players often slipped and tripped without contact once matt ward of virginia diving for a loose ball skidded 7 yards on his back it was probably the worst field i 've ever been on starsia said in a sport in which stopping on a dime and spinning away are routine the mud made a difference starsia dealt with it by having his defenders stick to a man to man defense and not switch off ball control was a factor too virginia held possession for the last shot of the first quarter scoring with two seconds left and did the same with five seconds left in the third quarter aj shannon scored four goals for the cavaliers in 1987 when johns hopkins won its seventh national title dave pietramala was its star defenseman now he is the john hopkins coach and he had praise for virginia if you told me we were going to hold them to nine goals he said i would have told you we were going to win their players played terrific they did a great job attacking the goal we made too many mistakes they deserved to win today and what did starsia the winning coach feel relief he said with a tired smile
