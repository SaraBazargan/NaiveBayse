 michael jordan and the washington wizards minority owner ted leonsis are expected to dine tonight in the washington area a supposedly gentlemanly affair with only one detail at stake perhaps the future of jordan with the team a franchise he and his legions feel he rescued from the nba 's scrap heap though jordan and leonsis get along famously the team 's ownership is generally displeased about the direction jordan has taken the wizards the past three seasons according to two team officials who spoke on condition of anonymity it has raised speculation that the wizards and jordan may part ways as early as tomorrow the dinner is a precursor for a scheduled meeting tomorrow among jordan leonsis and the team 's majority owner abe pollin the meeting is also expected to include curtis polk jordan 's representative and david osnos pollin 's longtime lawyer pollin through a representative and leonsis via an e mail message declined to comment yesterday in a telephone interview polk said jordan still hoped to remain with the team in his previous position as director of basketball operations even after reports of teammate resentment toward jordan who retired this season as a player for the third time and ownership 's concerns about his day to day commitment to an executive position throughout the season it 's always been michael 's hope and intention to sit down with mr pollin and ted leonsis polk said assuming they thought he did a good job as a manager before he would get his position back michael has no list of demands for this meeting all along he has made it really clear that he was to go back to the same job he had before with the same responsibilities we intend to hopefully go in there have a short and sweet meeting and he 'll be the president again jordan 's representatives are privately worried that ownership is interested in a reduced role for jordan but a team official who spoke on condition of anonymity said jordan would not report to anyone else in the organization if he were to return to the club wes unseld the team 's general manager announced last week that he would take a leave of absence after the draft in june the official said that jordan and his advisers had originally planned to ask for more control heading into tomorrow 's meeting control that would include overseeing marketing and other facets of the team 's operations any claims to the contrary have raised concerns about jordan 's intentions after a new deal is struck there is a mistrust on both sides at this point the official said will michael return it 's definitely possible but the road everyone is going down right now is n't conducive to that outcome jordan 's representatives denied any intention to negotiate a role that would give him more executive authority than he had previously the representatives are shocked that ownership has apparently questioned where the team has gone under jordan 's leadership the wizards who sold out every game at the mci center during jordan 's last two seasons on the court finished 37 45 for the second straight season for the sixth straight season and the fourth with jordan involved the wizards failed to advance to the playoffs still pollin and leonsis have publicly been supportive of jordan 's moves to upgrade the franchise including adding player friendly amenities that include building a family lounge for players wives and children and hiring strength coaches moves that have made the franchise a viable option for prospective free agents jordan also rid the team of juwan howard 's exorbitant contract and jettisoned fading veterans like mitch richmond and rod strickland for young talent jordan 's representatives said that no meetings had been scheduled with other nba teams that might offer jordan an ownership role but a person close to jordan who refused to speak for attribution acknowledged calling the league office to ask about a rule against speaking to other teams while jordan was playing any person in a similar situation as michael would take the same action the person with knowledge of jordan 's intentions said but as of right now no meetings have been scheduled michael was just keeping his options open if things did not work out that call upset team officials who felt jordan was already planning an exit strategy charlotte atlanta and possibly milwaukee and miami are said to be among the teams jordan would consider partnerships with in the event he does not return to the wizards how much authority jordan wanted and how much ownership wanted to give has always permeated the relationship between the sides pollin the league 's senior owner at 79 has vowed never to give up majority interest in the franchise hurting jordan 's chances of making all the changes he wanted one of the team officials spoke of an uneasy alliance from the beginning the day jordan was to announce he had forged a partnership with wizards ownership in january 2000 a 4 pm news conference was delayed for 45 minutes allegedly because of last minute demands by jordan and polk at 10 to 4 curtis and michael get on the phone from a car and basically ask abe and ted for a new charter plane through the nba 's service and an agreement that michael would attend no more than six home games per season the official said that 's how everything began
