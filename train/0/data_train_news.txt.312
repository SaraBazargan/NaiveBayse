 the bush administration proposed new wage and hour regulations yesterday that it said would increase the number of low wage workers who qualify for overtime pay but cut the number of higher paid white collar workers who qualify labor department officials estimated that the proposals which face a 90 day comment and review period would add 13 million low paid workers to the group that automatically qualifies for overtime pay the rules they said would exempt an additional 640000 executive administrative and professional workers from qualifying when they work more than 40 hours a week the proposed regulations would alter the criteria for determining which white collar employees can not receive overtime and would make it considerably harder for workers earning more than 65000 a year to qualify for overtime under the existing regulations which have not been updated since 1975 assistant managers of fast food restaurants earning 18000 a year often do not qualify for overtime because they are considered managers under the new rules anyone earning less than 22100 a year would automatically qualify for overtime a significant change from the existing rules under which only workers earning less than 8060 a year automatically qualify for overtime reform of these regulations is absolutely necessary in order to strengthen overtime protection for low wage workers said tammy d mccutchen administrator of the wage and hour division at the labor department department officials said 248 percent of the additional workers who would automatically qualify for overtime under the new rules are hispanic and 547 percent are women bush administration officials said the proposals sought to simplify and modernize regulations under the fair labor standards act of 1938 business groups generally praised the proposed regulations while labor unions harshly criticized them saying they would help employers by exempting large groups of white collar workers from receiving time and a half for overtime union leaders applauded the expanded overtime coverage for low wage workers but predicted that the additional white collar workers exempted from overtime would far exceed the 640000 predicted by the labor department it 's an absolute disaster for white collar workers who deserve protection under these regulations said nick clark senior assistant general counsel with the united food and commercial workers union it 's going to gut protections for many workers in the military airlines energy financial securities and health care industries under current regulations about 70 million workers qualify for overtime because of automatic provisions or because their jobs are not considered exempt executive administrative or professional ones traditionally workers who are considered managers high level administrators or highly skilled professionals have been exempted from overtime coverage to determine whether an administrative employee is exempt from overtime the labor department 's proposal drops the longtime test of whether the worker customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent judgment instead the test would become whether the worker holds a position of responsibility defined as performing work of substantial importance or performing work requiring a high level of skill or training like the existing test the proposed test for administrative workers would also weigh whether their primary duty is to perform office or nonmanual work directly related to the management or general business operations of their employer under the new proposals an executive employee would be exempt if three criteria were met the worker 's primary duty is the management of the enterprise or a department or subdivision the worker regularly directs the work of two or more other employees and the employee has the authority to hire or fire or recommend hiring and firing other employees under the old rules executive employees were exempt if they met those three criteria and two others if they met the test of using discretionary powers and if they did not devote more than 20 percent of their time or 40 percent in retail and service establishments to activities not closely related to exempt work if a nonmanual worker earns more than 65000 a year however only one of the criteria under the new rules must be met union leaders said the revised criteria would make it far too easy for companies to exempt higher paid employees for professional employees the proposed test is whether the worker 's primary duty requires advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction under the existing rules that instruction generally meant college or graduate school but the proposed rules say it could also include military duty technical schools or work experience randel k johnson vice president for labor policy at the united states chamber of commerce said the proposed regulations 13000 words down from the existing 31000 should help slow the flood of class action lawsuits in which many higher paid workers assert that they were wrongly denied overtime we think they 're on the right track simplifying some of these tests mr johnson said we 're encouraged by the fact that they set an upper level salary test with a simplified duties test ms mccutchen said the proposed regulations would not affect workers who qualify for overtime under union contracts
