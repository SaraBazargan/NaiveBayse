 the nets kenyon martin the top overall pick of the 2000 draft did not think about the sharp teeth digging into his shooting hand today instead being the dutiful rookie he fed bananas to the whiskered bearcat the mascot of his alma mater the university of cincinnati and posed for a photo meanwhile a hall of famer from cincinnati oscar robertson looked on in amusement the nets brought robertson in too to lend a festive if not circus like atmosphere to an afternoon infused with optimism by the end the bearcat was eating grapes out of martin 's hand store that image for the future if martin 's bold goals come true in his rookie season the only goal i set for myself is to make the all nba defensive first team said the 6 foot 9 martin who will switch with keith van horn at small and power forward this season martin wants that honor more than rookie of the year because it 's never happened before he said i strive for defense said martin who was conference usa defensive player of the year three times that 's what separates me from a lot of people his soft spoken words resonated on the eve of training camp at the champion center his veteran teammates returning from years of injury and coaching changes were optimistic point guard stephon marbury thought martin 's goal best typified the new nets philosophy he gets big stars for that because the mentality from everyone here is defense marbury said but if martin was the somewhat embarrassed focus today he was certainly not the show unequivocally the new head coach byron scott winner of three national basketball association titles with the lakers and a protege of pat riley and larry brown will run the show because of scott the veterans expect immediate improvement over last season 's 31 51 finish under don casey success comes from the no 1 position and that 's the head coach van horn said last year i think at a lot of times we lacked direction at that position he seems very disciplined comes from a long line of discipline coaches van horn said of scott he 's been on disciplined teams that have won and i hope that will transfer to our court if you put that with our talent level within a great structure a great system and a great coach you can win marbury having fine tuned his shot with scott this summer preached the new feeling it 's totally different not even close marbury said you 're playing for someone who has won championships practiced like a champion you have that person leading you good things are going to happen after scott martin is the key his right leg which he fractured in march has completely healed and he has impressed both marbury and van horn in pickup games i never saw him wince i never saw him flinch van horn said out of all the games i 've never seen kenyon quit once we lacked energy without jayson williams last year kenyon is not jayson but they have the same type of energy his presence is going to be able to help the team one player was not present today shooting guard kendall gill who signed a 7 million one year contract this summer missed media day but arrived in time for tonight 's team meeting a last minute arrangement other free agent acquisitions the 6 9 forward aaron williams and a re signed johnny newman seemed comfortable with their key reserve roles jim mcilvaine evan eschmeyer and jamie feick fitter than ever are prepared to split time at center about the only player not happy to be in uniform today was a limping shooting guard kerry kittles who is out indefinitely it 's a tease he said it 's a bummer i ca n't get ready to play with them tomorrow because this system would really fit me instead kittles will spend some or all of the season rehabilitating from a rare surgery that took bone pieces from his knee and filled holes in the bones of his femur still he might be pleased to be on the sideline tomorrow they 're going to be sore they 're going to be dying scott promised i want to be the best conditioned team in the league he has another goal i know we only won 31 games last year and if we win 40 this year it will probably be considered a success he said still to me we make the playoffs and we 'll be successful martin 's team first attitude is the hallmark of that success scott said adding it makes me feel very good that he wants to be a great defensive player because that 's where we 're heading anyway
