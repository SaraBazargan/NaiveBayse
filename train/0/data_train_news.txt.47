 his first shot in his first practice in more than a month was by his own admission pretty awkward but it took nets center todd macculloch no more than an instant to get it right he grabbed his own rebound and laid the ball in a sign that his problems were largely behind him macculloch who had been sidelined since feb 22 with plantar fasciitis a heel injury in his left foot breezed through his first practice since being placed on the injured list and was given clearance to play in sunday 's game against the atlanta hawks it felt pretty good macculloch said i was able to run the court and all we did n't go all that long today but we did some shooting and i had some contact and afterward i did a little bit extra in the post working on my offense and defense with jason collins i was just trying to get back in the flow a little bit macculloch was in uniform for the nets 108 84 victory friday over milwaukee but coach byron scott decided not to play his 7 foot center until after seeing how he held up in a full practice like macculloch scott was pleased he looked good today scott said i wanted to make sure that i was comfortable with him and that he was comfortable and that 's why i thought having him practice today and have him go up and down the court was very important i wanted him to be able to have no doubt that he was fine watching him i did n't see any glitches which means he was n't favoring that foot he was just going up and down the court and not thinking about it scott said macculloch would play sunday but would not start aaron williams will but scott is confident that macculloch can contribute some productive minutes while working his way back into the starting lineup when his chest starts burning after going up and down the court i 'll be able to see it scott said we did n't do enough today in practice for him to get too tired being that he has n't played in a month i 'm sure he 'll be a little anxious and a little excited i 'll try to monitor his minutes a little bit the nets struggled in macculloch 's absence going 7 8 after being acquired from philadelphia during the off season he has proved to be a steady and reliable force inside and is averaging 99 points and 62 rebounds the nets acknowledged they missed him he gave us rebounds blocked shots and points in the paint jason kidd said he can open up the perimeter game for other guys because he can go inside and score or pass he brings a lot to the table we did n't overlook his absence we knew there were some matchups particularly out west where we needed him the important thing is that we held the ship together and are right where we were when he went out scott is happy the nets are happy and macculloch is very happy for him a tough time is at last over this has been the most difficult period of my basketball life he said there have been a lot of mind games going on it was always a case of 'should i sit out or should i play with it at what point do you make a decision it 's been really difficult and i just hope it 's over it appears that it may be the nets a team that was hit with an overwhelming run of injuries last season are hoping to be at full strength for the playoffs now that macculloch is back right now we are playing good basketball and we feel like everybody is getting healthy at the right time scott said getting todd back is another piece of the puzzle one that we were missing rebounds the nets have two games left on their regular season schedule against philadelphia which will be without allen iverson for four to six weeks iverson broke a bone in his hand in friday 's victory against boston philly is a talented team so you ca n't count them out jason kidd said larry brown will get those guys to play look at what happened against boston iverson missed the second half and they still won the nets will probably clinch a spot in the playoffs next week something they have not done in five seasons
