 islanders coach peter laviolette remembers what it was like to watch a videotape of a game and be able to skip past his team 's smaller errors his goaltender chris osgood was touch up paint for the dents and scratches but that was one long year ago now the islanders are staggering and osgood can not regain his spot as the team 's top goaltender his goals against average is the worst in the national hockey league and he finds himself thinking instead of reacting you get what you deserve and by no means do i deserve to get ice time the way i 've been playing osgood said today after practice osgood began the day ranked last among 46 nhl goaltenders with a 465 goals against average that is three goals a game more than he was averaging a year ago his save percentage has dropped to 793 from 943 osgood was as magnificent last season as he has been porous this season but when asked if he had had a more harrowing stretch in his career he said not even close to this the islanders 3 8 1 0 will try to end their five game losing streak thursday at montreal and the only promise laviolette could make today about his lineup was that right wing arron asham a grinder who used to be with the canadiens would be playing i 'm there to create momentum said asham a healthy scratch in the islanders last two games momentum was what osgood provided last season one year ago today following a 3 0 victory over tampa bay he was 10 2 1 with three shutouts he was the league 's player of the month in october osgood who turns 30 on nov 26 helped detroit win the stanley cup in 1998 but he seemed to get as much delight out of simply enabling the islanders to make the playoffs the red wings could cover up his mistakes i feel like when i 'm playing well here the team plays better he said now laviolette does not know or would not say which goaltender will start thursday but he has found himself answering questions about rick dipietro the former no 1 draft choice who plays for the islanders bridgeport conn farm team dipietro is apparently still not an option but osgood is not the islanders no 1 goaltending option either garth snow has been and osgood 's slide has been as unexpected to him as it has been to everyone else around this struggling team you 'd like to think the previous nine years is no fluke laviolette said as recently as three weeks ago laviolette said he was certain that osgood would begin to play better laviolette said today that he would love to have osgood play his way out of his slump but the islanders can not afford many more bad nights in goal from anyone osgood has played only twice in the last two weeks and he allowed two goals in the first 31 seconds of a 6 2 loss to philadelphia and six goals on 32 shots saturday in a loss to st louis he made changes but the changes did not work either i should have stuck to what 's made me successful osgood said today so that is what osgood has decided to do for now he said he was using the technique and the attitude that worked so well at the start of last season but he also said he was not relying on it thinking too much is apparently bad for a goaltender it 's mental he said i 'm just thinking too much it ends up being way too much clutter
