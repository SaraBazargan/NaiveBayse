 senate democrats began a filibuster today speaking on the senate floor without respite to block a vote on president bush 's nomination of miguel estrada to a federal appeals court in washington the democrats said they had not been given enough information to assess his views but they said they believed that he held extreme conservative positions that could tilt the appeals court far to the right for their part republicans responded defiantly talk all you want we wo n't stop you said senator rick santorum of pennsylvania the republican conference chairman but mr santorum warned be prepared to stay here through a planned recess and keep talking congress is out next week for the president 's day recess it remains unclear whether the current procedure will resemble those of old in which filibustering senators engaged in marathon oratorical sessions to to put off a vote but for now other senate business has come to a halt over the nomination of mr estrada a 42 year old washington lawyer named by mr bush to a seat on the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit widely seen as second in importance only to the supreme court with a 51 member majority in the 100 member senate republicans have the votes to confirm mr estrada as the first hispanic judge on the appeals court in washington but they would need at least 9 democrats to reach the 60 votes needed to end the filibuster as the debate wore on today democrats complained repeatedly that mr estrada had refused to answer any questions at his confirmation hearing last year about his views senator tom daschle of south dakota the democratic leader told reporters mr estrada has been intransigent and unwilling to provide even the basic information that we must have if we 're going to make our assessment of his qualifications in a letter to president bush mr daschle asked that mr estrada answer questions to which he declined to respond at his sept 26 hearing like which supreme court opinions he disagreed with and which judges he would use as a model in addition mr daschle asked the white house to provide copies of legal memorandums mr estrada wrote while a lawyer in the office of solicitor general in which he assessed cases the government was arguing before the supreme court the white house has refused to release those documents saying that doing so would discourage government lawyers from providing candid advice for fear that their views might later be disclosed and used against them but mr daschle said until that information is provided we will not be in a position to allow a vote to come to the senate floor president bush complained to reporters today a handful of democrats in the senate are playing politics with his nomination and it 's shameful politics he said he wanted mr estrada to get fairer treatment than he 's getting from those who are really against the spirit of the united states senate senator orrin g hatch the utah republican who is chairman of the judiciary committee said the contention that mr estrada was not responsive at his hearing was laughable he said democrats real problem was that his answers did n't give them any reason to oppose him mr hatch added he testified that he would follow binding precedent and that nothing in his personal views would interfere with his ability to follow the law most judicial candidates decline to discuss many of their personal views but mr estrada was a little more reticent than most saying he could not discuss some well known cases because he had not read the briefs or heard the oral arguments mr hatch also noted that mr estrada had argued 15 cases before the supreme court and that his candidacy had received high marks from the american bar association senator charles e schumer the new york democrat who has been leading the effort to block a vote on the estrada nomination said the filibuster transcended mr estrada the issue he said is whether the advise and consent process in the selection of judges is going to be obliterated the situation carries political perils for both sides democrats have seized on mr estrada as an example of mr bush 's efforts to pack the courts with conservative judges republicans have begun to try to portray democrats as standing in the way of the advancement of an accomplished hispanic lawyer
