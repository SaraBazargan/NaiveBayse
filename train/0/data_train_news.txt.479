 the four men gathered one night last month at a restaurant in vero beach fla over a meal of steak pasta and red wine they had become friends over the years and their discussions transcended shop talk but in this instance they knew the conversation would quickly turn to the art of pitching sandy koufax al leiter tom glavine and john franco were the four who met for dinner that night a sort of roundtable of lefties with decades of success on the mound as the dinner wore on it became clear to three of them what they had truly united for to razz leiter koufax the hall of famer has long implored leiter to pitch away from hitters but it was not until glavine arrived in february for his first spring training with the mets that leiter began trying to mimic glavine 's signature changeup leiter focused so much on incorporating that pitch into his repertory of cut fastballs that when koufax later visited the mets camp he chided leiter for listening to glavine after koufax had been telling him the same thing for years most of us were bashing al glavine recalled with a smile al was the black sheep of the table glavine will need that kind of humor to overcome days like monday when his first start for the mets deteriorated into a 15 2 season opening loss to the chicago cubs leiter will try to turn things around for the mets when he pitches the second game of the season tonight through trying times this year the two can probably refer back to that dinner for perspective and support the dinner was clearly an exclusive event koufax leiter glavine and franco did not need to post a no right handers sign on the door to the restaurant they sat in the main dining room of one of koufax 's favorite haunts the three mets pitchers did not reveal the name of the restaurant for fear of jeopardizing koufax 's well guarded privacy occasionally taking breaks to sign autographs what took place that night no doubt warmed the heart of fred wilpon the mets owner and koufax 's childhood friend wilpon too is a left hander and he pitched for lafayette high school in brooklyn while koufax played first base it is no exaggeration to say that five of the most important and influential people in the mets hierarchy these days are left handed pitchers past and present franco who is also a lafayette alumnus and is currently on the disabled list is the longest tenured met on the roster leiter is right behind him glavine was personally courted by wilpon and koufax is well koufax he has been a regular visitor to the mets camp for years glavine was signed by wilpon to be the ace of the staff and a clubhouse leader he failed on the first count on opening day although it appears he is having no trouble in adjusting to new york less than two hours before monday 's game glavine conducted a television interview by his locker a pregame ritual that starting pitchers usually avoid glavine and leiter give the mets a left leaning top of the rotation similar to the one in 2000 when leiter and mike hampton led the mets to the world series hampton like glavine on monday had trouble getting the ball over the plate in the mets opener that season but he ended up being named the most valuable player of the national league championship series koufax was one of the first people to call glavine last december to congratulate him on signing with the mets acting as a sort of emissary for wilpon and easing the shock for glavine of leaving the braves after 16 years when the mets introduced glavine at a news conference wilpon said that koufax was high on glavine because he thought he had the kind of delivery the kind of arm the kind of stuff that was lasting leiter glavine and franco spoke glowingly as they described that dinner conversation and the three marveled at koufax 's pitching career with the dodgers and appreciated his willingness to offer his help 37 years after he retired at age 31 glavine believes koufax would be a pitching coach if the job did not force him into the public eye franco recalled how koufax spoke at the dinner of how he gripped a baseball where he stood on the mound and how hard he threw his curveball anybody has to be an idiot not to want to sit down and listen to the way he talks and the way he thinks about pitching franco said when you 're sitting there you 're just absorbing everything franco has told koufax how his father was a dodgers fan early in koufax 's career before the team moved from brooklyn to los angeles if he was alive today knowing i was sitting down having a pretty good relationship with sandy he 'd be tickled pink franco said the mets this season can essentially provide a left handed tutor for virtually every type of pitcher franco 42 has more saves 422 than any other left hander and he has done it mostly with a changeup glavine 37 forces hitters to lean for his changeup or his sinker like koufax glavine is a believer in living outside as leiter calls it koufax 67 threw very hard and away using his curveball to change speeds leiter 37 who picked up the check that night throws harder than glavine or franco and is a rarity a left hander who throws inside his cut fastball breaks bats and backs off hitters and because his body is so conditioned to throwing cutters leiter said he needs to change his entire mind set to throw to the other side of the plate the three mets pitchers considered themselves fortunate to have dinner with koufax but the really lucky mets might be the pitchers who are young and left handed mike bacsik a left handed reliever said he has spoken with leiter on throwing inside with franco on the changeup and with glavine on setting up hitters if he could throw a curveball like koufax bacsik said he would be truly successful it 's like taking the advanced classes instead of the basic classes said bacsik who had a rough outing in the mets opener as for wilpon he said he has never asked koufax to assist with the mets that koufax offers his time voluntarily i think the distinguishing difference about this group of people is they are able to share their knowledge wilpon said of koufax leiter franco and glavine of the younger left handers on the team wilpon said if you 're smart you do a lot of listening
