 mets general manager steve phillips spoke to the news media by telephone yesterday but the only announcement was a minor league transaction that shrunk the mets 40 man roster to 36 the mets have open spots and offers to pitchers to fill them but the coming weekend may be tense for the national league champions they have re signed only one player the reserve lenny harris and could lose their setup man john franco to the phillies who are growing anxious about whether he will accept their two year 9 million offer starter rick reed and reliever turk wendell two players who want to return to the mets also remain unsigned and the ace mike hampton is being heavily courted by 10 teams with the chicago cubs a strong contender i do n't think you can ever anticipate anything phillips said just as these players are competitive on the field they 're going to be competitive in the marketplace i do n't think anybody is going to hand themselves over for nothing then phillips joked about wendell 's fanciful offer to play free or with his salary donated to charity if he signs a three year deal as the cubs and the mets have offered him there is not much else to joke about phillips is spending most of his time on free agents but that market has been frustrating with talks with reed and hampton stalled and the free agent bobby j jones apparently still a lesser priority the mets have no reliable starters besides al leiter and glendon rusch at this point a trade would be a fallback phillips said a deal for a starter like montreal 's dustin hermanson who is available would probably happen later i could make a couple of deals now but i 've got to see where the free agent market goes with ours as well as others phillips said denny neagle remains a possibility for the mets who surely remember his eight solid years in the national league more than his struggles for the yankees down the stretch last season while not acknowledging if the mets have made an offer neagle 's agent barry meister was enthusiastic about the mets as a possibility i think they 're still a good fit meister said yesterday we do n't know exactly how it 'll tumble out but we 're hoping to do something by next week we have definite interest in them we 'll keep talking to all clubs and winnow things down in the next 7 to 10 days neagle could command 10 million a year as could another free agent darren dreifort of the dodgers who has interested the mets in the past the former met right hander armando reynoso of the diamondbacks is another free agent who could emerge as a less expensive option while pitching is dominating the mets attention they are also trying to acquire a left handed hitter milwaukee 's jeromy burnitz may be available in a trade but he wants a big contract extension florida outfielder henry rodriguez heads a thin free agent crowd of productive left handed hitters the best hitter on the market of course is seattle shortstop alex rodriguez a right handed batter there is some thought in baseball that the mets may try to reopen negotiations covertly but the mets public withdrawal last week wounded rodriguez 's feelings and it is highly unlikely that he would consider them again publicly the mets say that feeling is mutual i do n't anticipate anything that would change that would make us reconsider it phillips said the delay in franco 's decision may be a good sign for the mets the phillies have made it clear to franco that he is their first choice to turn around their bullpen but baseball officials indicated that the phillies may be close to giving him a deadline for a decision if franco does not sign with the phillies they will probably go with a closer by committee the mets have offered franco two years and 7 million according to one official and they apparently will not match the phillies offer franco would close games in philadelphia but set up saves in flushing closers salaries are different than setup men 's salaries phillips said everything being equal i would think johnny would stay here but things are n't equal because of the role inside pitch the san diego padres claimed the right handed pitcher jason middlebrook off waivers from the mets yesterday the mets had claimed him off waivers from the padres last month
