 there are physical maulings and then there is what giants defensive end michael strahan did for much of yesterday afternoon against st louis offensive tackle ryan tucker strahan has an assortment of moves but right now his best one seems to be the all out bull rush it is a pure power move in which the massive strahan uses brute strength to shove his opponent backward strahan overpowered the 305 pound tucker so badly once that he almost bumped into quarterback kurt warner pushed like a plate of food across the dinner table warner was nearly knocked down without strahan 's even touching him in the second half the rams began sending two players to block strahan hoping a double team would finally stop him from disrupting their pretty offense still strahan wreaked havoc once stripping warner of the football strahan who had the single best day for a defensive lineman in the nfl thus far this season with six tackles four sacks one pass knocked down and one forced fumble exemplified the giants relentlessness in all phases of the game giants players punished rams players on the giants first possession ron dayne ran over free safety kim herring as if the 200 pound defensive back were a lilliputian warner was not tackled he was pounded all game marshall faulk whose quickness is normally like armor against big hits was hit hard once by safety sam garnes and another time by linebacker mike barrow who forced a fumble guard glenn parker steamrolled safety adam archuleta while pulling on a running play this past week giants coaches and players talked about one thing when preparing for the rams nuclear offense let 's try to physically intimidate them yeah that was an intense game said tucker who played with a broken hand and an injured shoulder the giants have a good defense and they were doing some serious hitting warner was sacked 6 times and hit 16 times by late in the second half he was visibly flustered faulk who is probably the best player in the sport wobbled off the field late in the third quarter after being hit by nine giants almost at once forcing him to fumble he sustained a bone bruise in his right knee did not play in the fourth quarter and will miss next week 's game against the jets then strahan and kenny holmes knocked warner out of the game in the fourth quarter with a combined hit which knocked the wind out of him even the giants coaches got into the act when cornerback dexter mccleon was doing a little too much trash talking near the giants sideline the linebackers coach tom olivadotti screamed at him to shut up olivadotti later had to be restrained by another assistant charles way after he began yelling at an official after the controversial pass interference penalty against garnes that led to the rams winning score st louis did win 15 14 but in many ways this was a victory for the giants because their hard fought effort may have dispelled what seemed to be constant whispers by other teams that they are overrated i get tired of what people say about us coach jim fassel said strahan said this defense is getting better and more confident every week no one gave us a chance because their offense is so high powered but our defense is n't bad either it has been some time since the giants physically dominated a super bowl contender this way on the road john fox 's schemes were brilliant as usual limiting the rams to 41 yards rushing and 87 fewer total yards than their 402 yard average but it was the attitude of the giants players that almost won this game that attitude became more stubborn with each hit with each rams star sent limping off in two games against st louis the past two seasons the giants had been beaten by 69 34 and gave up 809 yards then they did not have the talent or the attitude to keep up with the rams this time the giants had both and decided to do the bullying especially strahan when asked what he thought of the play of the giants defense warner replied way too much strahan strahan 's abuse of the rams continued after the game tucker did give strahan credit for being a good player but then suggested that strahan had beaten him so badly because of his injuries in the nfl nothing gets a player more fired up than hearing another player make excuses told of tucker 's remarks strahan said well maybe we 'll meet down the road and he 'll be healthy then let 's see what happens
