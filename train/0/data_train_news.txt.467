 to the editor the portrayal of dogs up for adoption in the essay by laurie lico albanese soapbox dec 16 was quite disturbing it 's too bad she would never consider adopting a pit bull a three legged mongrel or any dog that snorts her way through a walk or would so rudely show no interest in her as with any dog a properly trained and loved pit bull can be a wonderful pet and also like any dog if it is taught to be vicious and violent it will be just that i wonder if ms albanese ever thought how that three legged mongrel became three legged or of the pain it endured when it lost its leg as for the dog that snorted when she walked it did she ever stop to think about the ailment or the discomfort the dog must experience when it expends energy i do n't blame any dog for not showing interest in her as she complains sharing your life with a dog is not a cheap antidote to the anxiety of uncertain times it is a wonderful addition to any life as well as a beautiful example for our children of the giving and receiving of unconditional love i hope for her sake that she never loses her looks and becomes one of those mongrels she feels is unworthy of love ellie fried short hills
