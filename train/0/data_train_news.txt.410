 for the nets to visit the compaq center and have their victory plans foiled by a houston rockets big man is nothing new hakeem olajuwon one of the greatest centers in the history of the game has been doing that for years but for the final 20 minutes of today 's tight and tense contest the 37 year old olajuwon was on the bench with asthma like symptoms even so the rockets inside dominance continued as olajuwon 's understudy kelvin cato turned a game that seemed to be evolving into a nets victory into a costly defeat cato a 6 foot 11 inch center who averages 88 points and 61 rebounds a game eclipsed his scoring average in the last 6 minutes 25 seconds scoring 9 of his 11 points grabbing 4 of his 7 rebounds and recording 3 of his 5 blocks in that span cato led the rockets to a 99 92 overtime victory over the nets his biggest basket came on a ferocious two handed dunk with the nets rookie evan eschmeyer draped over his shoulders with 1 03 left in overtime just a 61 percent foul shooter cato sank the ensuing free throw to give the rockets a 95 92 lead that the nets would never cut into kelvin cato came up with some big dunks nets forward kendall gill said i think he was the key toward the end that was it right there those two words his name cato 's performance stalled the ascent of the nets who were led by stephon marbury 's 35 points and 6 assists in the eastern conference playoff race with 2 42 left in the fourth quarter the nets 24 35 led by 5 points and looked to be headed back to new jersey with at least three road victories now they must upset the defending champion san antonio spurs on monday to finish the five game trip above 500 while cato took advantage of eschmeyer at the end the nets rookie played admirably grabbing a career best nine rebounds and blocking two shots in 28 minutes his large amount of playing time was the result of a lower back bruise that limited jim mcilvaine to 12 minutes though coach don casey and the nets praised eschmeyer 's overall performance eschmeyer was disappointed after kerry kittles 17 points failed to answer cato 's 3 point play by missing a 13 footer with 463 seconds left eschmeyer fouled cuttino mobley near halfcourt it was eschmeyer 's sixth foul and sent casey into a rage because casey did not want the nets to foul in that situation mobley one of six rockets in double figures with 14 points made both free throws to make it 97 92 we 're not going to foul then casey said i do n't know where he got it in his mind he 's not a designated fouler anyway he just brain locked when you 've got five you do n't foul but he was confused and he 's a rookie but for a rookie he did a pretty good job eschmeyer said we had every chance to win and obviously i was involved in a big play down the stretch i messed up i cost us big down the stretch i 've been playing the game my whole life and i should know better than that the nets should have put houston 24 35 away in regulation they struggled early but marbury who shot 14 of 26 from the field on the strength of 10 layups kept them in it with 27 points through three quarters keith van horn 24 points 12 rebounds and kittles provided help in the fourth quarter with 6 points apiece and the nets held two 6 point leads in the final eight minutes but after hitting their first 16 free throws they missed 3 of their last 6 in the fourth quarter marbury made 1 of 2 foul shots to put the nets ahead 82 77 with 2 42 left but confusion in their defensive rotations left shandon anderson open for a 3 pointer then gill missed a jumper and the rockets tied the game on two free throws by kenny thomas behind cato houston took an 86 84 lead when marbury missed a 3 pointer on the next possession the nets seemed through but eschmeyer grabbed the rebound and fed marbury who drove to hit a 6 foot running jumper with 15 seconds left to send the game into overtime the nets led by 90 88 early in the extra session but cato who was 3 of 3 from the foul line had 5 points as the rockets finished with an 11 2 run rebounds coach rudy tomjanovich who led the rockets to national basketball association titles in 1994 and 1995 had a four year contract extension made official before the game the extension will begin in the 2001 2002 season the nets were outrebounded by 53 37 but jamie feick the team 's leading rebounder played only 13 minutes and had one rebound
