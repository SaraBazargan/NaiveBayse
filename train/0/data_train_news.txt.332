 as st john 's met with national collegiate athletic association investigators yesterday about erick barkley 's qualifying sat his prep school coach talked about how the test was administered max good barkley 's coach at maine central institute said that barkley took the sat on which he received a qualifying score at st thomas more a prep school in connecticut during a trip to a tournament maine central players regularly took the sat there good said because the test date usually fell during the annual tournament there were discussions today st john 's athletic director ed manetta jr said of the investigation we 're hopeful that this will bring to closure the ncaa inquiry good is angered by the ncaa 's investigation into barkley which expanded last week to include looking at the circumstances surrounding how his sat was administered barkley took the first test in which he failed to score 800 at maine central two months later after three hour tutoring sessions with a math instructor that occasionally made him miss practice good said barkley improved his score by 40 or 50 points to qualify his score was not exaggerated good said it was n't 1300 erick worked for everything he got i 'll bet you 10 against my salary that they will find nothing on that sat we did n't even take them to the test i do n't know how there would be anything there the first one he took he came up a little short and he was so distressed he went in his room and would n't come out i guarantee you they will find nothing on that sat it aggravates me to have to discuss it
