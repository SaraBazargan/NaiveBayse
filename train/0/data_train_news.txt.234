 it wo n't be easy but baseball has to find a way to crack down on steroids which more and more big leaguers appear to be using every year and which could threaten to turn the game into a freak show mark mcgwire has used steroids this is now clear to any person who looks at the facts about androstenedione the testosterone booster mcgwire was taking two seasons ago when he broke roger maris 's single season home run record it 's a steroid that 's what most scientists say and what the government will most likely say sometime soon gen barry r mccaffrey the white house 's drug policy director used a speech to the citizenship through sports alliance at the end of june to say he thinks androstenedione will be classified by the government as a steroid within a few months the international olympic committee already classifies andro as an anabolic steroid its medical director patrick schamasch told me in a phone interview last month that major league baseball should have banned andro long ago but andro is only the beginning of the story the drug was first isolated by european scientists in the 1930 's but it was developed in the 1980 's by the east german sports machine it was used as a so called bridging drug to tide east german athletes over when they had to stop taking other steroids before testing at competitions andro and other steroids went together then and in all likelihood they go together now if steroids once seemed like the recourse of a few power hitters those days are long gone pitchers add around four to six miles an hour on their fastballs infielders once known only for their gloves bulk up enough to inflate their home run totals and of course the big men get bigger that 's why we are very likely to see more incidents like the recent discovery of vials of steroids and syringes in a car belonging to boston infielder manny alexander though he was n't driving it at the time the police discovered the illegal goods baseball is investigating whether the steroids belonged to alexander baseball will most likely ban androstenedione in the near future once a harvard team of researchers completes a fresh study into whether andro can boost athletic performance not just muscle mass some observers have been critical of baseball 's reluctance to take action on andro just after mcgwire 's record setting season but this is an unfair criticism that would have been terrible public relations and no major sport can afford that baseball badly needed the boost it got from mcgwire 's and sammy sosa 's home run show it was clear at the time that baseball would need to wait until a tasteful interval passed before it could take on andro this is the time to act and not just regarding andro but all steroids the players union strenuously opposes testing for steroids so immediate action is not possible but if baseball 's leadership makes a public case between now and the end of next season when a new collective bargaining agreement will be negotiated the players will risk widespread fan outrage if they resist the call for testing the explosion in home runs has become so pronounced baseball officials went to the trouble to have the ball inspected to show that it is n't more lively now than it used to be but even if the ball is n't juiced many players appear to be the fans know that the modern mania of power power power has robbed the summer game of much of the nuance and subtlety that roger angell and roger kahn and so many others have memorably celebrated that 's not to say that chemicals improve hand eye coordination or make connecting with a fastball any easier they ca n't do that hitting a baseball is still the hardest thing in sports but added strength can change what happens once a ball is struck sportswriters talk among themselves constantly about such signs of steroid use as bizarre mood swings and large patches of acne in strange places like the shoulders sometimes so noticeable that players wear dark t shirts under their uniforms sometimes sportswriters even talk with players about steroids usually with those who are n't using them and who resent those who do for the advantage they gain but little is written i covered the oakland athletics for the san francisco chronicle between 1994 and 1998 and wrote countless articles about mcgwire 's plantar fascia the connective tissue at the bottom of his feet but i never wrote any stories raising questions about steroids nor did the five other beat writers covering the team in those years sportswriters in short are part of the problem they have a tough job and anyone who has covered a pro team week in and week out through a long season knows that good judgment dictates not needlessly alienating players you need to do your stories that means it is unlikely that many beat writers will report on steroid use even though more and more baseball old timers are horrified at what 's happening to the game not only have the game 's fundamental skills been sacrificed for power but baseball 's oldest records also risk becoming devalued some hall of famers believe it ca n't come from me because it sounds like sour grapes but yes it 's disturbing one player in the hall of fame recently told the arizona republic columnist pedro gomez it taints all of us who got here because we earned it the right way it taints what hank aaron and willie mays and every one of us did to reach 500 home runs why do you think some of these guys are constantly hurt their muscles are too big for their ligaments and tendons it 's obvious who is on the stuff you do n't need to be a scientist or specialist to know just look at these guys what 's striking about steroid use in baseball and in other popular arenas is not just how widespread it seems to have become but how much public acceptance it seems to have gained professional wrestling in which bodies puffed up absurdly by steroids are both mocked and celebrated has gained an ever higher profile in recent years almost egging on baseball players many of whom love to watch professional wrestling even in the clubhouse steroids do not just pump up athletes bodies into grotesque shapes sacrificing suppleness to gain more raw power they are also dangerous liver failure heart trouble and cancer all lurk as potential consequences of heavy sustained steroid use players calculate that it 's worth the risk to pump up their numbers along with their bodies and make more money while they can but it 's doubtful many of them are fully aware of the risks they are taking unlike the national football league which has had limited success in reducing steroid use major league baseball does not test for steroids this policy may well have made sense back when steroid use was an anomaly now that bulking up with chemical help seems to be more popular than ever it 's incumbent on baseball to take action baseball has enough problems it can not afford to be passive on steroids and wait until the problem gets so out of hand that a player in a 'roid rage does something awful and the dark secret finally becomes a full fledged national controversy backtalk steve kettmann covered the last two world series
