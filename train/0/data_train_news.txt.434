 the mets responded yesterday to the counteroffer made by tom glavine 's agent with one of their own but they were behind before they even picked up the phone after glavine 's agent gregg clifton delivered his first proposal to the mets the phillies and the braves on tuesday requesting a four year deal for 45 million the phillies responded that night by calling clifton to increase their offer in both value and length the phillies proposal initially for three years and 27 million is now at three years and 30 million plus a 10 million option based on innings pitched a person familiar with the negotiations said that makes the phillies the front runners for glavine a 36 year old free agent left hander as far as guaranteed money is concerned and continues their willingness to set the market for free agents the mets revised offer delivered yesterday by their assistant general manager jim duquette was for three years and 285 million the same as their original proposal plus an option for 95 million in the fourth year also based on innings pitched the braves have not budged from their last offer a two year contract for about the same annual value as the mets and the phillies initial offers plus an option for a third year as of yesterday afternoon clifton had not heard from braves general manager john schuerholz since monday tom is excited because both teams have four year proposals clifton said of the phillies and the mets terming the options involving a fourth year a major step forward the mets were wondering what the phillies would do next having signed the free agent third baseman david bell to join a cadre of young players and with a new stadium opening in 2004 the phillies do not appear to have a limit to their budget essentially spending the money they would have committed to third baseman scott rolen before he was traded to st louis in july the phillies have offered a six year deal to the free agent first baseman jim thome in the range of 80 million to 85 million thome was deciding between that and the indians offer which was said to be for five years and 60 million thome has played his entire career with the indians and he may wait until next week to make a decision the mets afraid the phillies are driving up the market even though prices for free agents seem to be declining are unsure how long they can stay in the glavine hunt the mets owner fred wilpon who declined to comment on glavine yesterday has made signing him his priority this off season but clifton has made it clear he wants a fourth year for glavine who will be 40 at the start of that season if the phillies were to change the option into a guaranteed fourth season it is doubtful the mets would follow one person familiar with the mets plans said last night the mets and the phillies had both feared that glavine 's desire was to remain in atlanta and that he was negotiating to bring the braves offer in line with those of the mets and the phillies clifton has stressed that glavine will not take less money to remain with the braves the only team he has pitched for in his 16 year career meaning the braves are not even the mets greatest worry at least for now he 's told me from the beginning there 's no discount to the atlanta braves clifton said can i swear if there was a gun to my head what he would do if it comes right down to it who knows in a statement acknowledging a counteroffer from glavine the mets said we expect to hear back from them sometime after the holidays mets general manager steve phillips is due back from a cruise tonight and clifton said he would probably contact the mets and the phillies tomorrow clifton said neither team termed its proposal a final offer and he said that glavine could make his decision next week the mets option would kick in if glavine reached a certain number of innings in the third year of the contract or a combined number over the three years philadelphia 's option could be reached in either the final year or over the final two years inside pitch while waiting to learn if they will sign tom glavine and to see what offers the free agent third baseman edgardo alfonzo receives from other teams steve phillips met recently at shea stadium with the agent for the free agent third baseman norihiro nakamura of the kintetsu buffaloes of japan nakamura turned down an offer yesterday from the yomiuri giants after the team shifted its attention to signing first baseman roberto petagine to replace the free agent hideki matsui the kyodo news service reported nakamura has expressed interest in playing in america but kintetsu and the hanshin tigers are both interested in him and he is likely to command more money in japan than in the major leagues
