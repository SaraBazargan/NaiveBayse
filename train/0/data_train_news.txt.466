 jerrod riggan has kept a diary since the first week of march recording his experiences and putting his spiritual beliefs in writing riggan a rookie right hander for the mets will one day reflect on his entries from this week in houston where he lost two extra inning games for the first decisions of his big league career the pages will describe the first lessons in losing of a young player 's major league life armando benitez blew the save in the ninth inning tonight and riggan lost the game in the 10th when moises alou rolled a single up the middle to give the astros a 4 3 victory at enron field all three games in the series lasted 10 innings and craig biggio scored the winning run against riggan tonight and tuesday the mets won wednesday 's game in the moments after the game riggan grasped the lesson he would learn from this week telling himself that losses like these would make him stronger in his diary he said he planned to write good things come to those who wait but knowing that did not soothe him tonight right now it 's like getting dragged by your feet across gravel he said you feel like you let down 24 people the mets think highly of riggan and he is pitching in the late innings because the mets traded the veteran turk wendell to the philadelphia phillies last week riggan has been called up from class aaa norfolk five times this year and even with wendell gone he knows he must perform to stay i 'll just have to rise above it i guess and hopefully get another chance he said biggio who homered off riggan on tuesday led off the 10th tonight with a single and went to second on a sacrifice bunt riggan walked jeff bagwell intentionally and nearly got out of the inning when lance berkman grounded to short for a potential inning ending double play but the ball was hit softly and second baseman edgardo alfonzo could not get a good grip on the ball as he hurried his relay throw and bounced it in front of first baseman todd zeile but berkman had crossed first by then even if i made a strong throw to first it was going to be close alfonzo said alou then grounded a slider up the middle past riggan whose delivery pulls him off the mound toward first alfonzo knocked the ball down and tried to throw to second while on his back for an inning ending force out but he never got a throw off biggio scored and the astros won benitez had a chance to close out the game and get a victory for steve trachsel who allowed only three hits and one run over seven innings benitez converted his first 24 save opportunities this season but he blew the save sunday and again tonight i feel real sorry for trachsel benitez said he threw a real good game for seven innings i come in i do n't do my job today no excuse benitez allowed a leadoff single in the ninth to bagwell then walked berkman alou then fell behind 0 2 but fouled off two pitches and drew a walk to load the bases benitez almost always withers with the bases loaded and he did so again daryle ward struck out looking but pinch hitter orlando merced pulled a double to right field scoring two runs to tie the game at 3 3 an intentional walk loaded the bases again but an unwise base running decision got the mets out of the inning jose vizcaino flied out to shallow left and alou tagged up challenging tsuyoshi shinjo 's strong arm shinjo who made a running basket catch with his back to home plate in the fourth threw a one hop strike that arrived well before alou who was tagged out to end the inning still over the last two years opposing hitters are 7 for 12 with four homers off benitez with the bases loaded in that situation i try to be focused and make my pitches benitez said i got a chance to get a fly ball and got out of the inning the mets scored all of their runs off pedro astacio who made his debut for the astros after coming over in a deal from colorado on tuesday 's trading deadline nelson cruz and mike williams 3 4 shut down the mets for two and two thirds innings the outcome took the attention off trachsel who has a 329 earned run average in 10 starts since returning from class aaa norfolk in june he is 3 0 with a 157 era in four starts since the all star game break trachsel has turned around his season and other players have two months to do the same riggan has pitched in 16 games and has mostly pitched well but he is also searching he will write out his thoughts and read the words of others riggan said he was reading the book secrets of success i have n't started it yet he said inside pitch the mets have played three consecutive extra inning games for the first time since aug 18 20 1982 they had not played three extra inning games in a row against the same team since may 5 7 1980 against the cincinnati reds
