 the rangers would have felt good about themselves had they simply tied the philadelphia flyers at madison square garden last night instead the rangers wound up feeling ecstatic with new york trailing by a goal little theo fleury sent the game into overtime at 17 minutes 8 seconds of the third period fleury then won it 2 46 into the extra session while being tackled by mark recchi fleury scored while bowling over philadelphia goalie roman cechmanek fleury 's second goal of the evening and 26th of the season gave the rangers a 4 3 triumph over the flyers marking the first time in the 16 games this season that the rangers have rallied to win after trailing going into the final period fleury 's heroics saved mike richter who was fairly solid for most of the evening but who allowed a particularly soft goal to eric desjardins that gave the flyers a 3 2 lead with less than six minutes left in regulation the victory was the 266th of richter 's career tying him with ed giacomin for the most in franchise history he has now won consecutive games for the first time since dec 6 and 8 maybe this will snap him out of it coach ron low said of the struggling richter who made 31 saves we have to bail him out once in a while he 's going to bail us out too fleury who will represent the rangers at next month 's all star game with brian leetch did much of the bailing out last night that was probably my best game as a ranger said fleury who had 4 points on the evening finally a big goal that was the thing that had bothered me most when i 've scored they have n't been real real big goals that has been the one thing that has been lacking in my game the timing of my goals i 've got 26 and only 2 are game winners that 's what you want to do go out and score the big goals the rangers had plenty of reasons to feel good about their performance they scored a power play goal for one thing they were also able to shake off a power play goal they scored on themselves they fought back from a two goal second period deficit then from desjardins 's seemingly crushing goal right now any point is a good point for us said mark messier who turns 40 tomorrow and who celebrated last night with a pair of assists messier was speaking about the standing not snapping a nine game pointless drought that was the longest of his 22 year national hockey league career richter found himself trailing by 2 0 just 5 01 into the second period when the flyers scored on consecutive shots the first was actually taken by leetch who pushed a rebound back toward richter hoping that his goalie would smother it instead the puck slid beneath richter hit rick tocchet 's skate and went in at 4 44 just 17 seconds later paul ranheim fired a one timer past richter a shot from above the right wing circle that may have deflected off messier it remained 2 0 until late in the period when the rangers finally received a break of their own it came when a messier centering pass was blocked the puck caromed out to tomas kloucek above the left wing circle and he threw it on net with a seemingly harmless shot and was rewarded with his first nhl goal at 18 09 of the second period the rangers tied the score at 2 2 midway through the third period from an unlikely source their moribund power play which had not scored at the garden in nearly a month the rangers had not scored anywhere on their power play in their last 30 chances but with just seconds left before it was about to turn 31 fleury made a nice play to keep the puck in the zone at the blue line he passed to leetch who skated down the left wing boards before reversing the puck back to fleury with a no look pass fleury 's shot from the left circle struck cechmanek on his right shoulder the rebound plopped down in the low slot giving radek dvorak just enough time to bat it in off cechmanek 's skate at 9 51 but desjardins somehow beat richter from the right wing boards above the right circle richter had seen the shot all the way but he tried like a matador to flick the shot away with his stick richter missed the puck went through his legs all the life was sucked out of the garden and at 13 04 the flyers had retaken the lead but then fleury saved the day
