 the mets are getting outstanding pitching from their rotation and their bullpen their hits have been well timed their defense is sparkling the mets took another game from the arizona diamondbacks tonight 6 2 and they have won 10 of their last 11 to move three games behind the first place atlanta braves in the national league east that is the closest to first place the mets have been since the all star game break and it would take a drastic blow to sour their spirits that almost happened tonight when catcher mike piazza had to leave the game in the fourth inning piazza sprained his left knee while crossing first base on a close play in the fourth he came back to the field to catch in the bottom of the inning but his mobility was limited and he was removed before bobby jones 's first pitch of the inning piazza has missed games this year because of a home plate collision a backswing and a beanball but it is not known if the knee injury will force him from the lineup x rays taken at bank one ballpark were negative and the mets listed piazza day to day while piazza was being examined the mets were finishing off the diamondbacks in the second game of this series and extending their winning streak over arizona to seven games dating to the division series last fall jones worked six effective innings allowing two runs eight hits and two walks to improve to 6 5 removing the rookie grant roberts 's rough start in a cameo role the mets starters are 8 1 with a 225 earned run average over the last 11 games jones who had tossed a complete game in his previous start continued his impressive turnaround in nine starts since a mid june stint at class aaa norfolk jones is 5 2 with a 303 era for arizona the 27 year old geraldo guzman was making the fifth major league start of an improbable career that started in the montreal expos system in 1989 guzman was released after injuring his shoulder the following season and he spent the next seven years working as a carpenter in his native dominican republic a diamondbacks scout suggested he take up baseball again and the club eventually invited him to its dominican academy from there guzman joined a team in taiwan played winter ball in the dominican republic and so impressed the diamondbacks that they signed him and added him to their 40 man roster guzman started this season in the bullpen at class aa el paso and made it to the majors before the all star game break he was 3 1 in his first four starts with arizona the mets knew little of him before the game but they figured him out instantly the first four hitters singled bringing in two runs but guzman set down the next three hitters and after issuing a leadoff walk in the second he was helped when jones failed to get a bunt down guzman recorded a pair of strikeouts to get out of the second and also struck out two in the third he got two quick outs in the fourth then did something no pitcher has done this season he walked jones the mets right hander was 0 for 25 this season with no walks but he took four consecutive balls from guzman then took two bases when lenny harris singled to right with runners at the corners derek bell lined a double to left over the head of luis gonzalez who hesitated before going back on the ball the hit brought in jones and edgardo alfonzo then singled home another run to put the mets ahead 4 1 piazza came up and grounded sharply down the third base line matt williams a four time gold glove winner fielded it four steps into foul territory then rifled a throw across the infield to cut down piazza piazza crossed the bag at full speed then dropped to a squat for a moment and briefly protested the call he came out to catch in the bottom of the fourth but had to leave the field before a pitch was thrown replacing piazza was todd pratt whose home run clinched the mets division series victory over arizona last october there were 41656 fans at bank one ballpark tonight but incredibly none seemed to react when pratt 's name was announced but if fans at the 3 year old stadium do not often boo they had nothing but cheers for randy johnson when he was pulled in the fourth inning of friday 's game after allowing five runs on eight hits they do appreciate great plays with two outs in the sixth bell smoked a pitch just to the right of center field steve finley sprinted for it then stretched his arm and snared the ball just before reaching the wall about 410 feet from home plate finley trotted in to an extended ovation then earned more cheers when he pulled a curveball from jones inside the right field foul pole leading off the bottom of the inning the homer was finley 's 28th of the season and snapped a 20 game homerless streak it cut the mets lead to 4 2 the mets widened their lead to 6 2 in the seventh when robin ventura lined a two run homer
