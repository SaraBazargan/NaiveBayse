 during the bleakest of football seasons in new york the echoes of two teams gone awry bounce off each other jets coach herman edwards observes giants coach jim fassel 's excruciating season and empathizes it is a small fraternity of coaches who work in the national football league and an even more rarefied group that walks the tightrope in new york so with both teams at 4 7 perhaps only edwards can truly feel fassel 's pain even if edwards 's job is not in jeopardy jim handles it the best way he knows how edwards said you hate to see good coaches go through this but we all do they 're going to do it to me they did it to tom landry when times get bad they forget all the good things you have ever done he 's a good football coach and he will coach again whether it 's with the giants or whoever it may be he took that team to the super bowl he has been in the playoffs and they still have an opportunity to go to the playoffs although edwards is safe after making the playoffs his first two years as the jets coach this season has taken a toll on him his hair has more gray and he has looked haggard particularly during the team 's 0 4 start edwards was angered when after the team began 0 3 the jets owner woody johnson said that he thought the team had as much talent or more than any other team in the league on friday when asked to reflect on the loss of four free agent players to the washington redskins in the off season edwards again lamented the jets inability to keep their players noting that the team lost chemistry as well as personnel edwards is in danger of not going to the playoffs for only the third time since he became a coach in 1992 if the jets win their last five games a tall order considering they play tennessee 9 2 on monday night and still have new england and miami on the schedule they will finish 9 7 the same record they had last season that would seem a remarkable accomplishment considering the jets lost chad pennington for six games and started the season 2 6 but it will not be enough for edwards to consider this a successful season the only season that can be considered a success he says is one that ends with a super bowl victory you do n't just play these games to say we had a winning year he said if you do n't win it all that 's what i look at i 've only played in one i have never won one to me that 's a successful season you are not playing for anything else edwards has never heard fans chanting for his firing as fassel has but he sometimes describes the call to coaching as something that sounds like an affliction earlier this season when edwards was asked about 62 year old bill parcells 's return to coaching edwards 49 said he could not imagine himself coaching at 60 we are a weird lot edwards said something is wrong with all of us when you win a game you 're satisfied from the time you walk off the field into the tunnel you see your players eyes you see the elation everyone has they are all excited because you just accomplished something you feel great you talk to the press nicely because you won and you leave the locker room and when you sit on that bus then you start thinking about next week that 's how long it is and i always ask myself 'why do you do this what is wrong with you son you are smarter than this your gut always hurts on that bus ride from that stadium back here my mind is already on 'what 's my speech monday edwards said it was very hard when you 're not going through a winning year he added you think 'that cloud is not coming over my door but it does and then you find out how you handle it i am learning how to handle it if we do n't go to the playoffs we are going to get something good out of it you ca n't think you go unscathed and think it 's not going to happen to you because it happens to everybody he only has to look to fassel for proof extra points defensive end john abraham who is doubtful for monday 's game with an aggravation of the groin strain that caused him to miss three games said he was not sure if he would be able to play again this season i would like to play abraham said i 'm not going to try to rush back before i was worried about getting back on the field now i 'm worried about getting healthy titans quarterback steve mcnair who has an injured right calf will be evaluated a few hours before kickoff monday to determine whether he will be able to play if he ca n't bill volek will make his first career start
