 welcome to fred wilpon 's used car lot as i 'm sure you know the polite name for supposedly as good as new automobiles these days is preowned but this dealership likes to be truthful our motto is by any other name a used car is a used car is a used car so thanks for stopping by mr wilpon 's lot here at shea stadium where we keep trying to turn back the odometers no such luck all our cars are on display here again after last week 's tour of st louis and milwaukee but they did n't sell there either mr wilpon thought the new orange paint jobs would help but they have n't and please do n't kick the tires they might go flat out there on the mound is mr wilpon 's best buy maybe his only buy even on a four year 36 million lease deal it 's a 37 year old rolls royce glavine still purring the way it did with its original owner in atlanta in the glove compartment you 'll find directions to cooperstown over there behind the plate is a ferrari piazza also with directions to cooperstown but it 's got transmission problems and maybe it 's in the wrong position on the lot if you 're looking for a lincoln navigator suv the v is for vaughn we had one but it 's up on the rack with an arthritic axle when it was new a decade ago in fenway it scared everybody on the mass pike but there 's just too much mileage on it now we do have a benitez hummer a closer whose fastball still hums but too often it goes into reverse and that fastball turns into a home run for the other team when that happens all this hummer closes is whatever hope mr wilpon has of anybody buying it here 's an acura alomar also with directions to cooperstown but they 're for what it did in cleveland baltimore toronto and san diego ever since we put it on display here the battery has been dead that cadillac leiter still gets you anywhere you want to go most of the time but every so often it runs out of gas even when the fuel gauge still points above empty must be a slow leak in the tank we 've got a 40 year old lexus cone but it 's up on the rack for an overhaul of its arthritic steering wheel at its age there 's no guarantee it will ever be the same but the boss mr wilpon could n't resist bringing it in here if only to show up that noisy bronx dealer who gave up on it our franco lamborghini is about to come out of the shop but at 42 nobody really knows when it might break down again the boss thought he had a mercedes floyd but it 's had tire trouble we ca n't keep them inflated maybe it 's the wheel covers the boss also thought he had a speedy jaguar cedeno but it just does n't run right in the outfield it runs in circles and just when the boss thought that our buick burnitz was ready to roll into overdrive after acting like a lemon last season it was in a collision only a fender bender but it takes time to smooth out the dents what really hurts is that mr wilpon 's bitter rival the used car dealer in atlanta is already seven sales ahead of us in first place but if you look around used car sales are down in a lot of cities mr wilpon 's dealership got off to a 13 18 start in sales but hey the cincinnati dealer had the same start and the dealers in san diego and milwaukee started off worse over in that other league it 's even worse in detroit where the dealer is going with too many new and untested models off his assembly line he had a 3 25 start before he had another sale by the way the assembly line in our virginia plant is starting to produce new models it 's put a mercury wigginton over there on third base and the boss keeps talking about the new porsche jose reyes that all the scouts rave about but it 's a porsche that has yet to be test driven until it gets here take a look at our subaru sanchez i ca n't talk about those new models too much mr wilpon does n't want the other dealers to know about them well thanks for stopping by if you want to discuss a maintenance warranty with our service manager art howe he 's over there in the dugout and if you 're serious about buying the chief salesman steve phillips is upstairs in his office just between us it might be a good idea to see mr phillips today he might not be here tomorrow
