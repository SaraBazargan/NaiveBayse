 call it collusion call it a market correction juan acevedo has his private suspicions whatever it was that chilled the free agent market this winter he got caught in the middle of it you can say i 've got a chip on my shoulder said acevedo a seven year major league veteran who is in the yankees camp on a minor league deal you can say there 's more fuel to the fire acevedo 32 saved 28 of the detroit tigers 55 victories last season he has worked in 85 games since august 2001 with a 262 earned run average and almost nobody wanted him it was very surprising very upsetting said acevedo a former mets right hander i 'm looking forward to showing some people that they made bad decisions i look at it a couple of ways either they 're going to like me or they 're not going to like me teams that said they liked me did n't have money either they were just trying to save money or not telling the truth the tigers closer 's job belongs to matt anderson who was hurt last season if acevedo had returned to detroit he would have been a setup man we tried to re sign him at the end of the year but he wanted closer money said dave dombrowski the tigers general manager that 's understandable acevedo said he was not looking for 5 million or 6 million a year but he expected to get a two year deal somewhere maybe for 4 million or 5 million total there were encouraging signs jay witasick signed a two year contract with san diego so did brian boehringer with pittsburgh neither of those pitchers saved more than one game let alone half his team 's victories at least acevedo said i did n't make any big purchases this winter acevedo said he had one major league offer but refused it because the team misled him he sorted through six or seven minor league deals and picked the yankees who will pay him 950000 if he plays for them but there are no guarantees we did it without promises general manager brian cashman said we told him 'you know this is the situation trades would have to take place or injuries if everything works out great if you 're willing to come in under those circumstances come on in so acevedo is competing for a spot manager joe torre will have 11 pitchers on the roster and six starters will make it so will the left hander chris hammond and the right handers mariano rivera steve karsay and most likely antonio osuna the left hander randy choate will probably get the last spot the quality of his stuff is way up there and we really like that as well as his experience torre said of acevedo but it comes down to numbers he 'll be around for a while and we 'll see the yankees jeff weaver played with acevedo last season and told acevedo that he was surprised to see him here for him to not get a big league deal it blew my mind weaver said especially when everybody seems to be looking for pitching most teams are now evaluating their own candidates for pitching jobs but as the spring progresses trade talks could pick up san diego for one may seek a closer to replace trevor hoffman who is having shoulder surgery this week and will miss much of the season acevedo can be released at the end of camp if it is clear he will not make the team if he does make the yankees weaver said they will have a solid pitcher his cutter 's phenomenal weaver said he 's got real live stuff the closer 's job was thrown at him and he came in and did a great job when he was on it was pretty much three up three down no questions asked the only question for acevedo is what happened this winter i 'm a guy that works hard plays hurt i 've never had any excuses he said i do n't know you tell me
