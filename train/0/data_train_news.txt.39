 a generation gap apparently must still be bridged on the devils exciting new line left wing patrik elias referred to center joe nieuwendyk recently as mr nieuwendyk as if he were playing next to gordie howe i manage when i play with mr nieuwendyk elias said elias was joking but only a little he holds nieuwendyk nearly 10 years older than elias in high esteem nieuwendyk might have scored 357 more goals than elias in the national hockey league but they have quickly discovered that they play the game in a remarkably similar way we make decisions that are good for the line nieuwendyk said we do n't get ourselves in too much trouble out there add the industrious right wing jamie langenbrunner who often played on the same line with nieuwendyk before the devils acquired them last week from dallas and the devils have a unit that is quick smart and resourceful nieuwendyk 's line had two goals and three assists in a 3 1 victory monday night over florida but there is intrigue line combinations are meant to be broken elias played with jason arnott and petr sykora on the devils a line which stayed together for most of three seasons before arnott was included in the deal for nieuwendyk and langenbrunner sykora came down with the flu last week and has not played since nieuwendyk joined the devils who play the pittsburgh penguins on wednesday night coach kevin constantine who is not much for making commitments said that elias was put on nieuwendyk 's line because there was nowhere else to put him for now we 're still not sure where we want him in the end constantine said of elias a good problem for a coach to have appears to be simmering the devils 33 26 9 4 just 2 points behind the islanders for sixth place in the eastern conference appear to have too many good players nieuwendyk 35 and langenbrunner 26 road roommates with the stars have played even better together in four games with the devils than they did in dallas it 's made a world of difference i 'm sure langenbrunner said of playing next to nieuwendyk the devils best line recently center bobby holik and wings scott gomez and sergei brylin does not appear likely to be broken up that leaves one spot open on the top two lines for elias and sykora and elias has it for now elias was asked if he might really need a big tough center someone like arnott to establish a physical presence he shrugged then said of playing next to nieuwendyk i do n't think we missed anything on the physical side to be honest with you maybe elias said the days of the a line were meant to end because we did n't have the confidence that we 'd had in the last couple of years we threw the puck away instead of hanging on to it elias said besides langenbrunner can supply the grit nieuwendyk fed elias for a goal monday on a beautiful play in which elias faked a slap shot to get florida goaltender trevor kidd out of position then tucked the puck into an open net that goal came on the first shift of the second period on the first shift of the third period nieuwendyk fed elias with a pass through the slot kidd stopped elias but langenbrunner popped in the rebound for the winning goal i think you could put a lot of people with patrik and they 'd feel comfortable nieuwendyk said elias sounds as if he feels the same way about his new linemates even though they may soon become old linemates we 're all on the same page langenbrunner said we want to do the same things with the puck
