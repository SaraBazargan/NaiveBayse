 to the editor re the days of coasting are gone dec 8 which described how the nation 's big airlines may need to find a whole new way of doing business in order to survive consider a recent scene from the new world of travel having braved a long line in security at the fort lauderdale airport a few weeks ago a passenger finally arrived at the barrier only to be sent back to check a bag that did not fit the new stricter rules for carry on luggage the question for the airlines is this will that passenger fly again unless he absolutely has to in a climate of indiscriminate cost cutting produced by the recession and 9 11 airlines seem not to distinguish between two very different types of cost savings the efficiency related for example decreasing the amount of time a jetliner spends on the ground and the service related which effectively lower the quality of the product they sell and are equivalent to price increases since sept 11 the airlines have been saddled with a quality of service reduction namely a tightening in airport security that increases the time and the hassle factor associated with flights amazingly instead of improving service on board to compensate for that they have taken measures to further decrease the quality of their product in addition to the cramped seating there is now no food served on most flights carry on regulations have been tightened and rules on nonrefundable tickets are more strictly enforced i believe airlines also underestimate the elasticity of demand in this case the availability of substitutes for cramped stressful flights at the upper end of the market business travelers are turning to corporate jets and videoconferencing at the lower end there are even more substitutes in a study i published with a colleague at cornell in the mid 80 's we found that when gasoline prices increased people did not cancel vacations but rather substituted holidays close to home for faraway vacations the same seems to be happening now as people substitute road travel for flying s abraham ravid newark dec 10 the writer is a professor of finance and economics at rutgers business school
