 they are at the age where this year could be the last in a baseball career and like two old fishing buddies dangling lines from a pier david cone and paul o'neill have stood in the outfield during batting practice this spring and had big picture conversations about their team and its niche in history as the yankees open the season here monday against the anaheim angels they have a chance to win three consecutive championships something no team has accomplished since the oakland athletics of 1972 74 and something no team has done since the advent of free agency made it more difficult to maintain a dynasty derek jeter is 25 years old and said he has n't thought much about those questions for him winning championships is an annual event you pay your taxes in april and you win a world series in october but o'neill and cone realize they are at a different time and place in their careers and in a sense they have thought about what their professional eulogies will be if you win three straight you put an asterisk by those teams o'neill said i 'd love to be part of one of those and associated with one of those i do n't care how long your career is you could play 15 years but if you could play on a team that wins three championships that 's how you 're going to be remembered cone said we 're both very proud of what 's gone on here and we 're both fiercely proud of the run we 've had i like what 's being said about the yankees it 's a throwback team a selfless group a likable group i just feel good when i hear people say this is a team that 's tough to hate that says a lot because the yankees are very easy to hate but it 's difficult to beat them they are an older team now and there were games last year when it seemed as if the kansas city royals minnesota twins and even the boston red sox made them look lethargic but the yankees always seem to have a sense of where they are and what they need to do having struggled through parts of the 1999 season the yankees blistered their postseason opponents winning 11 out of 12 games leaving the atlanta braves in awe after their four game sweep of the world series joe torre their manager has said that pitching is the foundation of the yankees and from the no 1 starter orlando hernandez who will pitch the season opener to middle relief the yankees still have the most experience the most talent the most depth of any american league staff with cone roger clemens andy pettitte and others all backed by mariano rivera the best closer in the game chuck knoblauch jeter and o'neill the first three hitters in the lineup all played well in the spring and jorge posada who is in his first year as a full time front line catcher performed exceptionally in the last two weeks ricky ledee led the club with seven homers there are question marks too about how well first baseman tino martinez will perform in what could be his last season with the team and whether shane spencer will hit enough to hold the job as designated hitter but the yankees will once again be favored to win the world series and they will be compared with that oakland team all summer and perhaps into the fall those oakland athletics of the early 1970 's became the first team o'neill rooted for the first team that really drew him to baseball he loved their garish green and gold uniforms their mustaches owner charlie finley gave bonuses to any player who grew one and all the great players with all their great names cone too spoke of the lure of those monikers oakland had vida blue blue moon odom catfish hunter and reggie and rollie and bert campaneris and sal bando they had it all pitching defense power speed said goose gossage who pitched against the athletics while playing for the chicago white sox they were a team of great competitors that knew how to play the game that 's one of the best teams up against any team ever hunter ken holtzman and blue the team 's top three starting pitchers combined to win 171 games over those three seasons in 1973 each won 20 or more games in 1974 when oakland defeated los angeles in the world series for its third consecutive title hunter and holtzman were 28 years old blue was 24 the ace reliever rollie fingers eventually inducted into the hall of fame was 27 reggie jackson a special assistant with the yankees now was oakland 's right fielder and the american league 's most valuable player in 1973 we had better pitching than the current yankees jackson said it was like we had cone and clemens in their prime we had a great defensive ball club because we were together so long everyone knew each other so well guys knew where the second baseman was going to be on a cut off play we were good and efficient a lot of talent and efficient the oakland club was a better offensive club than this yankees team but the players union was gaining strength in its fight with owners and piece by piece the a 's crumbled hunter left after the 1974 season after winning an arbitrator 's decision jackson was traded before the 1976 season and free agency began in the fall of 1976 the a 's finished in last place in 1977 nobody would 've beaten us if they did n't break our club up jackson said they broke our club up and that 's the only reason why we did n't keep winning the a 's were very different from the current yankees in their clubhouse interaction they fought with each other and with finley who fought with his managers dick williams led oakland to titles in 1972 and 1973 and was replaced by alvin dark for the 1974 season these yankees are unusually harmonious quiet understated but intense we did n't play any harder than this team jackson said this team here you do n't play any harder than that they play very efficient baseball very professional team they get the home run when they have to they get the bunt down when they need to they get the save when they need to they get the good play when they need to the leadership has a lot to do with it i really think torre has a lot to do with it i think george steinbrenner has a lot to do with it i think there 's a quiet leadership about the field general that has a very very positive impact that keeps the players all pulling in a positive direction o'neill smiled when told of jackson 's feelings for that team and he understood in 25 years o'neill will feel as strongly about these yankees he 'll have the same pride o'neill and others acknowledge the yankees feel less external pressure than last year when they constantly faced questions about whether they could equal their 125 victory performance for the regular season and postseason of 1998 but through the summer the yankees desire to refine their own legacy particularly among the veterans like o'neill cone clemens knoblauch and bernie williams will build as it did in the second half of 1998 knoblauch said we 've put ourselves in position to really place our stamp on history
