 what 's your favorite baseball team dad you know i grew up in new york city rooting for the yankees what 's your second favorite team second favorite i 'd have to say it was this team they 're playing today the oakland a 's oakland why oakland well first of all when i was a kid the a 's were in kansas city where they 'd moved from philadelphia they were n't very good but they were like cousins to the yankees whenever the yankees needed a good player to help them win the pennant they 'd call up kansas city and presto just like a pizza the player was delivered like who like roger maris who hit 61 home runs in 1961 breaking babe ruth 's record why 'd the a 's just give the yankees a guy who could hit 61 home runs it was about money the a 's were one of the poorer teams and the yankees just like now could afford to pay more good players did the a 's stop giving the yankees players when they went to oakland actually for a while they did the oakland a 's in the early 1970 's were in fact a great team the best of that decade they won three straight world series and five straight american league west titles they had an owner named charles o finley who was a little nutty but was always willing to try new things like orange baseballs they had an amazing cast of colorful players who wore cool mustaches they had pitchers named catfish hunter and vida blue blue moon odom and rollie fingers they also had reggie jackson one of the best all time sluggers and bigmouths plus in 1973 they did all of us yankee fans a huge favor by beating the mets in the world series what happened after that the yankees wound up taking catfish and eventually getting reggie then they won the world series so even in oakland the a 's were like the yankees cousins and they were lousy again for a few years people stopped going to their games one season a student run college radio station had to broadcast the games for a while but as the a 's general manager billy beane told me the other day 'the a 's selling off players goes all the way back to connie mack in philadelphia but they have always been one of the most innovative franchises in baseball by the early 1980 's their farm system had produced three really good outfielders rickey henderson dwayne murphy and tony armas they played the aggressive style billyball of their manager billy martin who had also been with the yankees the a 's made the playoffs but lost to the yankees and then do n't tell me the yankees took their best player you got it henderson eventually joined the yankees and the manager martin rejoined them but even well into the era when players were leaving for the rich teams as well as being traded to them the a 's managed to build another excellent team they had the bash brothers jose canseco and mark mcgwire that mark mcgwire the very one he was on the a 's team that won three straight al pennants and won the 1989 world series a subway series like ours last year the a 's won four straight games over san francisco which is a bigger richer more glamorous city across the bay the a 's beating the giants in the world series is like the nets beating the knicks in the nba finals you were a sports columnist by then did you ever cover the bash brothers as a matter of fact i covered the first two games of that bay area series in oakland then before game 3 in san francisco a huge earthquake struck people died i was quite lucky that evening i might have been on a double decker freeway that collapsed had a friend not called to pick me up just as i was about to leave my hotel in oakland to drive over to his house in berkeley then what happened the series was delayed for more than a week i stayed to write about the earthquake the a 's best pitcher dave stewart who was from oakland gave me a tour of the poor and heavily damaged neighborhood he 'd grown up in after that i always rooted for stewart and did n't mind seeing the a 's do well because they always seemed to be struggling for fans in a city that fell on hard times and with owners who were losing money the poor a 's even had to trade mcgwire to st louis just before he hit 70 home runs so they traded maris who broke ruth 's record and mcgwire who broke maris 's with all that and everything else the a 's with 14 world series appearances are the second most successful al franchise behind the yankees will they ever keep their players as beane the general manager said 'part of the job description in oakland is the unknown but here the glass is always half full the a 's have this guy jason giambi who 's a great power hitter and some excellent young pitchers they almost beat the yankees in the playoffs last season and could very well beat them this time in october then what giambi will be a free agent after the season what do you think
