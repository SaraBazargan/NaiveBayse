 the look a mixture of maddening disbelief personal agony and resignation now seems fixed to giants coach jim fassel 's face it will linger on long after this disastrous season and fassel 's reign as coach has ended the lasting image of so much promise that evaporated so painfully it took precisely five plays into the giants 45 7 loss to the saints in the superdome on sunday night for that look to overtake fassel it took only that long for the saints to throw a 50 yard touchdown pass to become the latest stumbling team to cure its many ailments against the giants new orleans 7 7 took its place on that list whose latest entrants are the falcons the buccaneers the bills and the redskins to send the giants to the latest ugliest collapse of their 4 10 season perhaps the worst indignity occurred after a saints touchdown in the second quarter when receiver joe horn retrieved a cellphone that was hidden under the padding around the upright and appeared to make a call the giants came here trying and eventually failing to avoid their sixth straight loss they have not scored more than one offensive touchdown in any game since beating the jets on nov 2 and the downward spiral only picked up steam sunday in jesse palmer 's first start at quarterback in place of the injured starter kerry collins and at the hands of a giants defense worn to the nub by injuries and ineffectiveness saints fans sung along to the christmas tunes that filled the superdome during timeouts they quickly forgot that many of them entered the game openly discussing whether quarterback aaron brooks should be stashed on the bench brooks helped their amnesia by hitting horn with that 50 yard touchdown less than two minutes into the game before it was over brooks would throw five touchdown passes four to horn who certainly made an impression with his audacious cellphone celebration the officials reacted by giving him an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and saints coach jim haslett upbraided him on the sideline it was a rare embarrassing moment in a night full of triumphs for the saints who improved to 7 7 and breathed life into their dim playoff hopes for the giants bad turned to worse very quickly starting with poor coverage on the opening kickoff and that 50 yard touchdown the play to horn which came against one on one coverage by cornerback ralph brown also cost the giants the services of brown who reinjured his separated right shoulder while trying to knock the ball out of horn 's hands in the end zone with brown out the giants used kato serwanga and ike charlton at cornerback serwanga is primarily a special teams player and charlton was an emergency signing in midseason john carney kicked a 35 yard field goal to put the saints up 10 0 in the first quarter and the giants offense could do nothing it took until 3 minutes 40 seconds remained in the first for them to record a first down a quarter in which they gained 18 yards to the saints 111 with 24 seconds left in the quarter the giants got a spark when brooks fumbled a snap and giants linebacker dhani jones recovered at the saints 39 it was brooks 's 14th fumble of the season and the ninth lost fumble a major factor in the fans discontent with their team 's starting quarterback the giants used the momentum palmer scrambled for 26 yards to the 12 he capped the drive with a 4 yard touchdown pass to tight end visanthe shiancoe to make the score 10 7 with 13 05 left in the second quarter giving the giants a rare flicker of hope it was the first touchdown pass of palmer 's 4 year career and the first touchdown catch for shiancoe a rookie it was only shiancoe 's third pro catch and it was the giants last piece of good news they reverted to form after the touchdown getting flagged for a personal foul on the kickoff then yielding a 13 play 69 yard drive that ate up 7 14 and gave the saints a 17 7 lead on a 13 yard touchdown pass from brooks to horn horn 's choice of celebration taking a cellphone stashed under some padding in back of the end zone and appearing to make a call gave the giants good field position on their next drive because of the resulting unsportsmanlike conduct penalty they then used a trick play to gain 39 yards a double reverse from receiver david tyree to amani toomer who tossed the ball back to palmer who then threw it downfield to an open tyree who caught it at the 13 but disaster struck the giants again a personal foul call on shiancoe pushed them back and matt bryant 's 43 yard field goal attempt was blocked by kenny smith picked up by cornerback fred thomas and returned 62 yards for a touchdown with 3 10 left in the half giving the saints a 24 7 lead the espn cameras desperate for anything compelling to capture showed fassel in full agony after that play the giants offensive line had collapsed to allow the block the saints added two more touchdowns in the third quarter touchdown throws by brooks of 7 yards to horn and 26 to jerome pathon one play after the giants brian mitchell fumbled a kickoff brooks threw his fifth touchdown five seconds into the fourth quarter an 18 yarder to horn that made the score 45 7 before he gave way to todd bouman the switch fans had been calling for in anger before the game by then all the anger in the building could be corralled on the giants sideline amid a team unable to stop its free fall most of the emotion was etched on fassel 's face it is the image that will not go away extra points the giants trip to new orleans turned into an adventure on saturday because the new orleans airport was fogged in for several hours after a series of thunderstorms the giants plane was diverted to mobile ala where their pilot informed them he had passed the time limit the faa places on pilots shifts so after sitting for two hours on the runway in the plane the team boarded four buses and made the two hour drive
