 philip f berrigan the former roman catholic priest who led the draft board raids that galvanized opposition to the vietnam war in the late 1960 's died last night in baltimore after a lifetime of battling the american empire as he called it over the morality of its military and social policies he was 79 his family said the cause was liver and kidney cancer the associated press reported an army combat veteran sickened by the killing in world war ii mr berrigan came to be one of the most radical pacifists of the 20th century and for a time in the vietnam period a larger than life figure in the convulsive struggle over the country 's direction in the late 60 's he was a catholic priest serving a poor black parish in baltimore and seeing nothing that would change his conviction that war racism and poverty were inseparable strands of a corrupt economic system his josephite superiors had previously hustled him out of newburgh ny for aggressive civil rights and antiwar activity there the fatal blow he said had been a talk to a community affairs council in which he asked is it possible for us to be vicious brutal immoral and violent at home and be fair judicious beneficent and idealistic abroad he hardly missed a beat after his transfer to baltimore founding an antiwar group peace mission whose operations included picketing the homes of defense secretary robert s mcnamara and secretary of state dean rusk in december 1966 by the fall of 1967 mr berrigan and three friends were ready to try a new tactic on oct 17 they walked into the baltimore customs house distracted the draft board clerks and methodically spattered selective service records with a red liquid made partly from their own blood three decades later mr berrigan remembered feeling exalted as the judge sentenced him to six years in prison from then on he would be in and out of jail for repeated efforts to interfere with government operations and deface military hardware even before his sentencing for the customs house raid father berrigan instigated a second invasion against the local draft board office in catonsville md among those persuaded to join was his older brother the rev daniel j berrigan a jesuit priest and poet who had been one of the first prominent clergymen to preach and organize against the war the catonsville nine struck on may 17 1968 taking hundreds of files relating to potential draftees from the second floor of the knights of columbus building where the draft board rented space they piled the documents in the parking lot and set them burning with a mixture of gasoline and soap chips homemade napalm reporters were on hand having been told in advance and they were given a statement that read we destroy these draft records not only because they exploit our young men but also because they represent misplaced power concentrated in the ruling class of america when the police arrived the trespassers were praying in the parking lot the cameras loved the berrigans in the definitive photograph of the event seven of the catonsville nine are nowhere to be seen the photo includes only the striking image of two priests in clerical dress one big and craggy the other slight and puckish serenely accepting their imminent incarceration with so many marches and campus protests going on across the country it would have been impossible to quantify the effect of a single event on public opinion what can be said about the catonsville raid is that it inspired others in new york city milwaukee boston chicago and other cities the tactic becoming a sort of calling card of the ultra resistance it also elevated the berrigan brothers to the status of superstars father phil and father dan were on the cover of time magazine and illuminated in profiles by the smartest writers but many americans saw them as communists and traitors or at best naive dupes of the vietcong philip francis berrigan was born oct 5 1923 in two harbors minn the youngest of six sons of thomas w berrigan and frida fromhart berrigan a german immigrant thomas berrigan was a frustrated poet and a bullying tyrannical husband and father he was also a political radical whose labor organizing activities led to his dismissal as a railroad engineer after which he moved to syracuse to be with his family and bought a farm after high school philip was a first baseman in semiprofessional baseball before enrolling in st michael 's college in toronto in january 1943 after one semester he was drafted into the army the life of black sharecroppers in georgia where he had basic training and the treatment of black soldiers on his troop ship to europe made an indelible impression on his conscience in retrospect once the war was over so did his own role in infantry and artillery battles that earned him a battlefield commission as second lieutenant in so many words he came to consider himself as guilty of murder as the germans and japanese along with this came the conviction that he had grown up on a diet of nationalistic propaganda in which the good white europeans always triumphed over evil anyone else as an assistant pastor in washington in 1955 and 1956 and a counselor and teacher at st augustine high school in new orleans from 1956 to 1963 the young priest became passionately involved in civil rights and antiwar activities especially after the cuban missile crisis in 1962
