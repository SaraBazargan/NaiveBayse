 knicks coach jeff van gundy spent the all star game break wearing his thinking cap pondering ways to get latrell sprewell allan houston and glen rice more court time together but after four days of analysis van gundy came up with nothing more than a greater appreciation for the problem created by the three man logjam van gundy said that starting the big backcourt of sprewell and houston was out of the question because it weakened the knicks on defense where they are the strongest and while rice has played well in spurts at power forward van gundy believes it is unrealistic to expect the 6 foot 8 rice to play an extended amount of time at that position in every game i thought a lot about it van gundy said after practice today an hour or so before the knicks flew to denver for tuesday 's game against the nuggets 27 24 it 's the same age old problem it 's just a tough situation for glen to be in i think he 's handled himself extremely well rice 's role was the most controversial issue facing the knicks 29 18 over their first 47 games and it looks as if it could be a problem for the rest of the season while the possibility exists a trade before the feb 22 deadline is unlikely because of rice 's age 33 contract four years 36 million and current bout with a strained arch in his left foot moreover the knicks who have been shopping rice for much of the season are beginning to value his contributions in fact his solid play of late particularly in light of his injury is beginning to create the feeling in the locker room and on the coaching staff that the more rice plays the better the knicks are in the 17 games in which rice who is averaging a career low 297 minutes has played at least 32 minutes the knicks are 11 6 if we 're going to be successful glen has to play well and play a lot sprewell said you guys have seen a couple of games where he 's really shot the ball well and kind of won some games for us just had everybody on his back if my playing point guard is what we have to do to help get him more minutes more time on the floor and more shots then that 's what needs to be done sprewell houston and rice started 16 games together while charlie ward was sidelined after right knee surgery on nov 27 the knicks were 10 6 in those games but while the statistics suggest otherwise van gundy insists that their defense was poor it is true that sprewell had a hard time keeping opposing point guards from breaking down the knicks defense by penetrating the lane over all the knicks held their opponents to 412 percent shooting which is lower than their season average of 418 percent rice would love to give the big backcourt another try like we 've said from day 1 with us three it can definitely work rice said referring to houston sprewell and himself you have three of the best players in the league at any given time either one of us can break you down shoot over you post you up and that 's a big advantage for our team but whether i get more minutes or not i 'm going to go out there and try and do what i can to give support for the team and do whatever i can to get a win rice whose solid defense has been one of the season 's biggest surprises has also proven to be a better rebounder than advertised against smaller teams like milwaukee rice can be effective at power forward but on most nights van gundy does not feel comfortable playing him there not surprisingly rice who averages 43 rebounds thinks he is up to the task i 'm beginning to like that power forward spot rice said with a smile i feel like i 'm one of the bigger guys now i 've always been a good rebounder and i think one of the things i 'm able to do is get to the ball a little bit quicker than the bigger power forwards and on the offensive end i think it 's a big advantage for us as well still if sprewell houston and rice are to play a great deal together it will be in the big backcourt alignment especially come playoff time while van gundy likes having a traditional point guard in the game he has been going to the big backcourt more often last week he played that unit for the last 12 minutes of the knicks double overtime victory over dallas and for the final 17 minutes of a loss to houston when asked if over the weekend he seriously considered returning to sprewell and houston as the starting guards van gundy said no no no but certainly the last two games have proven that i think we can finish with it and i do n't know down the road what 's going to happen rebounds the knicks start the second half of the season five and a half games behind atlantic division leading philadelphia 36 14 they have a great opportunity to make up some ground because the 76ers all star center theo ratliff will have his fractured right wrist in a cast for the next two weeks ratliff the league 's leading shot blocker will then be re evaluated and will either have his wrist placed in another cast for two to four weeks or undergo surgery while philadelphia 's misfortune could work in the knicks favor the knicks schedule is about to get tougher after playing at denver on tuesday the knicks visit utah on wednesday also after having four separate breaks of three days off between games in january the knicks get no more than one day off between their 19 games over the next five weeks
