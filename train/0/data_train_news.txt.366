 kelly wunsch said that the chicago white sox never planned to challenge major league baseball 's steroid testing rules but they did so last march as players circulated a drug test acceptance form wunsch said a few wondered what would happen if they refused to be tested what would happen the white sox players learned is that they could seriously influence the future of testing when 16 of the 37 players on the roster did not want to be tested initially they found out that a refusal would count as a positive and would increase the chances that major leaguers would surpass the 5 percent threshold to activate stricter testing in 2004 some had the foresight to realize they could have an impact on forcing mandatory tests by declining to be tested this year after wunsch the white sox player representative discussed this with the union gene orza the union 's associate general counsel told him that each refusal would be reviewed and that almost no reasons for bypassing the test would be permitted the holdouts some of whom sandy alomar jr said were pushed into their decisions by veteran players nonetheless sent a message about their desire for testing to ensure that everyone would be on an even playing field in the future wunsch said the 16 players eventually gave their urine samples it was never meant to be a political statement or something to get media attention wunsch said last week in a telephone interview if somebody respects us for doing that that 's fine i do n't think that we deserve any more respect than anybody who does n't want cheating in the game wunsch a 6 foot 5 reliever who packs all of 225 pounds onto his gangly frame said he hoped that steroid use would be reduced because of the stiff penalties taking effect next year after 5 percent to 7 percent of the 1198 tests came back positive starting next year a player who tests positive twice will be identified and may be suspended 15 games or fined 10000 or both suspensions and fines escalate with each ensuing positive test nobody is happy to see there are 5 percent of the players doing steroids wunsch said but i 'm happy there 's going to be punitive testing so we can get that number lower a lot of guys you talk with hope this leads to steroids being out of the game wunsch thinks the anonymous testing was effective because he said he saw a number of physiques early on this year that did n't look quite the same wunsch figures more physiques will shrink he said because the thought of having your name attached to steroids is unnerving while wunsch said being identified as a steroid user would be a powerful deterrent he called the potential suspensions and fines fairly soft handed and suggested that players be fined a percentage of their salaries that could make a positive test both embarrassing and more costly regardless of how it happened the players tripped it wunsch said i 'm happy that it 's going to be instituted not only does it get guys off steroids it eliminates the temptation for guys who thought about using them defection pre empted kendry morales is considered the next great cuban phenomenon a power hitter who can play first base third base and the outfield so why did the cubans send the 20 year old morales home from the olympic qualifying tournament in panama two weeks ago the team said morales left for personal reasons but carlos rodriguez president of the cuban national baseball commission said later on state television that an unidentified player had been approached by scouts and offered the opportunity to defect and sign with the yankees or another team kendry morales is their prize roberto gonzalez echevarria a professor at yale university who has written extensively about cuban baseball said by telephone last week he was sent back because they were afraid he was going to defect gordon blakeley the yankees senior vice president for baseball operations said that carlos rios had been scouting in panama but that rios did not get involved in helping players defect the yankees become interested blakeley said once the players are out of cuba we obviously like cuban players blakeley said in a telephone interview we want them to come over here and be free agents because we have the money to sign them i would doubt any of our people would say that to a player since two players pitcher maels rodriguez and second baseman yobal duenas defected last month the cubans have been wary about a player of morales 's caliber javier mendez a renowned cuban player told the kansas city star that morales can become cuba 's greatest ballplayer all time gonzalez echevarria said that morales who plays for industriales could be punished if the cubans felt he was receptive to the scout and that he would be closely monitored i 'm sure he 's seen the things that have happened with other players in cuba and said 'the heck with it gonzalez echevarria said he 's got to get out of cuba music men while the yankees and the red sox were competing for first place last season bernie williams heard that boston 's tim wakefield also an accomplished guitarist wanted a copy of his compact disc the journey within so rivalry be damned williams sent it to him and rivalry be damned again wakefield played it around his teammates he 's a brilliant musician wakefield said during the playoffs it 's something to aspire to loren harriet the cd 's producer said it had been ranked third to seventh on billboard 's contemporary jazz chart for 18 consecutive weeks next month williams could receive more exciting news his record label submitted his cd to be nominated for a grammy award it 's a real real long shot harriet said but you never know 'a young pedro how high will the montreal expos price for javier vazquez be in a trade in general manager omar minaya 's mind it is the cost of a pedro martinez clone he 's a young pedro minaya said last week in phoenix look at his numbers and pedro 's numbers before the expos traded him martinez was 65 39 with a 300 earned run average in his first six seasons vazquez is 64 68 with a 416 era in the same period close but not identical clearly though minaya is using this comparison in trade discussions including how martinez proceeded to go 101 28 with a 226 era in six seasons with boston all for charity among the items auctioned at keith hernandez 's charity dinner last wednesday was a basketball autographed by kobe bryant and a guitar autographed by michael jackson the ball went for 400 and the guitar sold for 700
