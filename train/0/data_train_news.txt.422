 neuroscientists have found an evocative solution to a classic problem which is more important in shaping the human brain nature or nurture their answer is complex the brain is not primarily the product of genes they say but neither is it simply the sum of one 's experiences rather they say each human brain is constructed of complex neural circuits that start taking shape before birth and continue to grow and change throughout life as genes and cells are influenced by environment experience and culture there is widespread agreement that genes and environment interact in brain development said dr terrence j sejnowski a neuroscientist at the salk institute in san diego and a leading proponent of the new synthesis the new idea he said is that human cultures which teach children what to believe and what to expect in life interact with cell biology and molecular genetics to assemble the highly social human brain though everyone 's brain begins with a basic scaffold of connectivity that is formed according to genetic blueprints said dr carla shatz a developmental neurobiologist at harvard medical school a baby 's brain is not a miniature of the adult 's but rather is a dynamically changing structure experience alters brain structure chemistry and gene expression to sculpture immature neural circuits into adult circuitry she said in short the theory 's advocates say while the brain directs people 's activities in everyday life the activities themselves shape the brain throughout life the attempt to separate genes and environment is a mistake said dr steven r quartz a scientist at the california institute of technology what makes us who we are is a complex interplay of early experiences parenting birth order friends genes and how these forces interact he and dr sejnowski wrote liars lovers and heroes published last month which outlines details of what they call cultural biology another book making similar arguments the origin of minds is to be published this month its authors are dr peggy la cerra a neuroscientist and president of a consulting firm in ojai calif and roger bingham of the center for brain and cognition at the university of california at san diego scientists and philosophers have argued about the role of culture in shaping the brain for millenniums plato and artistotle argued over whether human traits like virtue were inborn or learned darwin 's ideas led many scholars to declare that human traits were inborn with each racial group at a different level of evolution a view that culminated in the unbridled eugenics of the holocaust the backlash was an era of cultural relativism which saw the newborn brain as a blank slate that evolution had no part in a new battle over human nature began in the 1970 's when dr edward o wilson argued that human behavior like that of other animals was a product of the evolutionary pressures of natural selection evolutionary psychologists adopted this argument using it to explain everything from sexual differences in dating behavior to the appeal of potato chips the advocates of the new neurobiological view say it is time to look more closely at the evidence for evolutionary psychology 's position it 's true you ca n't separate the question of who we are from the world our ancestors passed through on their way to becoming us dr sejnowski said but that evolution did not occur in the relatively stable savanna described by evolutionary psychologists he said but rather during a period of unusual extreme and rapid oscillations in climate if the brain evolved any trait during the pleistocene he declared it was flexibility while it is true that different brain regions tend to specialize in different functions like language or face recognition dr sejnowski said these areas are very changeable and not hard wired modules humans are born with temperaments arising from genetic variations in brain chemicals called neuromodulators dr quartz said these differences may lead one baby to avoid novelty and another to seek it but the experiences that result help construct the growing brain humans are also born with a very large prefrontal cortex a higher brain region involved in planning that taps into an ancient system for predicting what is rewarding and making decisions to maximize rewards and avoid punishments neuroscientists are finding that this circuit which fully matures in late adolescence is an internal guidance system that fills each person 's world with values meaning and emotional tone taking shape according to a person 's culture in other words culture contributes not just to the brain 's contents but to its wiring as well dr quartz said
