 in his four seasons with the giants running back sean bennett has had three uniform numbers and an equal number of serious knee injuries and that is not counting a hamstring strain that took a year to heal he has been on the physically unable to perform list and on injured reserve he has been cut by the giants and virtually ignored by the rest of the national football league once a training camp phenomenon who became a rookie starter in the giants opening game in 1999 bennett did not play a down in the next two seasons without an nfl team a year ago the 26 year old bennett spent the season working out alone he dabbled in drawing he was an art major at northwestern and chauffeured his wife shelley a part time actress to auditions in new york city on sundays he had pizza delivered to their new jersey apartment a few miles from giants stadium and watched the giants on television although the giants cut him sept 2 2001 the team offered to provide him with game tickets but as bennett said today i would have had to pay for them the pizza was cheaper not surprisingly sunday afternoons were the hardest times last year for bennett a fourth round draft pick once considered a future star but now bennett is back in a giants uniform wearing no 20 after wearing no 44 as a rookie and no 28 in his second and third preseasons he has not missed a practice and with tiki barber the starting running back injured he has even been a workhorse in the backfield in saturday 's preseason victory over the new england patriots the giants dedicated almost an entire drive to bennett in the third quarter bennett touched the ball on 9 of 10 plays as the giants moved from their 18 yard line to the patriots 23 he rushed 6 times for 22 yards and caught 3 passes for 33 yards bennett ended the drive with a fumble on the 10th play but for a player who endured a 31 month football layoff it was a coming out party moreover bennett came out of the game healthy he finished with 32 rushing yards on 8 carries and a team high 6 receptions for 56 yards well aware of bennett 's history of injuries the giants have been low key about his potential role in the offense this season after all barber is the star of the backfield and more passes than ever will be going to the tight end the rookie jeremy shockey but after a few weeks of training camp practices and two preseason games it is also apparent that bennett is prominent in the giants plans he is on first string special teams and could be paired with barber for a quick dangerous backfield at 6 feet 1 inch and 230 pounds and blessed with great speed and soft hands bennett has always dazzled the giants coaches with his potential it is what made the offensive coordinator sean payton design whole sections of the team playbook with bennett in mind heading into the 2000 season that was before the injuries mounted he missed all of that season with a knee injury and came into the preseason last year with a hamstring injury that seemingly would not heal the giants finally threw up their hands and cut bennett when he was released bennett went back to his new jersey apartment and stayed busy while waiting for his injury to heal raised in evansville ind bennett decided it was time to learn about new york city he made trips into manhattan three or four times a week driving his wife to auditions and seeing as many broadway plays as he could i could probably drive a cab in there now bennett said bennett also stayed in touch with the giants he did drawings for the families of two giants coaches the defensive coordinator johnnie lynn and the linebackers coach tom olivadotti i would draw their wives and children bennett said i 've done that before in college that 's how i paid for my wife 's engagement ring when bennett 's legs felt strong enough to resume running he made one major change in his off season training regimen he cut it in half last year the giants were aghast to find out that bennett after doing his usual two hour workout at giants stadium frequently drove directly to a local high school and worked out for another two or three hours he was wearing himself out giants coach jim fassel said maybe cutting him back will not be the answer to better health but man it ca n't hurt for now bennett has been something he has never been in a giants training camp largely unnoticed and healthy with another new number these days at practice he could be any unheralded free agent after my rookie year when i hurt my knee twice i switched from no 44 because i thought it brought me bad luck bennett said but then no 28 was even worse so far i feel pretty good with no 20 i 'm thinking it might be a keeper extra points darnell dinkins the fourth string quarterback who became an overnight star with a thunderous hit covering a giants punt in saturday night 's preseason game began working out monday with the tight ends giants coach jim fassel said he wanted to try to find a spot on the team for dinkins especially to keep him available for special teams center dusty zeigler whose recovery from off season knee surgery has been enveloped by uncertainty was in colorado on monday for a second opinion from a knee specialist the giants have set no target date for when zeigler might be available to play fassel indicated that the rookie receiver tim carter who bruised his back in practice aug 1 would probably not practice this week that means he will not play in the next preseason game saturday in atlanta running back tiki barber participated in about 15 practice plays monday the most since he strained a rib cage muscle last week
