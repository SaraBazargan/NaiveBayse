 the big east rebounding from the defection of three of its members to the atlantic coast conference ranged to the midwest and to the south to reconfigure itself yesterday by welcoming louisville cincinnati and south florida in all sports and depaul and marquette in every sport but football the realignment makes the big east which formed in 1979 to take advantage of the multitude of basketball talent and passion in the metropolitan areas of the northeast perhaps the nation 's top basketball conference but it has severely weakened the league 's position in big time and big money college football we 're a conference loaded in basketball and now we 're solid in football but we need to get better mike tranghese the commissioner of the big east said at a news conference in manhattan the changes were made out of necessity after virginia tech and miami ranked no 5 and no 6 in the associated press football poll decided to join the acc last summer they will begin play there in the 2004 5 season three weeks ago they were followed by boston college which will begin acc play in 2005 6 by adding louisville cincinnati and south florida current members of conference usa for 2005 6 the big east meets the eight team requirement for a league to be included in the bowl championship series which determines who plays in the sugar rose orange and fiesta bowls berths worth a combined 115 million although the big east will remain in the bcs the next two years its membership could be re evaluated when the current contract runs out after the 2005 season and the impact on the league will be felt immediately in the coming months the big east must renegotiate its television deals with abc and espn as part of a reconfiguration clause in the contracts the networks are likely to offer much less for football especially because the league will consist of rutgers pittsburgh syracuse temple west virginia connecticut and boston college a lame duck next season temple will be dropped from the conference for the 2005 6 season the big east has separate contracts for football and basketball tranghese said but he declined to say for how much an athletic official at a big east member college says the league commands 15 million annually for football and basketball louisville 7 1 is enjoying a fine football season and has played in 10 bowl games but the teams at louisville and cincinnati have all time records below 500 and connecticut is in only its fourth year in division i a south florida was founded in 1956 began playing football in 1997 and has yet to be invited to a bowl game although it has posted a 49 25 record the big east athletic directors and college leaders who gathered yesterday played down their perilous footing in the bcs and pointed to the often glorious tradition of football at colleges like pittsburgh and syracuse they also noted the hold the conference now has on coveted major media markets the new configuration will be able to reach nearly 24 million households with television or 22 percent of the nation according to the conference it 's a market driven entity pittsburgh 's athletic director jeff long said of the bcs if you look at the conference as a whole we 're the sixth strongest and outdistance the seventh  or eighth best conferences by a long way the new additions are a boon for the big east 's now 16 member basketball conference marquette reached the final four last season cincinnati is a perennial title contender under coach bob huggins and louisville already has two national titles 1980 and 1986 and a successful charismatic coach in rick pitino who led kentucky to the 1996 national title and three other teams to the final four including providence of the big east this association will provide us the national stage that we all desire louisville 's vice president and director of athletics tom jurich said yesterday at a news conference on the louisville campus this athletic department has worked long and hard over the last six years to put ourselves in the position to be attractive to a conference as prestigious as the big east depaul with a rich tradition in the sport will also help make the big east a formidable basketball league it already includes the defending national champion syracuse the consensus preseason no 1 connecticut st john 's notre dame georgetown seton hall villanova pittsburgh providence rutgers and west virginia the teams we lost at least from a basketball perspective were not going to be a great loss for the league villanova 's president edmund dobbin said on balance we 're better off with this whether the new colleges will preserve the big east 's status in football may depend on whether the bcs survives in its current form either way the bcs established six years ago as a way to determine the best two football teams in the nation and match them in a title game has reshaped the college landscape and opened an often vitriolic dialogue about the role of intercollegiate athletics in higher education conference usa has moved quickly to address its losses adding rice southern methodist and tulsa from the western athletic conference and central florida and marshall from the mid american conference college leaders from non bcs conferences have pressed their case to lawmakers in washington that the system is exclusionary and have threatened antitrust litigation and presidents from each side of the debate continue to negotiate either a compromise or a new structure entirely that will give more conferences greater access to the money from the big bowl games who knows what the next generation of the bcs is going to be notre dame 's athletic director kevin white said right now it is like painting by numbers in the dark
