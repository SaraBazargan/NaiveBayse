 one of the greatest challenges for nasa managers when space shuttles start flying again will be finding better ways to anticipate problems that can compromise safety the leader of the space agency said today sean o'keefe the national aeronautics and space administration administrator said a theme emerging in the investigation of the columbia disaster was how well the agency identifies potential problems testimony by experts before the independent board investigating the feb 1 loss of the columbia and its seven member crew has repeatedly brought up nasa 's capacity to do trend analysis mr o'keefe said at a news briefing such analysis of abnormal events large and small can help identify things that could be safety problems in the future when we identify problems there is no question people get all over it to fix it mr o'keefe said but the agency 's record of spotting trends in operations that can point to potential problems that could be fixed early has been mixed he said mr o'keefe said the three remaining shuttles would fly again as soon as nasa adopted the recommendations of the columbia accident investigation board which are expected this summer the space agency is eager to resume launching shuttles as soon as possible so it can continue construction and maintenance of the international space station but in no case are we rushing to return to flight at the expense of safety mr o'keefe said when flights restart the first shuttle to go up will be commanded by col eileen m collins of the air force colonel collins had been assigned to lead a march shuttle mission to the space station that was to follow the columbia 's safe return but all shuttle flights were grounded after the accident the assignment to return the shuttle to flight status will be colonel collins 's fourth mission and her second as commander we could not have entrusted this to a more competent commander who is extremely well qualified to do it mr o'keefe said also assigned to the first resumed flight were other members of colonel collins 's crew from the earlier assignment lt col james m kelly of the air force dr stephen k robinson and soichi noguchi an astronaut with the japanese space agency the mission will probably be a resupply and crew exchange flight to the space station mr o'keefe said a hunt for columbia debris that has covered more than a half million acres in texas and louisiana is winding down and operations should end in about two weeks he said more than 70000 pieces of the columbia have been recovered representing almost 40 percent of the shuttle by weight he said
