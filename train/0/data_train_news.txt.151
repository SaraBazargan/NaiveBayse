 dick vermeil knows the enduring image he left behind when he last coached in the super bowl nearly two decades ago half wet blanket half drill sergeant vermeil wound his philadelphia eagles so tight in the week before super bowl xv in 1981 that they played panicky and tense in a game set in new orleans the loose and rambunctious oakland raiders who unlike vermeil 's eagles relished the carnival atmosphere and flouted the notion of curfew romped in a laugher that is at least the favored historical story line of the raiders 27 10 victory this evening arriving in atlanta for super bowl xxxiv as coach of the st louis rams vermeil neither disputed nor conceded past mistakes in the curious setting of pro football 's season ending game where entertainment meets military style preparations but in his first news conference he announced i do n't have any curfews scheduled just in case anyone has a vision of vermeil at midnight dashing around atlanta with a lamp shade on his head consider this vermeil 's coaching staff did not even accompany the team to atlanta for the beginning of the super bowl festivities the coaches are back in st louis preparing the rams game plan for sunday 's game with the tennessee titans that 's because vermeil 19 years removed from the week that has come to define the discipline driven excesses of his previous coaching tenure is still trying to figure out ways to make the super bowl more like a regular season game because his staff usually maps out the game plan on monday and tuesday each week in the rams suburban st louis offices the coaches are doing it again this week vermeil 's coaches will arrive here late tuesday night hours before they deliver the game plan on wednesday morning i felt like this was the best way to keep our normal routine vermeil said football coaches are famous creatures of habit and we feel very insecure outside of our usual routines so vermeil is willing to do some things differently the second time around though he 's only going so far i am much more relaxed this time and more mature a smiling and easygoing vermeil said moments after his team arrived at its atlanta hotel i remember being wound up in a lot of knots at this point in my last super bowl hopefully this is a little better approach vermeil would n't go so far as to admit that his nervousness made his 1980 81 eagles nervous and he even seemed to discount it at one point to think the raiders won that game because we were extremely disciplined and wanted to send a great image about what we were all about to america vermeil said i do n't think that 's right but vermeil also did not run from the characterization that he might have created an atmosphere that was too rigid i do n't know if my players could sense that i was wound up vermeil said whenever you lose a game like that whatever you did was wrong for the rest of your life it 's what you did wrong i 've learned to live with that that week i just told them that anybody who was going out and getting in trouble i was going to send them home it 's a business trip this is a business trip i do n't expect there to be any problems super bowl teams have had diverse philosophies about curfews including when in the week to begin them meanwhile the few rams who were available to reporters after their trip tonight to atlanta did not believe they needed reminders from vermeil about their nighttime conduct i do n't expect guys to lock themselves in their rooms linebacker london fletcher said guys will go out but they 'll be careful said running back marshall faulk i do n't see something like that as being any kind of issue in this game told that it was a primary topic 19 years ago faulk replied nineteen years is a long time ago extra points rams coach dick vermeil said he did not expect any players to miss sunday 's game because of injury that included place kicker jeff wilkins who has a sore knee and who missed a 44 yard field goal in the national football conference championship game the rams had considered signing kicker nick lowery last week but vermeil believed wilkins could kick through his injury and still thinks so his injury is no excuse for missing a field goal vermeil said if i thought so i 'd take a guy off the streets he said that right defensive end fred miller also had a sore knee but he did not expect it to affect miller 's play significantly vermeil 63 also declined to discuss whether he was considering retirement from coaching especially if his rams win
