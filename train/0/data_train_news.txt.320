 a small biotechnology company is expected to announce today that it has determined the three dimensional structure of a crucial enzyme in the virus that causes sars an accomplishment that could accelerate efforts to develop treatments for the deadly respiratory disease the company structural genomix of san diego said yesterday it had unraveled the shape of the sars protease an enzyme that plays an essential role in replication of the virus and is a prime target for scientists trying to disable it knowing that shape should make it easier to design drugs that mesh with the enzyme like a key in a lock and block it from working you can see what you 're doing said timothy j r harris chief executive of structural genomix which is privately held a similar technique was used to develop the protease inhibitors that have had a significant effect in treating hiv infection structural genomix has put the structure in the protein data bank a publicly accessible database allowing all researchers to study it but the company has also filed for a patent on the structure dr harris said he said that he did not intend to stop academic research but that companies wanting to use the structure to develop drugs might have to negotiate with structural genomix providing the patent is granted we hope that they will come to us and say 'you 've got the structure why do n't we work together he said how valuable the patent will be depends to some extent on whether sars which has killed more than 800 people and sickened more than 8000 becomes a serious recurring problem or continues to die out scientists have already developed computer approximations of what the sars enzyme would look like based on the equivalent enzymes in viruses somewhat similar to sars but dr harris said the actual structure differs from the models and would be better for drug discovery structural genomix specializes in rapidly determining the three dimensional structures of proteins by bouncing x rays off a crystal of the protein and inferring the shape from how the x rays scatter this process called x ray crystallography used to take months or years if it could be done at all but new technology has reduced the time needed to weeks dr harris said it took eight weeks to determine the protease structure but half that time was taken in obtaining the dna for the viral proteins from collaborators at the genome institute of singapore and getting it through customs an article in the july 18 science magazine quotes a scientist in beijing who claims to have determined the structure of the sars protease but structural genomix appears to be the first to make its structure public
