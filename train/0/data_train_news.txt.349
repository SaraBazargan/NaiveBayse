 the space shuttle columbia released a reinvigorated hubble space telescope today 365 miles above earth sending the orbiting observatory away with new eyes to continue its probings of the universe columbia sent hubble on its way after almost a week of being docked together as teams of astronauts conducted five spacewalks in five days to renovate and repair the 12 year old telescope lt col nancy j currie of the army the main operator of the shuttle 's robot arm plucked hubble from its work station on columbia and released it at 5 04 am eastern time while over the atlantic ocean cmdr scott d altman of the navy the mission commander aided by lt col duane g carey of the air force fired columbia 's thrusters to back the shuttle away from the telescope as the 24000 pound telescope drifted away dr john m grunsfeld the astrophysicist who guided its refurbishment in three spacewalks and who visited hubble in 1999 said farewell we bid hubble well on its new journey with its new tools to explore the universe dr grunsfeld said good luck mr hubble the service mission the fourth to hubble since its launching in 1990 leaves the 2 billion telescope with the capability to eclipse its already long list of accomplishments and to peer into corners of the universe previously hidden from human eyes the telescope was named for the astronomer edwin p hubble who died in 1953 while hubble was attached to a work bench in the shuttle 's cargo bay two teams of astronauts dr grunsfeld and dr richard m linnehan and james h newman and michael j massimino took turns climbing up and down the four story structure changing it inside and out the astronauts removed older equipment including the last of hubble 's original cameras a malfunctioning power control unit and its solar arrays they added a new main camera a new power shunting unit improved solar panels and a cooling unit intended to revive a disabled infrared camera the new equipment passed tests indicating that it had been properly installed and appeared to be in good order but project managers said it would be weeks before they could test hubble 's expanded capabilities nasa scientists estimated that it would be three to four weeks before they would take pictures with the new main camera the advanced camera for surveys and early may before they got images from the infrared device the near infrared camera and multi object spectrometer or nicmos on friday in the final spacewalk of the 11 day mission astronauts installed an experimental refrigeration device to cool the sensors of nicmos which has not operated for three years since losing its original coolant the camera needs sensors chilled to minus 334 degrees fahrenheit to detect the faint infrared heat of faraway objects when the outside work was done columbia fired its small steering jets for 36 minutes to raise the shuttle and hubble 's orbit by about four miles to compensate for a gradual decay in the telescope 's orbit columbia is scheduled to return to the kennedy space center in florida on tuesday
