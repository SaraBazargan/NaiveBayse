 the scene and the scenario were nothing new as penn students stormed the court the second the buzzer sounded embraced their heroes and rejoiced in the sound defeat of their archrival princeton the ivy league regular season always seems to end like this with penn beating princeton or princeton beating penn with everything on the line but there was an enticing twist this time this was the game that resolved nothing other than guaranteeing that this most interesting ivy league race will have a second and third course the only major college conference that does not have a postseason tournament will have one anyway penn saw to that tonight at the palestra with a 64 48 victory over princeton a princeton victory would have given the tigers the undisputed ivy league title instead princeton penn and yale finished the regular season in a three way tie at 11 3 each in league play the three teams will begin to sort things out thursday night when princeton 16 10 faces yale at the palestra the winner will play penn 24 6 on saturday at lafayette college in easton pa with a trip to the ncaa tournament on the line penn received a first round bye based on its superior record in head to head play among the three teams this was the first three way tie at the end of an ivy league regular season yale is a roadblock princeton 's ahmed el nokali said we 're going to get through them and get penn on saturday night el nokali was surprisingly confident but maybe wearing a princeton or penn uniform does that to you the two teams have combined to win the last 14 ivy titles and 31 of the last 33 still princeton is going to have to improve on tonight 's performance and then find a way to get past penn which has beaten the tigers by 40 points over two games this season for the first 17 minutes of the game princeton played miserably with more than 15 minutes gone in the half the tigers had just 6 points but were fortunate that penn was nearly as cold on the offensive end the quakers did not get their first basket until koko archibong hit a short jumper with 13 minutes 49 seconds remaining with 3 01 left in the half el nokali hit his first of three straight 3 point attempts that trimmed the penn lead to 24 19 at the half el nokali 's hot shooting streak included a 35 footer at the buzzer that promised to give princeton the momentum it had been lacking all night this was a very frustrating loss said princeton 's mike bechtold who was 0 for 6 from the floor we thought we were in good position at the half it was mostly a matter of our shots not falling then things just fell apart in the second half penn played like the champion it hopes to be in the second half the quakers hit 13 of 20 shots from the floor including 5 of 8 3 point attempts el nokali 's layup with 8 15 left in the game got princeton within 6 but penn responded with an 11 4 run princeton showed a little life when an el nokali jumper with 3 35 left cut the lead to 9 but penn 's jeff schiffner hit a 3 pointer on the next possession all but sealing it for the quakers andrew toole led penn with 19 points ugonna onyekwe added 16 to go with 8 rebounds and the quakers had a 36 24 rebounding advantage el nokali led princeton with 18 points princeton shot just 373 percent from the floor and was 5 for 22 on 3 point attempts many of them open shots kyle wente like bechtold usually a reliable offensive threat was also cold he was 1 for 9 from the floor everybody 's down and everybody 's real disappointed right now wente said we have n't played to our potential against them coach told us to just forget about it that may not be a bad idea this may have been princeton 's most important game of the season it wo n't be its most important game this week
