 with only nine days to go until the belmont stakes and with two races in the triple crown series complete it is no longer so much about proving who has the best horse but who can deliver a healthy and fit animal to the starting gate for the race on june 7 for that reason it was a good morning for the barclay tagg stable and funny cide yesterday and a dismal one for a horse thought to be one of his main competitors in his first workout since his dominant victory in the preakness funny cide acted like a horse who is holding up just fine continuing a pattern of fast and seemingly effortless workouts that has been part of his itinerary since before the kentucky derby funny cide a new york bred gelding breezed through a quick five furlong workout in 5943 seconds over a muddy main track at belmont park he 's got a big job ahead of him and i think we 're keeping him at his peak at his level tagg said he 's doing great i have no complaints with the way he 's doing about 750 miles to the southwest the trainer ron ellis may have been wishing he had reason to be as optimistic atswhatimtalknbout a fast charging fourth in the kentucky derby slogged through a one mile workout at churchill downs that was so slow that ellis is questioning the wisdom of running in the belmont atswhatimtalknbout a son of ap indy slogged his way through a one mile workout over a fast track in 1 4680 funny cide is known as a good workout horse so the quick time yesterday came as no surprise but it was nonetheless good news for a stable that believes the main obstacle to sweeping the triple crown may be keeping the horse at a high level something that is not always easy to do after two such grueling races as the kentucky derby and the preakness if he 's the same as he was going into the kentucky derby and the preakness nothing can beat him said robin smullen funny cide 's exercise rider and assistant trainer but everything has to continue to fall into place the fatigue factor is the thing you have to worry about it 's been a tough road he 's been on he appears to be the same horse but sometimes you wo n't know until the race itself everything can seem to be 100 percent and then they wo n't quite have what they had in other races but he appears to be just as good now as he was before the other two races tagg had postponed the workout because of the bad weather which had left the belmont main track a mess but he was satisfied with yesterday 's conditions to return to serious training the result was a workout that was the fastest among the 12 horses who worked at the distance it has not been a good couple of weeks for ellis who has been trying to work through foot problems with atswhatimtalknbout who has a quarter crack in his right front hoof atswhatimtalknbout had missed two days of training last week but appeared to be back on track yesterday 's workout could mean that the foot troubles are not behind him he went really slow ellis said i think he 's protecting that quarter crack he was traveling fine but he was n't enthusiastic we patched it up two days ago we 're going to take the patch off thursday and see how his foot looks we 'll make a decision on the belmont stakes after that you just do n't know how it 's going to look until you pull the patch off in addition to the slow time atswhatimtalknbout lost the shoe on his left front foot during the workout the possible field for the belmont has 13 horses those considered definite starters are funny cide empire maker dynever ten most wanted scrimshaw best minister colita and supervisor the possible starters are atswhatimtalknbout midway road go rockin robin outta here and wild and wicked
