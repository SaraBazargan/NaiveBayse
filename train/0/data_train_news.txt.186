 dr irving l lichtenstein who transformed hernia surgery from an operation requiring hospitalization and long recuperation into an uncomplicated outpatient procedure died june 11 at his home in marina del rey calif he was 80 the cause was parkinson 's disease his family said dr lichtenstein announced his new procedure in 1964 to the dismay of many in the medical establishment for a century before that surgeons had regarded the repair of hernias which occur when tissues protrude through a weakened area of muscle wall as a straightforward not especially interesting procedure with a basic technique hardly worth revisiting a patient was admitted to the hospital and on the day of surgery given general anesthesia a surgeon made an incision into the appropriate area of the abdomen and sewed the tear back together with sutures designed not to dissolve the patient stayed in the hospital as long as a week and was then sent home forbidden to work for about two months the thinking was that if the patient exerted himself too soon the tear would recur dr lichtenstein however said that both the prolonged bed rest and the general anesthesia were unnecessary and that the anesthesia was even counterproductive to prove this point he insisted that many of his patients walk away from the table after surgery my dad loved drama his daughter leslie lichtenstein of los angeles said that was dramatic dr lichtenstein who was long active in the american civil liberties union of southern california also loved a good battle and he got one when he stood in front of a thousand doctors attending an american medical association meeting in san francisco in 1964 and told them they were handling hernia patients all wrong a 1986 article in a magazine published by dr lichtenstein 's alma mater mcp hahnemann university school of medicine in pennsylvania recounted how he had been peppered by angry questions at the meeting when dr lichtenstein 's time was up the program director eager to get things rolling again suggested that those who still had questions take them into the hallway hundreds did so i was shocked dr lichtenstein remembered so many people followed physicians were shouting questions at me criticizing me challenging me there was a great deal of confusion and disorganization in truth dr lichtenstein had done little at least initially to change the basic way hernias were treated with some minor modifications like using a stronger suture material he was performing a 100 year old technique developed by edoardo bassini an italian surgeon it was on the question of how long patients needed to recover that he broke new ground he exploded the myth of not letting the patient do any physical activity for two months said dr parviz k amid director of the lichtenstein hernia institute which was founded in 1984 dr lichtenstein focused on hernia operations only after becoming interested in the broader issue of how wounds heal in the late 1950 's while he was teaching at ucla medical school and working at what is now known as cedars sinai medical center he watched as a gallbladder patient he had just sewn up began to retch violently remarkably the incision did not reopen and dr lichtenstein began to wonder about the reliability of the information he and untold others had been given about wound healing over the next several years dr lichtenstein established that in animals a properly sutured tear immediately regained 70 percent of its strength and that what mattered most was how it was sewn up and what material was used to test his ideas on humans he settled on hernia patients since their injuries were generally confined to the tear itself he used local instead of general anesthesia so that the patients would be able to follow his instructions on the table he would have them cough for example to test the strength of the repair although dr lichtenstein reported high success rates it took years for his practices to be widely adopted it was only about two decades later in part because of pressure from managed care to control costs that they became truly widespread outpatient treatment for hernias is now normal practice almost a million of the procedures are performed each year mostly on men in the meantime dr lichtenstein worked to refine the surgery devising simpler suture techniques and using mesh screens to reduce the risk of the hernia 's recurring dr lichtenstein 's practice was in beverly hills he stopped operating about 18 years ago as a result of parkinson 's disease irving lester lichtenstein was born on feb 21 1920 in
