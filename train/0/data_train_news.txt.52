 the question was about what mike hampton has learned this year about how he has changed hampton a left handed pitcher for the mets was about to let a visitor into his world which does not happen too often i 'm probably just better prepared to handle a lot of things he said this has been a growing experience all around not only is the situation magnified in new york but being in the playoffs and going this far has been a lot more pressure games you find out a little bit about yourself and how you 're going to react in those situations what hampton was asked has he learned about himself at this question hampton retreated shutting the door to his thoughts access denied man you ca n't just write my diary and everything hampton said it 's just stuff people wo n't understand understanding hampton has been a difficult task for his teammates and coaches as well as those who follow the team he does not talk about where he will be next season whether he will stay in new york or leave as a free agent that question looms over him as it did over mike piazza two years ago the players are aware of hampton 's pending decision and they do not know what it will be i 'm proud to have played with him said piazza the catcher i do n't know if it 'll be only this year but that remains to be seen he 's obviously a main reason why we 're here the mets would probably not be in the world series without hampton who went 15 10 and was the most valuable player of the national league championship series in which he beat st louis twice with 16 shutout innings but for a while it seemed as if the mets could not win with him hampton walked nine on opening day in japan he pummeled the water coolers in the dugout at colorado 's coors field after his last start in april when he struggled again five days later in san francisco he walked back to the team hotel alone finding solace in his thoughts and putting his struggles in perspective his record stood at 2 4 with a 652 earned run average in his 29 starts since then including the postseason hampton is 15 7 with a 237 era he righted himself by himself i was still new to the team so it was something i had to deal with myself he said i knew they felt for the way that i was throwing and always had confidence in me but it was just something i had to deal with on my own al leiter a fellow left hander did not know hampton when hampton played for houston he remembered him as stone faced an intense competitor not big on small talk or hugs behind the batting cage with opponents leiter who struggled early in '99 before finishing strong knew he could only subtly encourage his new teammate any time a guy 's struggling everybody from everywhere is trying to give you their remedy to fix it leiter said and really internally you pretty much know what you have to do that you have n't been doing mike is confident in the ability that he has and he was able to right himself by staying the course generally it comes down to a confidence thing you lose your confidence you start throwing balls you 're in hitters counts you 're not being as aggressive hampton 's confidence is extraordinary and after his performance in the nlcs it will be soaring when he takes the mound at yankee stadium for game 2 tomorrow he is open to suggestions saying he will keep learning for the rest of his life but interaction with hampton is much on his terms the pitching coach dave wallace said and supreme confidence is necessary to that approach that is fine wallace said even if not many pitchers are like that you just encourage him talk to him try to be the part that he allows you to be wallace said he 's pretty guarded in who he lets in and who he does n't somewhere around the middle of may or so your sense is that this is pretty nice and it 's working ok but you ca n't force yourself on anybody as a coach wallace gets help from veterans like leiter who enjoys talking about pitching philosophy with younger members of the staff hampton helps too wallace said although less with philosophy and more with mind set the left hander glendon rusch remembers throwing with hampton before spring training and being pleased with how open and friendly he was rusch and hampton have completely different styles hampton would rather give up a walk than a hit rusch the reverse but rusch has learned from him one thing i 've learned is i do n't have to give in as much rusch said it 's made me tougher to know that i can make my pitches be confident in myself and do that at any time in the count any part of the game that confidence has spread to the rest of the team whatever the mets know about hampton they know this when he pitches he gives them a great chance to win that is a major reason general manager steve phillips traded for hampton the mets needed another top of the rotation starter and the swagger that such a pitcher would bring oftentimes the feel you have going into the game has an impact on the way you play phillips said masato yoshii pitched well for us but it was n't the same feel of having mike hampton starting the game the mets have never been more confident in hampton than they were in his last start on monday in game 5 of the nlcs his teammates sensed an even greater concentration than usual before hampton pitched them to the pennant allowing three hits that was a different sort of focus than i 'd ever seen the left hander bobby m jones said he was n't saying a whole lot the tv was on but he was n't looking at it it was like he was looking through the tv wallace saw that determination but he also saw a polished fastball breaking ball and changeup in hampton 's pregame bullpen session it was evident warming up 'whoa ok the stuff is there wallace recalled now it was going to be a matter of catching breaks and making pitches a lot of times just because the stuff is there does n't mean a guy 's going to have a real good outing the tendency is to think 'well i 've got my good stuff and you forget to pitch hampton remembered how to pitch and won the most important game of his life even more important is the game that comes next if hampton learned something about himself from the last one only he knows nobody but hampton can write that entry in the diary
