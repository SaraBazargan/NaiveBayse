 to the editor i just reopened my own personal grochowski file mine was for a fridge whose freezer stopped working on the hottest day of 1999 the smell of mold and rotting food was terrifying i also made endless efforts at phoning writing and beseeching the man had made me pay in cash and i did since i was desperate i reported it to my home insurance company and they reimbursed me for my expense to the ny refrigeration company and for the legitimate repairman i eventually used the insurer did n't even ask for any documentation when i reported it to the better business bureau they were actually helpful and said that our friend mr g had 23 complaints against him already and that i should have called them first then they sent me to consumer affairs who told me to go to small claims court the judge ruled in my favor laughed and said lots of luck gregg winter manhattan
