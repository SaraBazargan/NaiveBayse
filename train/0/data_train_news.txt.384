 people used to say they were busy busy busy now they say they 're multitasking in the olympics the decathlon is a sport in the office trying to do 10 things at once is a trial multitasking is the only task jenny mckinney of san francisco knows on sept 3 she and her husband bruce working with a staff of six people spread across seven states and working out of their homes established a database web site of bibliographies historical and current book auction records and prominent book dealer catalogs mr mckinney 's concept was to help dealers of rare books become more efficient by giving them quick access to titles and prices and to help book collectors by making them aware of titles on the market and price history libraries that have rare book collections would also benefit my husband 's motivation to start this business was that this was an extremely smart and logical concept mrs mckinney writes everyone ought to embrace it after the launch not only did dealers not like it libraries were indifferent to it and collectors are nowhere in sight within a month three staff members quit mrs mckinney writes i am on the job with the following multitasks in charge of bookkeeping payroll coding articles published monthly on our web site updating database maintaining an e mailing list designing promotional material and making date entries when i have free time additionally our web site is going through many phases of software additions and modifications mrs mckinney is responsible for ensuring that results are logical functional and otherwise user friendly during her free time she manages an investment portfolio for her sister and herself and is the mother of a 16 year old daughter and a 17 year old son my office is in the corner of our kitchen she says who do you think is doing the cooking laundry grocery shopping etc can i tell anyone that i am only one person so far no one has lent me his or her ears i hope you do every day i find myself doing something like checking e mail while talking on my office phone while unjamming the fax machines while trying to pick up the ringing cellphone susan hay cramer writes from missoula mont where she is a consultant on management and governance for local and national nonprofit organizations for me the biggest challenge in terms of job performance is balancing the time i spend marketing myself and my services with the time i spend doing the actual work for which organizations hire me she says my biggest reality check was realizing that about 50 percent of my time is unbillable no one pays me to buy office supplies or execute a dynamite marketing presentation or update my web site or unjam the fax machine but she adds i may be someone who thrives on multitasking so how does she handle it all i write down others would use a palm pilot i 'm sure absolutely everywhere i have to be everything i have to do and everyone i need to call because i 've learned the hard way that if i do n't write it down it does n't get done i carry a calendar both on my laptop my constant companion and a hard copy version in my purse and i 've learned also the hard way to compose all e mail to clients and prospects offline and then send it to avoid erroneous or embarrassing transmissions ms cramer says i 'd write more but i have a conference call with a client during which time i will also be sorting laundry and packing for a trip out of town henry dubroff had a dream in 1999 he was a business journalist working as the editor of the denver business journal his dream was to own a newspaper company so he quit his job and moved to santa barbara calif with a start up kit a leased saab a checkbook and a business plan today he is the chairman chief executive principal owner president publisher and editor of pacific coast business times which he describes as a thriving business journal that serves santa barbara ventura and san luis obispo counties one of his first lessons he writes was that our company 's success depended very heavily on my ability to multitask i have negotiated leases in the morning and edited real estate stories in the afternoon mr dubroff says i have sold ads over breakfast and written columns in the dead of night i have delivered newspapers and met the payroll and when the ad crunch hit in 2001 we had to let 6 of our 16 people go in order to keep the company afloat that was hard things are better now and my multitasking has evolved these days my most important job is to keep our team of 10 people happy and motivated job no 2 is to operate the company more or less within our budget but i have learned to make it fun recently i took the company credit card to one of santa barbara 's many thrift stores and for less than 25 i brought back 28 corningware plates and a mixed collection of stainless steel dinnerware that more or less serves 12 the result was a triple win first we will never again use paper plates at our semiregular company 'festivals second the new dishwasher that the landlord installed in the kitchen see lease negotiations above is being put to good use third the long term quality of life around the office has been kicked up a couple of notches for thousands of small business owners like me multitasking is n't just about doing e mail and voice mail at the same time that 's the easy stuff the hard stuff is doing whatever needs to be done to make the business go years ago when robin a kroft was looking for her first job after college in toronto a friend 's mother looked her squarely in the eye and said whatever you do never admit you know how to type as a woman you will always have more earning power that encounter says dr kroft who now lives in baltimore and whose expertise is in philanthropic studies occurred before keyboarding at a computer made acceptable the notion that brains and typing could go hand in hand dr kroft writes recently after the economy claimed a major donor it became necessary to downsize the research foundation where i am a vice president faced with the challenge of running a grant program without secretarial support i was pushed to call upon my closely held typing skills she said she had managed to teach herself how to create a special type of computerized letter that only the most revered support staff members had mastered i wanted to celebrate by taking myself out to lunch on secretary 's day she said except i did n't have time
