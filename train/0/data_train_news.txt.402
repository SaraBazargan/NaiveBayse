 a sedan slithered through the traffic down broadway on an indelicate approach to times square in the face of the halogen spectacle the passenger marat safin snapped out of his groggy state flung open his eyes like shutters and absorbed the plunge into a mosh pit of celebrity surrounding safin a 20 year old russian were models on billboards jostling with morning show icons pictured on big screens above the street and blown up sitcom stars bumping against an mtv set where squealing teenagers wave at rock stars not long after his passage through america 's addiction to pop culture safin was amazed and a little amused although he has j crew good looks to go with his no 6 seeding at the united states open safin is from a country where he moves without notice from restaurants to discos and from shops to airports in russia people do n't go 'oh there he is safin said with a smile during an interview in midtown on friday there is no screaming in america you like more show you like big things here andre agassi you see him on tv he 's hot russia it is colder reaction americans like hot things we do n't have 100 programs in russia it 's only in the united states you have 100 channels of course in the hotel there are 20 channels but also pay tv here it 's tv tv tv here ratings are used to measure a sport 's worth for years agassi and pete sampras have been the pontoons for the popularity of men 's tennis today the united states open begins with the tantalizing possibility of a sampras agassi semifinal next week but the life span of this rivalry is nearing its end no one seems inspired to fill the void there have been six no 1 's in this year 's atp champions race a system that was designed to create fan interest by counting results from jan 1 that has actually left fans more confused than ever still the system aside no player has performed consistently enough to be a favorite to reach the open final much less capture the public 's imagination if the tiger woods phenomenon has reinforced anything it is that people are mesmerized by domination as if to manufacture a star on the tour and do it before an american audience over the next two weeks the atp has begun a campaign new balls please to promote the next generation yesterday spain 's juan carlos ferrero ecuador 's nicolas lapentti germany 's tommy haas and brazil 's gustavo kuerten were escorted into an interview room and lined up as tightly as piano keys for pictures and questions pete and andre are the guys that make things happen haas said we are like they say the next generation we 're young guys we still have a lot to learn with time hopefully we 're going to be the next people to talk about the colorful kuerten with his bandanna blond curls and barbed wire physique is the one voted most likely to succeed but if kuerten a two time french open winner is to advance his popularity in america he will have to perform on a hard court and get through a tricky draw in his quarter patrick rafter a two time winner at this event and mark philippoussis are looming kuerten has personality and he 's well liked the television analyst john mcenroe said he 's got a lot of drive you do n't see the other guys are unpredictable pete and andre are still going to be there for a couple of years but there are not a lot of other guys right now safin is one of the unknown variables after a forgettable 5 11 start to the season and through 48 rackets broken during fits of frustration the 6 foot 4 inch safin has won 40 of his last 50 matches to usher him toward a coming out party at the open he has a favorable path in his quarter of the draw with third seeded magnus norman posing the major threat safin of course does not want to discuss his fortuitous draw you know how many guys think this is their moment he said all 128 want to win and become a star although he is resistant to the characterization safin has star qualities he has a sense of humor that squeezes through the cracks in his unpolished english and a powerful game that at times falls short on control he is talented and tanned but sometimes appears to be teetering on a philippoussis like line for several years the australian 's performance was diluted by his fast paced bachelor 's life safin believes his night life is within the norm usually at night i like to have a drink or have a beer safin said but right now when i 'm at tournaments i have to stay in my room and try to do things in the right way and i have to be nice to myself get rest on most days he likes to sleep until noon on friday a prank call awoke safin at 9 am and it was hard to recover but even in a weary state safin was eager to discuss any subject from politics to poverty and when asked about his budding popularity he did not seem moved by the hype if anything he knows humility safin grew up in moscow during political upheaval when tennis balls were considered a luxury item it was a difficult time he said there was nothing in the shops it was difficult to find even good cheese and to get sugar was a big problem if you do n't have shops that have food how are you going to have tennis balls and rackets how could he develop at all when safin was 14 his parents made the difficult decision to pack their son 's belongings and send him to spain although he lived with a sponsor and trained with a coach safin was lonely and too poor to join his friends at restaurants of course at the beginning you say 'where 's my family where 's my mother where 's my father and my sister safin said but after a few weeks you start to become a normal person you realize this is it this is how the career started for safin this was the beginning for one member of tennis 's generation next just how familiar the public becomes with his story will unfold this week if grand slam fame strikes safin will not give stardom a second thought why should you have to prepare for it he said you move to another level raise your ranking but you are still living in the same world you walk on the street with everyone with the people maybe there is a lot of media a lot of attention but so what nothing should change
