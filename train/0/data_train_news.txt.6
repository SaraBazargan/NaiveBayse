 seeming ever more frail pope john paul ii beatified mother teresa of calcutta on sunday as an icon of the good samaritan declaring her close to sainthood before tens of thousands of worshipers in st peter 's square the two hour ceremony said as much about the pope 's vitality though as it did about the memory of mother teresa whose image of devotion to the sick and needy has become an emblem of selflessness and piety with our apostolic authority we grant that the venerable servant of god teresa of calcutta shall from now on be called blessed the pope said in latin his voice was halting and indistinct as he pronounced mother teresa the latest of the more than 1300 people he has beatified in his 25 year tenure a huge portrait of mother teresa a nobel peace prize winner sometimes called the saint of the gutters for her work in calcutta was unfurled on the great facade of st peter 's basilica showing her smiling and deeply wrinkled her greatness lies in her ability to give without counting the cost to give 'until it hurts the pope 's homily said her life was a radical living and a bold proclamation of the gospel i am personally grateful to this brave woman who i always felt was at my side the sermon said though the words illuminated the pope 's feeling for mother teresa 's example the manner of their delivery betrayed his frailty for the first time on a major occasion the pope did not read a single line of his homily leaving it to cardinal ivan dias of bombay and others to speak for him when he said prayers in latin moreover his voice slurred to the point where his words were hard to understand senior aides also took over from him in saying mass when his voice weakened and tailed off people who have watched him closely in recent years said that the pope seemed particularly tired perhaps because he is midway through an intense series of public appearances those began with the celebrations of his quarter century as pope last thursday and are set to culminate on tuesday in the confirmation of 31 new cardinals the ceremonies on sunday blended the vatican 's solemnity with less austere moments indian women in white and gold saris bearing flowers swayed before the canopied altar on the steps of st peter 's basilica to music played on tabla and harmonium within the huge crowd said by the police to number 300000 although other estimates put the figure lower some people lauded the pope 's courage in defying the increasingly evident symptoms of parkinson 's disease others saw the remarkable spectacle of his physical decline as inspirational from his suffering and his humanity we can see his holiness said elena pelli a 19 year old italian law student in bright sunlight after a night of rain the pope was wheeled to an altar below the basilica on an upholstered chair and after the ceremony seemed to rally slightly as he was driven through the crowd in an open popemobile with few of the security trappings that usually surround figures of global stature beatification may be granted by the roman catholic church to a person who is seen as having been of overwhelming virtue whose goodness has been sustained after death and who is deemed to have interceded from beyond the grave in a miracle usually a medical cure for which there is said to be no scientific explanation once beatified the blessed and relics associated with them may be venerated the pope was presented on sunday with a piece of cloth stained with mother teresa 's blood that is to be displayed this week in a roman church for veneration beatification usually leads to sainthood once there is evidence of a second miracle mother teresa was born in 1910 in skopje now the capital of macedonia a former yugoslav republic she died in 1997 after spending most of her life in calcutta living in poverty as she ministered to the poorest and least privileged she founded her order the missionaries of charity in 1950 with 12 nuns it now has 4500 sisters in more than 130 countries like mother teresa the nuns wear the simple white saris edged in blue that were once associated with the street sweepers of calcutta from the earliest hours on sunday people began gathering in st peter 's square and along the wide via della conciliazione leading to it some brought their own sick in wheelchairs hoping for miracles others relished the sense of occasion that vatican officials are skilled at building among the crowd many waved red and black albanian flags to honor mother teresa 's origins although the claim to her memory is disputed between albanian and macedonian nationalists presidents princes dignitaries and politicians from 27 countries including the united states attended the open air ceremony the week of ecclesiastical events surrounding the beatification has been closely choreographed to ensure its impact not only do the church 's scarlet robed cardinals lend a sense of gravity and occasion but the timing of mother teresa 's beatification which drew bigger numbers than the pope 's own anniversary mass on thursday virtually assured that pilgrims would flood here from around the world this is like witnessing the faith of so many people said cathy o'donnell 48 who had traveled from stephens city va some in the crowd said they believed the pope had scheduled the events so close together because he sensed that time was running out perla godino 21 an italian art student said he is a great pope who wants to do things in his way and added he is bringing his mission to its completion pope john paul ii 's papacy has set records not only for beatifications but also for sainthoods the pope has canonized more than 470 new saints since he took office those who gathered for the ceremony dismissed suggestions by the pope 's critics that he had bent the church 's rules by permitting mother teresa 's supporters to complete the processes leading to beatification so soon after her death usually five years must elapse before the process begins but the pope waived that requirement for mother teresa and approved a miracle last year curing an indian woman of a tumor said to be cancerous that some held to be contentious she was already a saint said lucielle hoyon 56 of paris
