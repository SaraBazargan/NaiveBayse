 joe torre clutched a baseball bat wrapped by a sanitary sock like a baby clinging to a rattle after the yankees secured their fourth straight american league east title on a surreal and subdued tuesday night at yankee stadium apparently the drained torre needed something to hang on to after an evening of retrospection and relief everyone needs something or someone these days long before the terrorist attacks changed our world two weeks ago the yankees usually hung on to torre the manager has shepherded them to three straight world series titles and four in the last five years with a relaxed confident approach that diminished the chaos that can envelop the yankees torre has been a constant a face to trust a voice to offer encouragement a leader to believe in he still is now in the sometimes unexplainable world of george steinbrenner torre 's future which is incredibly still tenuous could be determined by his players steinbrenner has offered a plethora of excuses for why he has not offered torre a contract extension but some people who have talked to the principal owner recently think he is waiting to see if the yankees win another championship before deciding torre 's fate shockingly the yankees might have to win it all to keep torre in the bronx that is no fantasy there is no other rational explanation for why torre who told friends that he hoped to sign a contract last march is still waiting the television network steinbrenner was so consumed with has been formed any issues about a new or improved stadium have been pushed aside because a wounded city needs to repair lower manhattan what is steinbrenner 's excuse for the delay now he must be waiting for torre to prove himself again i do n't think one has anything to do with the other torre said before the yankees defeated the tampa bay devil rays 5 1 last night at the stadium torre is fooling himself why else would steinbrenner have waited this long steinbrenner did not return a telephone call yesterday but torre said he expected to meet with him in tampa next week they met there last month but reported no progress torre initiated a meeting with steinbrenner in july then happily told reporters we both want it to happen and made it seem as if an agreement were imminent two months later the only thing that is imminent are more doubts about a manager who has helped make steinbrenner millions and helped make the yankees perennial winners torre claimed he is no longer anxious about his future because he knows he will have a job somewhere next year i 've gotten past that torre said yeah i have i really do n't know why but i have when torre was asked if he considers it strange that he is not signed yet he said yeah it is that 's all i can say i do n't know since torre is seeking between 5 million and 7 million a season and wants at least a three year contract steinbrenner is balking one club official said steinbrenner 's stalling tactics are all about gaining leverage but the official added that steinbrenner would be vilified if he ever allowed torre and general manager brian cashman another lame duck to leave they have been as successful as any duo in franchise history yet steinbrenner is making them twist like neophytes torre has already expressed his willingness to manage elsewhere if the yankees do not keep him or satisfy him a shrewd negotiating tactic if torre were available whoever purchases the red sox should sprint to hire him technically the boston manager joe kerrigan has more job security than torre since he is signed through 2003 obviously that is irrelevant still it is laughable that torre 's future is as uncertain as kerrigan 's this is too important a year to have anything else monopolize my time said torre acting like a diplomat some baseball officials have already heard buck showalter 's name linked with the yankees again a topic showalter has refused to discuss torre replaced showalter after the 1995 season and if anyone thinks the possibility of showalter returning is slim do not forget that steinbrenner tried to rehire showalter a few days after he hired torre bringing managers back is like riding a bicycle for steinbrenner he never forgets how to do it of course showalter would be walking on sizzling coals if he ever succeeded torre even if the yankees do not win the title this season the manager who replaces torre will be replacing someone known as teflon torre and st joe but showalter has told friends there is still something special to him about being a yankee an indication that he would agree to work for an owner he grew to loathe and to work in torre 's gargantuan shadow the yankees are trying to further seal their place in history by becoming the first team in almost five decades to win four straight titles they are trying to help a city cope by winning and providing a diversion from a tragedy and whether they realize it or not the yankees might also be trying to save torre 's job the mere thought of that is unbelievable
