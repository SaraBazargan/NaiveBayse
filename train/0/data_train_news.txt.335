 a powerful laser developed by israel and the united states to shoot down rockets has passed its first test at the white sands missile range in new mexico hitting a stationary target american military officials said this week if it is eventually deployed the system would apparently be the first antimissile defense of any kind based on lasers to my knowledge no nation has ever deployed an antimissile system based on a laser said lt col rick lehner a spokesman for the ballistic missile defense organization at the pentagon designed and built by a california contractor trw for israel and the united states army the laser and its tracking system were tested last week against stationary targets said lt gen john costello commander of the united states army space and missile defense command general costello said the system the tactical high energy laser would probably be tested this month against a moving katyusha rocket if that test is successful he said the system will be shipped to israel for further testing and deployment it will be the first engagement of the katyusha rocket by a tactical high energy laser something that is militarily useful the general said the israeli defense ministry said it planned to deploy the system along its northern border to shoot down guerrilla rockets after israel withdraws from lebanon in the summer a spokesman for the ministry dan weinreich said the weapon was in the final stages of testing in the united states and israel a spokesman for the space and missile defense command marco morales said the cost to develop the system through the first attempted shoot down was 190 million at a briefing this week in huntsville ala on missile defense general costello said developing the system over five years could in fact revolutionize warfare by protecting troops from rockets mortars and other artillery but he said using lasers in rain and fog needed special experiments the possible deployment of the laser though its geographic range is modest represents a striking turnaround for an antimissile technology that was criticized as unworkable in the strategic defense initiative of the 1980 's since then most american antimissile systems have turned to hit to kill technology that means that a rocket propelled vehicle maneuvers toward an incoming missile to collide with and therefore destroy it but the united states military has also continued long term research and development on laser based systems those include the israeli american program for intercepting short range missiles an air force program to shoot ballistic missiles like iraqi scuds using a laser on a boeing 747 jumbo jet and a joint venture by the air force and the ballistic missile defense organization at the pentagon to develop lasers that could be fired from space to destroy intercontinental ballistic missiles all those lasers would derive their energy from powerful chemical reactions and destroy the missiles by heating them to high temperatures although the israeli american laser if successful would intercept rockets in the middle or end of their flights the others would try to destroy missiles earlier as their boosters fired the technology has come a long way since the early star wars days in terms of developing lasers that could in the future destroy a ballistic missile colonel lehner said the laser 's exact power range and repetition rate for firing are classified
