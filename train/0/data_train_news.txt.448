 julie harris is a theater star who has prevailed for more than 50 years if i were on a street corner and we had an audience she says there is no need for her to finish that sentence having emphasized the word audience she quickly adds what 's important to me is that there 's an audience that wants to hear a story such uncomplicated feelings explain why ms harris is a theater star perhaps the last great american theater star her contract with performing art has only one condition that there be an audience and in the old established now bygone tradition a theater star tours coming up nyack princeton and newark movies even opposite james dean in east of eden and television are mere detours that 's true even though it may not get much better than a prominent role in a prime time series that lasts seven years knots landing of the 1980 's not to mention scores of lavishly praised performances many emmy nominated with two awards including one last year for a voice over still ms harris said there 's nothing quite so marvelous as hearing words close and immediate and a theater star as tennessee williams said about a poet is in the business of illusion he made the point in the glass menagerie in which ms harris has played both laura the tremulous daughter to jessica tandy 's amanda and amanda the overwrought mother to calista flockhart 's laura last year when ms harris was asked to reprise her classic 1976 portrayal of emily dickinson the 19th century poet in the belle of amherst the fifth of her five tony awards she wondered whether she was too old emily was 53 she recalled thinking then i 'll be 75 those 20 years or so are nothing in an actor 's life she said this is not about age it 's about the wonder and beauty of her work after all julie harris was 24 when she played the lonely adolescent frankie addams her breakout role in the member of the wedding in 1950 an interviewer recalled that frankie was 12 ms harris is devoted to precision twelve and three quarters she said the actress has come back to belle with passion renewed last february at lincoln center she acted the role in my business is to love a musical resetting of dickinson 's words with renee fleming as her singing counterpart on tuesday ms harris is to give the first of eight performances of the belle of amherst william luce 's one woman play at the helen hayes performing arts center in nyack the first show is a benefit for the clear view school for emotionally disturbed young people in briarcliff manor the school has a theater named for ms harris who lived in irvington in the 1970 's when the school rented space in dobbs ferry since the school 's move to briarcliff manor in 1981 ms harris has given four performances there including one of belle the current tour began in october in seattle and is to end in newark on april 15 on april 10 the belle of amherst is to play at the mccarter theater in princeton seven performances beginning april 11 are to follow at the new jersey performing arts center when she was reached by phone last week ms harris was taking time out for a series of seven staged readings of lillian hellman 's autumn garden in los angeles but wait los angeles is not on this tour 's circuit no matter ms harris had the week off and what better way to spend it than to do a play she did the same thing last spring between one play or another she was at her home on cape cod the recent irish prize winner the beauty queen of leenane was being put on in a small theater nearby in wellfleet ms harris was in it when she was recently asked by a newspaper columnist what would you do if the world came to an end tomorrow she answered i 'd go to the theater she did not specify whether she would be onstage or in the audience say simply that if she 's not in it she sees it and her life in theater is not just an acceptance but also her own affirmation of changed times the theater world was different when ms harris was officially declared a star it was official ritualized by a name going up in lights above the theater and elevated in the program and in the advertisements from below to above a play 's title that 's how it was in 1952 when she performed in the play i am a camera now remembered mostly as the source of the musical cabaret it may be history but ms harris was the first sally bowles on screen too and it made her a theater star but not a movie star theater was then defined by broadway where ms harris starred in play after play decade after decade alas the grand empire theater where she played frankie addams no longer stands although amazingly she can still return to broadway most recently in the 1997 revival of the gin game her 10th tony nomination theater is no longer just a broadway thing in fact she toured in the gin game for the next two years ms harris goes where theater is wherever theater is in 1999 she starred in scent of the roses a new play at the theater in nyack it would be a great film role for judi dench she said why not a great film role for julie harris i 'm not a bankable name she said i 'm a theater star and she laughed the inimitable julie harris laugh the belle of amherst helen hayes
