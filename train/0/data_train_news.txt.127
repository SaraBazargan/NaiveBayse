 the scoreboard operator welcomed the mets back to shea stadium by playing the memorable scene in which dorothy finally gets to go home in the wizard of oz there was judy garland her eyes closed sweetly and hopefully saying there 's no place like home but the mets did not prove that last night being home felt much like being on the road again for the mets in their troubling 6 4 defeat to the marlins it was another game in which they could not beat ryan dempster in which one of their starters put them in too deep a hole in which they did not produce in crucial situations and in which surprise surprise rickey henderson failed to hustle and created a new controversy so even though the mets were back at shea stadium the developments and the results were quite similar to those from their grueling and sluggish 5 8 road trip the mets were still searching for consistency when they returned to flushing but they did not find any as the marlins destroyed glendon rusch in coasting to a six run cushion before hanging on for the victory henderson coasted in the first by going into his home run trot prematurely perhaps costing the mets a run and making himself look silly when he was held to a single after the ball hit off the fence the 30828 fans at shea showered henderson with boos for the rest of the night and manager bobby valentine reprimanded the embattled leadoff hitter who was placed on waivers this week i told him it was not acceptable an angry valentine said hit it 400 feet before you pull that it might have been a different story if we had gotten off to a quick lead but valentine 's words apparently did not influence henderson who called questions about his trot ridiculous and who was noticeably tense as he sparred with reporters henderson said that it did n't matter that valentine criticized his behavior and defiantly said that he would not change i 'm going to do it again if i hit one like that henderson said does that answer your question i 've been doing it all my life ai n't nothing going to change about it the most exasperating thing about henderson for the mets is that he can still be an effective catalyst with the mets trailing by 6 0 in the fifth he walked stole second and scored on derek bell 's ground rule double mike piazza followed with a two run homer into the right field corner and robin ventura smashed dempster 's next pitch into the right field bullpen suddenly the score was 6 4 and the mets had life henderson walked and bell doubled off dempster with one out in the sixth but piazza and ventura both struck out the mets also stranded the potential tying runs in the eighth when piazza tapped out to first they finished 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position rusch had allowed two or fewer earned runs in four of his five starts as a pleasant surprise in the rotation but he was ineffective last night the marlins did not just get 12 hits off rusch they hit rockets off him preston wilson ripped a three run homer and derrek lee hammered a shot over the picnic area in left in a four run fifth that made it 6 0 henderson began the first by lining dempster 's second pitch to left field but henderson quickly turned a positive into a negative in rickeyesque fashion henderson flipped his bat aside put his head down and started a home run trot the only problem was that the ball hit off the bottom of the fence by the time henderson jogged to first cliff floyd had already fielded the carom henderson 's lack of hustle impacted the inning instead of having a runner on second base with no outs the mets only had a runner on first against a pitcher who threw a one hitter against them six days ago henderson took second on bell 's hit and run grounder but piazza and ventura failed to knock him in it was an awful way to start a homestand according to everyone except henderson i should n't have been running no harder than i ran henderson said i thought the ball was out of the ballpark that 's it no i should n't have run no harder but henderson did run harder when he popped to left in the third and for the rest of the night still henderson 's late hustle was too late for the mets who would have been much happier to be back home if rickey had run and they had won it was n't an act of not hustling valentine said about henderson it was an act of misjudgment that was n't a good looking act that 's for sure inside pitch melvin mora cut the tip of his right index finger while bunting for a hit required four stitches and was placed on the disabled list after the game joe mcewing a utility player was recalled from class aaa norfolk edgardo alfonzo did not start because of a sore right calf but he entered the game after mora 's injury pat mahomes will start today 's game
