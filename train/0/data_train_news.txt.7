 when senator john mccain had a routine checkup for skin cancer on july 27 a few days before the republican convention dr john f eisold the attending physician of the united states capitol spotted a mole on his patient 's left temple and told him you ought to have that checked the checkup was one of many regular exams mr mccain has undergone since he had a malignant melanoma removed from his left shoulder in 1993 the doctors had pronounced him cured of that melanoma but it is too soon to know how serious the new one on his temple will be after the recent checkup mr mccain moved swiftly on aug 1 after speaking at the convention in philadelphia the senator took the train to washington two days later he went to bethesda naval medical center in maryland where doctors detected another suspicious mole on his left upper arm and performed a biopsy on each mole that evening mr mccain returned to the convention and wore a bandage over part of his left temple when he appeared on stage with gov george w bush the republican presidential nominee a week later on aug 10 mr mccain learned in a call from bethesda that the moles were new malignant melanomas mr mccain who later said he was surprised by the diagnosis then arranged to have a second opinion and additional tests performed through dr john d eckstein his personal physician at the mayo clinic here on saturday mr mccain had a five and a half hour operation to remove the two melanomas and lymph nodes in his head and neck today as mr mccain 63 recovers at the mayo clinic hospital here he is awaiting a determination by pathologists on whether the temple melanoma has spread preliminary tests before and during surgery indicated that the cancer was confined to the skin his doctors said the quickness with which mr mccain and his doctors reacted in the last three weeks contrasts sharply with a similar situation in 1993 at that time it took more than six months before mr mccain sought care after a navy doctor recommended that he consult a dermatologist for what turned out to be his first melanoma the one removed from his left shoulder mr mccain 's experience with the more than six month delay in 1993 led him to act much faster this time and the episode in 1993 underlies the senator 's repeated urging that other people get checked for skin cancer for instance mr mccain stood in front of his home on friday after undergoing tests at the hospital to emphasize the benefits of detecting melanomas and other cancers at an early stage when they are most curable the delay in 1993 was documented in the hundreds of pages of medical records mr mccain released during the presidential primary campaign and was verified in interviews with his doctors the records included the annual checkups that mr mccain underwent as a volunteer in the program for all former prisoners of war that the military conducts in pensacola fla the pensacola doctors spotted a dark irregularly shaped area of skin on mr mccain 's left shoulder during a checkup on may 7 1993 but the records show they did not suspect a melanoma a letter from a navy doctor dated june 8 1993 recommended that mr mccain consult a dermatologist for what the pensacola doctors said they thought was a noncancerous condition actinic keratosis which results from chronic sun exposure it was not until nov 24 1993 that mr mccain sought care for the skin condition he went to dr thomas m hudak a plastic surgeon in phoenix who had treated mr mccain 's wife cindy dr hudak said in an earlier interview that though the dark area on the skin was not an obvious melanoma he suspected it was a cancer after years of seeing many lesions like this it just sort of caught my eye dr hudak said the melanoma had escaped the eye of dr eckstein mr mccain 's personal physician who said in an interview that he did n't recognize it if it was there when he examined mr mccain in 1992 undoubtedly it was there dr eckstein said the reasons for the delay in 1993 are not clear now said nancy ives mr mccain 's press secretary but ms ives said that mr mccain might have put off seeking medical care in part because of a heavy speaking schedule on behalf of other republicans because individuals with one melanoma can develop more they are advised to have periodic checkups dr hudak said he had removed several noncancerous moles from mr mccain 's skin including one from his left temple on oct 4 1998 it was a type known as a pigmented junctional nevus mr mccain recalled on friday that the new melanoma appeared near the spot where the benign mole had been melanomas can occasionally go undetected in a biopsy for many reasons one is misdiagnosis a second reason is disagreement among pathologists in interpreting what they see through a microscope if you send slides of a suspected melanoma to a dozen dermatologists some will call it normal and some will read it as a melanoma said dr bernard s goffe a dermatologist in seattle that 's a well known fact a third reason is that pathologists do not examine every millimeter of the tissue removed in a biopsy they take representative sections from different areas thus a melanoma that is confined to a small area of a mole may escape examination as a result of sampling errors when a new melanoma is detected in an area where a mole was removed and diagnosed as benign doctors usually review the microscopic slides to determine if the melanoma was present but missed in the initial testing dr eckstein said on saturday that no evidence of a melanoma had been detected in such a review of the mole that was removed from mr mccain in 1998 even early detection of melanomas is not foolproof because such cancers can be quirky recurring suddenly and unexpectedly decades after they are first detected yet when such metastases have occurred many people have gone on for years without further medical problems and sometimes a melanoma can first develop in the bowel or brain without ever having appeared on the skin scientists do not know why melanomas can behave so peculiarly
