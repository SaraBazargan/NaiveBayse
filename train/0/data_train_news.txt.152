 aaron williams shook his head and scrunched his nose he 's not in favor of his new nickname the beast i do n't know where they got that he said softly shrugging his monstrous shoulders a motion akin to silent thunder nah a train that 's my nickname the a train decidedly a local has made seven stops in the national basketball association in seven years most recently arriving here with the nets at 29 with a wife and 1 year old daughter williams hopes his 6 year 17 million contract will ensure that new jersey is his last stop he has been a reserve power forward everywhere his personality matching his position and will return to play one of his former teams the washington wizards wednesday night still comfortable in his role the coaches of his most recent teams washington and seattle have been impressed by his defensive talent but frustrated by his inconsistency three games into this season though nets coach byron scott does not share that view this kid is good he 's a lot better than people thought he was scott said he can be a presence down low in the box we thought if we can push him to think he can be a good offensive player and that got in his head then we 've got something scott then added with a smile and i think we do stephon marbury called williams the beast after a roaring awe inspiring dunk in practice one which williams replicated today in practice over the 7 foot center soumailia samake scott invoked the nickname after williams scored 20 points and pulled down 9 rebounds on opening night but williams considers such a fierce nickname ill fitting even if he is 6 feet 9 inches tall weighs 245 pounds and has arm muscles that ripple in statuesque abundance he bench presses 405 pounds he has 45 percent body fat williams 's nomadic career is curious for someone whose athletic talents are plain to see especially since his former coaches consider him likable respectful and coachable aaron has a load of talent said darrell walker who was the wizards interim coach last season and is now their director of player personnel but some nights he just floats on you then all of a sudden he 'll have a game that will make you go 'my god it was on that latter premise and his proven defensive abilities that the nets signed williams last summer to their 25 million exception more than he had ever made in the nba he went undrafted out of xavier university in 1993 bounced around overseas and in the continental basketball association for three years while picking up a series of 10 day nba contracts in 1997 he played in 32 games for vancouver before settling in for two seasons with seattle playing behind vin baker last season in 81 games with washington williams scored a career high 76 points a game averaged 19 minutes and led the team with 92 blocks washington wanted to re sign him and offered him a deal competitive with the nets but williams chose new jersey for its new direction and the minutes he could earn i 've never really had steady consistent playing time williams said it 's hard to be consistent when you do n't know if you 're going to play 5 minutes 30 minutes last year playing in washington i had more consistent minutes and that helped me get here walker pushed williams to reach his potential trying to make him consistently aggressive i called him into my office one day and said 'aaron it 's a shame that with your talent level compared to bo outlaw 's talent level he makes more money than you walker said not to take anything away from bo but aaron you should be mad at yourself but williams rarely gets mad he and his family have been living in a hotel for six weeks unable to find the right house the claustrophobia in a hotel room coupled with the area 's high real estate prices are about the only two things that truly make williams angry he says otherwise he is as laid back as a late summer day content in his quietude and in his role his introvertedness frustrates coaches said milwaukee bucks coach george karl who coached williams in seattle potentially you see the flamboyance you see his quick jumping ability but what 's frustrating is the mental toughness and consistency but karl thinks he has seen a change in williams he 's now moved into that 20 to 30 minute type of player karl said he is moving up a level scott hopes williams is ready to make that leap still after williams 's initial explosion in the season opener he got into foul trouble in the following game and scored only 4 points and had 7 rebounds he scored 6 of his 8 points from the line in the nets last game a loss to charlotte though his impact is often not reflected in statistics we have one guy right now who 's a presence and that 's aaron williams scott said he 's the only one who catches it deep and takes it to the basket we 've got to get more guys like that with the rookie forward kenyon martin struggling offensively shooting 11 for 36 with just one trip to the foul line scott is relying on williams designing more plays for him though williams has outplayed martin scott said he still wants to bring williams off the bench because he is accustomed to that role that 's fine with williams he is content with his long term security and the nets are encouraged with his improvement everybody has labeled him as a defensive player and a rebounder scott said we 're saying he can score too and we 're going to show you guys he can
