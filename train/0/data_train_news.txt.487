 barry bonds insisted he had no favorite world series memories indeed he never paid attention when he was growing up even though his father and his godfather were in the business as a child you have favorites bonds said when your favorites are n't in it you 're not watching it his father bobby an excellent player never reached the world series his godfather willie mays a great player never hit a home run in four world series last night barry bonds slugged one out in his first at bat to give his giants a running start in their 4 3 victory over the angels last year when he set the record with 73 home runs bonds was invited to throw out the first pitch of a series game as he recounted that memory the other day he made it sound as if he had merely been fulfilling an obligation for bonds the best and indeed the only way to encounter the world series is to take his powerful compact swing and propel the ball 418 feet over a distant fence and flip his bat casually and jog around the bases this was already an all barry all the time world series even before he came to the plate with his intelligence his haughty attitude bonds was dominating the series just by being here for the first time very much at his peak at the age of 38 now he has become only the 26th player to hit a home run on his first at bat in the world series and he has also accomplished something that ted williams that other great left fielder was not able to do in his only world series appearance in 1946 this was an instant world series memory for the red swathed fans clacking their ubiquitous plastic thunderstix celebrating the angels first world series in 41 years of existence the fans also saw j t snow of the giants who played four years here flop on his back while chasing a foul pop only to spring back up to catch the ball in front of the giants dugout the fans will remember his acrobatics and they will also remember his crushing two run homer an inning later but they clacked on incessantly like rabid red insects performing some weird mating call and the famed rally monkey pranced around on the message board the noise and the monkey are bound to be part of this world series memory too before the series began some of the angels had shared their personal world series memories mike scioscia the personable manager recalled being in catholic school and having a tv brought in and turned on so we could tune in to a little bit of the world series next day it was a radio he said it was an event not knowing the specifics of the players maybe at the time i was very young but knowing it was a world series and watching it it was incredible that 's my first recollection in the early part of the last century fans congregated in town squares or in front of railroad stations while the play by play came clicking across the western union wires people devised scoreboards and posted the results pitch after pitch then tv came along and fans could watch at home jarrod washburn who gave up bonds 's first series home run last night has been loving the postseason ever since he was verbally abused by the vicious hilarious knowledgeable fans before the first game in yankee stadium a few weeks ago now he has survived longer than the louts in the bronx and is living out the dreams of his childhood in northern wisconsin i grew up close to minneapolis and the metrodome washburn said with visible joy so '87 and '91 the twins kirby puckett viola hrbek that jumped catch against the wall that kirby made then gagne faking that guy those were some great world series to watch washburn never even mentioned kent hrbek 's forcing ron gant off first base with the sheer bulk of his body then tagging him for a vital out of the 1991 series against the braves a better pro wrestling move than the state 's future governor jesse ventura ever choreographed in his real career many players although not barry bonds watch the series even after they have reached the major leagues the postseason the playoff games they 're hit and miss admitted tim salmon the effervescent right fielder for the angels who like all his teammates is participating in his first world series you always try from your living room couch to imagine what it would be like playing in those situations in those games the energy the excitement salmon said salmon 's enthusiasm for the world series is a throwback to when the event was an all or nothing take it or leave it championship at the end of the regular season right through 1968 now there are 30 teams with 8 surviving into the postseason making the giants and the angels with all their newcomer energy the first two wild card teams to reach the world series together nowadays the world series never starts before the sun has long gone in the east and a whole generation of young people are asleep when the memories are being made late in the game bonds eventually struck out grounded out and received a timid four pitch bases on balls but this most magnanimous fellow gave everybody a quick and early world series memory last night
