 rite 13 begun as an episcopal version of the jewish bar and bat mitzvah ceremony originated in durham nc in the mid 1980 's at st philip 's church now more than 1200 episcopal and other protestant churches in the united states have adopted the rite according to the publisher that distributes the rite 13 program we were looking at the jewish tradition of bar and bat mitzvahs said the rev cathie caimono who runs the youth program at st philip 's we realized there were no established rites of passage for adolescents in our church and our culture we thought we wanted to do something similar for our kids until fairly recently the traditional age for confirming one 's baptismal vows in the episcopal church was 13 according to bishop catherine roskam of the episcopal diocese of new york it has been a growing trend at episcopal churches in the united states to confirm teenagers when they are between 14 and 18 most 13 year olds are n't ready to make that kind of commitment to religion she said rite 13 is a terrific program because when young people have been through rite 13 they are really ready to confirm their baptismal vows they know what they are doing another reason for the need for rite 13 is that the spiritual road traveled in adolescence tends to be tumultuous many worried parents and ministers say and often teenagers drift away from the church especially in the northeast their friends are being bar or bat mitzvahed said the rev stephen holton of st paul 's church in ossining which adopted rite 13 in fall 2000 our kids are saying 'hey we want something too so staff members at st philip 's designed a program meant for children and teenagers between the ages of 11 and 17 that includes religious training social service and discussion of sex and relationships topics covered include prayer poverty leadership and nonviolence rite 13 signifies the start of their journey to adulthood at the rite 13 service conducted sometimes for one child and sometimes for a group the child reads aloud from psalm 139 answers questions from the minister and receives a blessing with his or her parents standing behind much like a jewish child in a bar or bat mitzvah service after the blessing the child instead of sitting with his or her parents sits with other teenagers who have already undergone the rite while the rite 13 program was originally meant for episcopal youth other denominations presbyterian methodist baptist lutheran have bought the curriculum from its massachusetts based publisher leaderresources according to linda l grenz its executive director of the 100 episcopal dioceses in the united states 22 have licensed the curriculum
