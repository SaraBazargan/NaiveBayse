 dennis o'sullivan was an impressionable rookie last year the first thing he heard in the jets training camp was make sure the holder does n't have to twirl the laces for o'sullivan the idea of snapping a football while an opponent was trying to knock his helmet off was hard enough but to hike the ball with the laces facing up so that it could be spotted perfectly for the place kicker i said 'what are you nuts o'sullivan recalled today obviously not that 's what it takes to be a long snapper in the national football league during the off season o'sullivan displaced the team incumbent john hudson who the jets said never made a bad snap in four seasons about 600 attempts for punts extra points and field goals but o'sullivan comes cheaper he will earn 193000 the minimum for a first year player he was on the practice squad last year hudson would have earned the veteran minimum of 440000 that does not sound like much when millions are spent fielding a team but that much money is almost as much as your entire practice squad will earn said bill parcells the jets director of football operations the entire five man squad will cost about 300000 you take 250000 from here 250000 from there wherever you can get it because of the salary cap strictures hudson is back home on the farm in paris tenn snapping the ball every day and waiting for a phone call in case o'sullivan is injured or the youngster performs horribly saturday night in the third preseason game at baltimore o'sullivan expects to do the job though which will earn him more than 1000 a snap about 12000 a game i was just thinking today 'is there anything in sports similar to what i do o'sullivan said people ask me what i do and i tell them i 'm a football player but that i 'm also a long snapper and sometimes they do n't know what that means so i tell them i 'm the guy who throws the ball between his legs to the punter there is more to him than that though a graduate of tulane he was an intern for one summer for gov george pataki his mother ann a former councilwoman from stony point ny is a special assistant to the governor and recently took on the added duties of working closely with libby pataki the state 's first lady o'sullivan 's father jim is a retired new york city police officer i think working in the governor 's office has given me a sense that i like helping people said o'sullivan a graduate of north rockland high school in rockland county ny i 've been around politics a long time i worked on the governor 's campaign and i 've been intrigued with it at tulane he was a defensive lineman and a snapper the jets converted him to the offensive line he is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 285 pounds and he may actually see duties other than snapping the special teams coach mike sweatman said today that he is using o'sullivan on the wedge on kick returns hudson never played when he was not snapping indeed while all around him was chaos hudson calmly spread his legs on the sidelines and made make believe snaps it is unlikely o'sullivan will see any action as an offensive lineman though the jets have a very able first string unit and they have some depth there as well still in today 's two a day workouts in high heat and humidity o'sullivan worked with the offensive linemen as well as handled the snaps center kevin mawae is listed as the backup snapper but mawae has told the coaches that he does not want to snap the ball o'sullivan does most of the work explode sully do n't extend so much the line coach bill muir cautioned during the drills muir watches o'sullivan more closely than most in trying to create an nfl lineman i think he does a good job coach al groh said he 's a football player that 's the first thing to know about him o'sullivan has had one bad snap this summer a high ball to punter tom tupa in the opening preseason game against the saints tupa 's punt was returned for a touchdown o'sullivan claimed he has forgotten about the snap perhaps he has he 's not content to be just a snapper groh said football is still a game of toughness extra points left cornerback aaron glenn sprained his left ankle in the morning workout the jets did not indicate whether it would keep him out of saturday 's game if it does the rookie tony scott a sixth round pick might fill in he has moved up to starting nickel back the jets will travel to baltimore by train leaving friday the first time since at least 1963 the team will have taken a train according to a club spokesman linebacker courtney ledyard broke up a pass intended for mike stack actually it bounced off ledyard 's helmet way to use your head courtney coach al groh shouted meanwhile the top draft pick shaun ellis continues to get scolded at every opportunity by the defensive line coach ray hamilton
