 one oddity of election night 2000 some would call it a relief was that the four men who battered our eardrums in their quests for the presidency and vice presidency fell abruptly silent not a creature was stirring or accepting or conceding not even joe lieberman oops even this is not quite true a few connecticut ears did hear mr lieberman 's voice around 9 20 pm broadcast on speakers at the goodwin hotel in hartford where democrats had gathered to await the returns mr lieberman 's senior senate colleague united states senator christopher dodd ascended the podium and on the strength of the false florida projection incited not exactly a victory celebration but at least a sack dance then mr dodd announced a special treat over the speakers came mr lieberman 's voice advising as had mr dodd that nothing was settled but agreeing that things were looking awfully good thanking all concerned etc did n't do it alone etc so much love etc he were calling from what is known as a hold which is where they keep you if you 're so important that you have to be ushered out on stage at a certain time and too important to be seen loitering casually in the vicinity beforehand the hold is an apt metaphor for that very trying night in mr lieberman 's life for the days that followed it for the next four years of his career and for the fortunes of other connecticut figures whose futures hinged in great measure on the activities of clerks in obscure florida counties in year 2000 connecticut politics limbo has been the look of the season with the presidential election mess not quite resolved at the time of this writing there are more questions than there are answers but certain issues are inescapable mr lieberman 's national standing by most reckonings if the gore ticket loses mr lieberman is an automatic front runner in the 2004 democratic presidential hunt after all mr gore was at least 14 points down when he tapped mr lieberman and pulled up to parity and even the most merciless who lost florida analysis would have to concede that sans mr lieberman it would have easily been george w bush 's state on the other hand mr lieberman 's political style his cultural conservatism his chummy debate performance with opposite number dick cheney his fondness for public displays of religiosity may have worked better for a democratic second banana than it will for a top dog and the national press shows signs that its romance with mr lieberman is fading a little by the end of sunday oct 29 after making the rounds of the morning talk shows mr lieberman had taken some tough questions revealing that he might have voted to confirm robert bork as supreme court justice if he 'd been in the senate at the time and that although he supports abortion choice he would oppose it for his wife or daughters if gore loses says one party insider there 's going to be a lot of soul searching about what the party should be in 2004 mr lieberman 's mix of conservatism and piety may not be palatable to the larger democratic party he 'd have to change again says the democratic source mr lieberman in the state his performance during the summer and fall suggested that mr lieberman 's role in connecticut politics as vice president would closely parallel prince charles 's role in great britain largely symbolic and clouded with mixed feelings while running with mr gore mr lieberman evinced cheerful but limited interest in connecticut affairs including his own senate campaign he raised at least 25 million more than he needed to defeat the surmountable waterbury mayor phil giordano and if he had any thoughts of using the overage to help embattled state candidates these seem not to have been translated into action there has been low level grumbling among party insiders about this but then the party picked up seats in the state house and senate and had in general a very sunny election day save for the demise of united states representative sam gejdenson the phrase lieberman coattails is now spoken much more loudly than where was he in state polls indicate that the voters regard mr lieberman as a beloved if slightly prodigal son they disapproved of his dual candidacy but emphatically forgave him for it mr lieberman and mr dodd connecticut 's two senators maintain a cheery show of support and affability but a certain edginess underlies it mr dodd the senior senator has played the good sport but he has no stomach for living in mr lieberman 's shadow there are some early signs that the two men will begin carving out different roles with mr dodd taking the more active role in shaping the democratic political future in connecticut and mr lieberman seeking the washington limelight when mr dodd ascended the stage at the goodwin tuesday night he made a point of introducing two people who had worked behind the scenes the first was john olson head of the state afl cio the second was edward marcus the state party chairman mr olson had been moving around the state for months lining up votes for a challenge to mr marcus mr dodd who has opposed mr marcus in the past appeared to be making a point by introducing his rival first mr marcus in his remarks to the crowd noted that mr lieberman was going to be elected to the senate that night by the biggest margin in connecticut history eclipsing the record of chris dodd it was a needle pinking mr dodd in the raw wound of his new status as the second biggest gorilla in the connecticut senate delegation the next four years of connecticut democratic party life will play out like installments of i claudius who will win the olson marcus battle if there is one when it comes time to redistrict next year and the state loses a congressional seat will the democratic majority in the general assembly avenge mr gejdenson by eliminating the second district how will the ambitions of attorney general richard blumenthal united states representative rosa delauro the former gubernatorial candidate william curry bridgeport mayor joseph ganim secretary of state susan bysiewicz comptroller nancy wyman senate majory leader george jepsen and perhaps even the attorney ted kennedy jr be squeezed through that funnel where the prize seekers at the beginning far exceed prizes at the end in the spirit of i claudius and for that matter life in the hold many of these questions are interlinked ms bysiewicz might like to run for mr gejdenson 's old seat in 2002 but ca n't if it 's gone mr ganim has gubernatorial aspirations but would be hurt if his ally mr marcus is deposed mr blumenthal is the presumptive nominee for the next open senate seat but mr lieberman seems intrigued by ms delauro especially because her husband pollster stanley greenberg is a gore lieberman consiglieri a lot of this energy is dammed up behind the logjam of mr lieberman 's complex situation and one thing we know about logjams is that when they break the water and wood start moving very fast election memo colin mcenroe is a radio talk show host in hartford
