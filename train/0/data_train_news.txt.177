 progress can be counted in many ways in the sport of track and field seconds and inches are not the only measuring sticks marcia bailey the coach of the boys track and field team at henrick hudson high school in montrose looked around her school 's sports complex during the county track championships recently and saw other women also coaching male athletes it was n't that way when she took over the hen hud boys team in 1979 i do n't think i ever ran into another woman coach back then she recalled but i did n't really run into any resistance either after all i was teaching in the building and many of the boys i was coaching i also had in my math classes ms bailey who had started with the girls team a few years earlier and then took over both squads had never competed in the sport in high school herself she had never had the chance when i went to westlake high school in thornwood she said it was before the era of girls sports but we did have a good intramural program i did n't get to run on the varsity level until college by the time i graduated in 1974 girls sports were just starting in high schools soon after she began coaching both hen hud squads were track and field powers in league district and even county circles despite competing against larger schools this season the sailors finished second in the league ii b championships in both the boys and girls competitions after winning both titles the year before in our school and our community ms bailey said sports are a very important part of the educational process ms bailey is part of that process she 's really caring said andy rawlins a sophomore sprinter and pole vaulter she 's like that on the track and in the class rawlins had a math class with his coach as a freshman and is in one of her computer classes this term ms bailey has won the respect of colleagues she 's had a few arguments in her time dick mann a high school track and field official at major county meets said but it 's not because she 's a woman she 's always looking out for her kids and she 's very certain of how she wants things done she 's very well organized a very good coach ms bailey said she tailors her coaching to the individual athlete you do n't teach boys differently than girls she said but some kids need a pat on the back and some need a push as with math you have to do problems over and over so that you can master them and the coach will do them right along with her pupils i try to understand the difficulties my athletes have ms bailey said i was a runner and a jumper when i competed and my running was in the shorter distancesi became a distance runner so i could relate more to distance runners i tried the pole vault so i could relate to my pole vaulters currently hen hud has an outstanding hammer thrower in dave americo whose toss of 158 feet 2 inches was 30 feet better than that of the runner up in the county meet so the 5 foot 7 130 pound bailey has been learning more about the event by tossing around the 12 pound hammer the sailors boys team however finished a disappointing sixth overall in the county competition partly because their best all around athlete kevin alford who figured to score in if not win the jumping and hurdling events had been sick all week coach bailey would not let him compete on a raw rainy day alford and americo are two of five hen hud male track stars who are going to continue their sports in college next year and they have been more than competitors in high school my upperclassmen are my assistant coaches said ms bailey who often has not had the luxury of an assistant coach i have a lot of them teaching the underclassmen it has been that way since she was a pioneer 21 years ago society has changed andy rawlins said you get used to having women doing jobs men used to do we 're all on the same planet
