 four weeks ago shortly after ohio state convened for training camp craig krenzel rolled his eyes when he was asked whether it was true that the buckeyes intended to open up their offense this season as they tried to defend their national title krenzel a senior quarterback is a smart guy in fact he is an academic all american majoring in molecular genetics no he explained with a wry smile the buckeyes are a running team and adding more sweeps might be as adventuresome as they would get krenzel is apparently a pretty good poker player too because tonight the no 2 buckeyes walloped no 17 washington 28 9 by throwing over under and around the huskies in a performance that would have been right at home in the huskies own pass happy pacific 10 conference ohio state did it without its suspended star running back maurice clarett by halftime krenzel 's 18 passes were more than he attempted in seven of his games last season as the buckeyes went up by 14 0 his final numbers tonight 15 of 27 for 203 yards were his finest since a 204 yard performance against wisconsin in the eighth game last season while ringing up a 16 1 record as a starter and leading the buckeyes to a nation 's best 15 game winning streak krenzel has eclipsed 200 yards passing on only two other occasions still it was the passes krenzel chose not to throw that were the most meaningful tonight he tucked the ball under his arm and motored his 6 foot 4 225 pound frame around the corners for touchdown runs of 23 and 11 yards this year we have so many more weapons offensively and the key is going to be spreading the ball around krenzel said we 'll only be good if we get different guys the ball ohio state coach jim tressel had indicated early in the preseason that the emphasis on the pass had to do more with krenzel 's intelligence and strong arm than it did with clarett 's absence clarett a sophomore is serving a multigame suspension while the ncaa investigates an exaggerated police report that clarett filed in april after a car he had been loaned was broken into as well as charges that he received unusual academic aid the buckeyes impressive passing game did not exactly have the crowd of 105078 at ohio stadium the third largest in stadium history forgetting woody hayes 's 3 yards and a cloud of dust attack clarett 's replacements the juniors maurice hall and lydell ross combined for 101 yards and each scored a touchdown nor could anyone have forgotten clarett who set a record for ohio state freshmen last season by rushing for 1237 yards and was visible on the sideline in a bright red sweat suit we 've got to get a lot better running the football and we will tressel said this is week 1 i wanted to see us run for 200 and throw for 250 we did neither but we 'll get better but the buckeye faithful had to be heartened by krenzel 's command of a team that returned 18 starters who were seasoned enough to win seven games last season by 7 points or fewer the entire offense is back including the playmaking receivers michael jenkins and drew carter ohio state 's swarming hard hitting defense led end simon fraser 's seven tackles corralled what was supposed to be a high octane washington offense last season washington quarterback cody pickett threw for a pac 10 record 4458 yards and his favorite receiver reggie williams led the conference with 94 catches and 1454 yards but the ohio state defense covered the entire field pickett rarely had time to plant his feet and often launched his throws in desperation he was 26 of 49 for 255 yards while williams battled through an athletic secondary led by cornerback chris gamble and managed to grab 10 catches for 107 yards krenzel 's 23 yard run came with 2 minutes 51 seconds left in the first quarter and gave ohio state a 14 0 lead with 11 seconds left in the half his second touchdown made it 21 0 it was a painful and unforgettable debut for coach keith gilbertson he took over for rick neuheisel as washington 's coach after neuheisel was fired in june for gambling in an ncaa basketball pool and then lying to university officials about it they 're as good as advertised gilbertson said their front four puts on tremendous pressure their defensive backs are everywhere they 're going to win a lot of games while krenzel may have been less than forthcoming last month about ohio state 's passing intentions he was an emphatic that with or without clarett the buckeyes were well equipped to repeat their championship feat in between sessions of leukemia research at the ohio state medical center he led his teammates on voluntary summer drills and liked what he saw he still does it 's going to be a challenge to get better every week krenzel said last year 's team was able to do it i think these guys can
