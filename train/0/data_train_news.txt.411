 when rod thorn the president of the nets emerged from the team 's draft strategy room wednesday night his face was resolute but he seemed drained from the moves he had made as it turned out that was only a preview for yesterday 's blockbuster deal that sent stephon marbury to phoenix for jason kidd they may not have ended up with shooting guard jason richardson who was drafted fifth over all by golden state or kept forward eddie griffin but in the end the nets received something better three versatile talents to fit their needs we went into the draft last night trying to get accomplished exactly what we accomplished and those were the guys we were trying to get thorn said yesterday when thorn traded griffin the nets pick at no 7 to houston for the rights to the rockets three first round picks he then directed houston to select arizona swingman richard jefferson stanford center jason collins and pepperdine guard brandon armstrong the nets lacked a cohesive identity during a dismal injury ravaged 26 56 season the sixth time in seven years they missed the playoffs after selecting brian scalabrine a power forward out of southern california with the 35th pick the nets were left wondering whether they wagered quality for quantity i feel we got more potential quality at a number of positions thorn said i feel good about that we accomplished what we wanted to do everybody was happy with the way things worked out the three for one deal was contingent on the surprise of griffin dropping to no 7 but one eastern conference league executive said that the nets were inclined to make a trade to receive jefferson collins and armstrong anyway we had him going in the top three houston general manager carroll dawson said on their wish list the rockets had griffin ranked first or second but dawson said he never even brought up griffin 's name in predraft discussions with thorn to trade the three picks thinking it was a moot point so did thorn i was a bit surprised yes i thought he would go to golden state thorn said of griffin the warriors instead drafted richardson spoiling the nets hopes and fueling houston 's we had known that they wanted a certain person but if they could not get that person they might be better off with three picks dawson said unable to take richardson and knowing that the grizzlies would select shane battier thorn gambled that houston would be interested working without a deal but knowing from discussions he had leading up to the draft that the rockets were willing to unload their first round picks thorn made his selection in houston dawson picked up the phone do we have something to talk about dawson recalled thorn asking we sure do dawson responded within 10 minutes the rockets had agreed to the trade the teams kept a phone line open so thorn could tell the rockets which players to draft the rockets were not scared off by griffin 's history of fights with teammates stretching from his senior year at roman catholic high school in philadelphia to seton hall in january when griffin was suspended for a game after punching ty shine it did n't bother us i ca n't speak for the other teams dawson said you do your background checks and we got nothing but good reports jefferson 's stock had been rising among league executives based on his strong workouts and his late season performance in the ncaa tournament jefferson a junior led the wildcats to the ncaa championship game shooting 50 percent and averaging 135 points and 67 rebounds he held richardson and illinois point guard frankie williams to a combined 15 points and 5 of 26 shooting there are n't a whole lot of better athletes than richard and this year he became our defensive stopper arizona coach lute olsen said of jefferson on wednesday night thorn said he could see jefferson making an immediate impact playing small forward and shooting guard providing insurance if shooting guard kerry kittles can not fully recover from knee surgery i think he was one of the best athletes in the draft thorn said collins at 7 feet 260 pounds will vie for a starting position at center the nets started the second year player evan eschmeyer in 51 games with jim mcilvaine out for most of the season because of a calf injury the nets did not bring in collins for a workout figuring he would go in the second round although they did bring in his twin jarron jarron collins was selected by the utah jazz with the 53rd pick jason is considered the more polished of the two thorn saw jason at the chicago combine and was impressed with his toughness and his touch he can shoot the ball and he 's a big strong kid who plays very hard thorn said because of two years of medical redshirts jason collins still had two years of eligibility but he graduated from stanford 11 days ago with a degree in economics he had a frayed meniscus cartilage in his freshman year and dislocated his right wrist his sophomore year but he did not miss a game in his last two seasons during this process i did eight workouts in eight straight days flying from city to city never once taking a day off collins said my knee was fine it has n't bothered me all season for the past three seasons in armstrong thorn sees a reserve shooting guard who can eventually learn to play backup point guard as it turns out he will be backing up kidd
