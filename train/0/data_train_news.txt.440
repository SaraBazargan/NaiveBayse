 for the first two innings yesterday at shea stadium arizona 's randy johnson and chad moeller essentially played an uninterrupted game of catch with johnson 's fastball reaching 96 miles an hour and his sliders and splitters hitting 90 the mets flailed away fruitlessly they eventually began to make inconsequential contact which did not stop them from serving as pawns in the latest masterpiece by johnson an imposing left hander going a full nine innings for the fourth time this season johnson struck out 11 batters including the first six he faced and matched his season low by allowing only two base hits his brilliance produced a 2 0 arizona diamondbacks victory and the first four game series sweep of the mets at shea since philadelphia stopped them in june 1995 he 's a power pitcher who knows how to pitch said mo vaughn the only met to make solid contact all afternoon he uses both sides of the plate and he can reach back when he needs to if he does n't make a mistake in an at bat he 's going to get you out the loss went a long way toward squashing the mets postseason hopes losers of their last five games the mets caught a break when philadelphia beat los angeles yesterday 7 5 that kept the mets six and a half game deficit in the national league wild card race from growing now set to begin a six game trip tonight in milwaukee the mets 55 56 are trying to remain optimistic despite falling below 500 for the first time since july 14 it was a tough four game turnaround no doubt about that mets manager bobby valentine said but things can turn around in a favorable way just like that and we can be right where we want to be and making a move again before yesterday 's game the mets believed they could beat johnson they had done so twice in four games against him and his earned run average in two games at shea was 476 he was also coming off a start last wednesday in which he threw 149 pitches to beat montreal but johnson 16 4 made it clear immediately that he was neither weary nor vulnerable the mets put the ball in play in the third inning but no one reached base until johnson walked john valentin in the fifth inning roger cedeno recorded the mets first hit in the sixth on a chopping grounder to third base that he beat out with a headfirst dive into first the next inning vaughn who struck out three times hit a line drive to right concluding the mets offensive output he had a very very good slider today and he was throwing 95 valentine said of johnson but shawn estes was matching him pitch for pitch there and it was whoever scored first estes 4 9 was the one bright spot for the mets throwing well for the fourth straight start he allowed four hits in seven innings he ran into trouble in the sixth when quinton mccracken lined a triple into the gap in left center field craig counsell drove mccracken home for the game 's first run with a hard shot down the first base line that barely eluded vaughn 's grasp matt williams opened the seventh inning by launching an 81 mph changeup over the wall in left center it was williams 's fourth home run in 22 at bats against estes nonetheless estes 's continued improvement was an encouraging sign for the mets in each of his last four starts estes has gone six or more innings and allowed no more than two runs he 's been throwing great mike piazza said he was a little dejected when he came out of the game but i told him that a questionable call over the first base bag and one mistake to matt williams i 'll take that every outing he only gave up two runs you figure that sooner or late we 're going to give him some run support piazza was referring to counsell 's double that scored mccracken but the ball was clearly fair despite johnson 's dominance the mets had a good opportunity to score in the fifth after valentin walked williams threw a grounder hit by joe mcewing into right field while attempting to nail valentin at second base valentin went to third but while attempting to bunt timo perez popped out to moeller johnson then intentionally walked rey ordonez to get to estes who went down swinging he 's tough to hit and tough to bunt too valentine said of perez 's effort i thought it was a heck of a play to try to get a bunt down there but he caught it off the end of the bat if he gets it down we probably score though it was one of his finest outings of the season johnson said he was never comfortable because of the humidity it was a mental and physical grind he said much more so for the mets inside pitch though he has lost his spot in the rotation because of the recent trade for john thomson jeff d'amico will start tomorrow in milwaukee because saturday 's doubleheader has forced the mets to go with a six man rotation roberto alomar strained left groin muscle and edgardo alfonzo strained left rib cage muscle did not play bobby valentine said alomar could be back in a couple of days if he makes as much improvement tomorrow as he did today i think he 'll be real close valentine said alfonzo is further away but he is not a candidate for the disabled list after going 4 for 5 in his first major league start on sunday ty wigginton went 0 for 4 mike piazza admitted that the mets were reaching their wits end i 'm not going to deny the fact that we 're frustrated he said we 've got some guys banged up but we just did n't get it done i do n't know what else to say the mets six and the diamondbacks nine combined to hit 15 home runs during the series tying the shea stadium record for a series of any length
