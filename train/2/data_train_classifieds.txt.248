 the letter was signed a santa beliver and made a simple request give us a good reason to smile in this wonderful season how could julie taylor say no ms taylor was sorting through the letters to santa claus from needy children collected at manhattan 's general post office which for more than 70 years has made them available to the public under the auspices of a program called operation santa claus the tone intrigued her the whole feeling of the letter was so genuine she would later say it was honest and straight from the heart it began my name is ashley i am 6 years old it said she was writing because mom could not and added my brother melvin ca n't talk there was no explanation nor was there a last name this family is very needed the writer went on in prose beyond the years of a 6 year old we would n't have christmas if you do n't reach us ms taylor a matter of fact woman made up her mind folded up the piece of ruled paper and went off to shop and so a letter from a child brought together ms taylor the daughter of missionaries from oregon and the azcona family children of the dominican fields living on public assistance in washington heights briefly during one of the darkest holiday seasons in memory a ray of hold on you might be saying not another dose of christmas treacle all right then thanks to anthrax letters to santa are irradiated these days mailed presents can not just say from the north pole but must have a return address the number of letters is down to an estimated 200000 from 280000 last year fewer volunteers are walking in to take part in operation santa claus though many people are participating by phone and the program 's office has a new computer program to guard against savvy children who send numerous letters to increase their chances more than half are duplicates but none of that crossed ms taylor 's mind a good thing for the azcona children and perhaps for the treacle lovers of the world as a chill gathered on the last day of fall ms taylor drove her creaky 1984 jeep wagoneer uptown and parked on yes st nicholas avenue wearing a red santa hat she walked up a flight of stairs and saw the door of apartment 26a open a sticker declared that inside was ps 115 's student of the month the student as it turns out is ashley hidalgo actually 5 years old her brother is milvio 3 whose name was anglicized in the letter milvio is tumbling about on a worn linoleum floor ashley a girl of large eyes and long lashes sits on a plastic covered couch with her favorite book my silly snowman a moment of panic seizes ms taylor as she enters the one bedroom apartment there are three children instead of two she worries that she misread the letter but she finds out that one of the children is a cousin carlos lopez 5 i 'm not quite santa but close she says to no one in particular as ashley and milvio 's mother francisca azcona and her sister lucila azcona look on puzzled are you ashley i brought you some presents you were asking for ms taylor says to the girl i know a bunch of folks ms taylor continues trying to break the ice you know rudolph ashley and milvio examine the packages this is mine this is my mom 's ashley says reading the labels ms azcona a gentle 28 year old woman does not speak she does not know english and can barely read or write in spanish her native language because she grew up as granddaddy 's girl her family says in a rural area around san jose de las matas in the dominican republic she was never made to go to school so she is taking a basic english class at ps 115 ashley helps her with homework and when ashley needs help ms azcona calls the girl 's father milvio hidalgo who lives elsewhere as the letter said mom ca n't write and milvio can not talk because he has not learned to he suffers from learning disabilities ms azcona is not sure exactly why but she blames the problems on a stressful pregnancy or maybe on the bite on milvio 's head from a rat when he was 2 months old but the boy is making progress he can say words like mommy and tio uncle ms azcona 's nickname lillian comes out giggia she keeps careful track of records of his care signing forms in a shaky print the children 's toys consist mainly of some stuffed animals a toy computer a doll 's bed money is tight ms azcona survives on 290 a month in public assistance 50 a month in child support and 186 in food stamps outside there are drug dealers on the corner this christmas is worse because i have nothing to give ms azcona said in an interview before ms taylor 's unexpected arrival i do n't have the money to buy what they want she begins to cry and turns her face away ms azcona came to new york in 1990 two years after the arrival of another 18 year old ms taylor who came from salem ore to study acting at new york university ms taylor 's father was an independent missionary she lived on indian reservations until age 10 and then on the top floor of a halfway house called chemawa chapel run by her parents for a time in the early 1970 's she her parents and her brother and sister survived on 500 a month in donations one year on christmas eve a sears truck pulled up to the chapel and out came three brand new bicycles from a supporter in canada ms taylor said we never had new bicycles before it comes full cycle ms taylor works as a clown and as a home interior painter times are slow after sept 11 in past holiday seasons companies like cantor fitzgerald and aon risk tenants of the world trade center would hire her clown agency for christmas parties back in the washington heights apartment there is no holding back the children start tearing open the presents a set of hot wheels cars captivates milvio and he makes whoo whoo sounds as he pushes them around ashley struggles to detach a beyond pink barbie doll from its packaging ms azcona takes out a set of winter gloves and a hat ms taylor who bought the gifts in league with her friend allison farrow also gave each child an outfit of clothes and an extra shirt and she brought a large stuffed lion and a stuffed elephant and play doh which starts to squish underfoot lucila azcona puts her hand on ms taylor 's arm her sister says thank you in english shyly then the unexpected happens the doorbell rings it is the postman an anonymous donor has sent a box of toys and clothes also addressed to ashley and melvin no one can figure out how this has happened since ms taylor kept the letter from ashley unfazed ashley tears open the box soon it emerges that ms azcona heard about operation santa claus from a social worker because she can not write she passed on the program address to her sister 's 11 year old daughter tiffany vazquez so that she could send a letter for herself but tiffany possibly in cahoots with ashley wrote on behalf of her cousins instead i hope that god repays you ms azcona tells ms taylor he already has ms taylor says nodding at the children amid the wrapping paper this is my repayment
