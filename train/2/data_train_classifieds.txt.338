 this past week brought the official change from take our daughters to work day to take our children to work day i have lobbied for such a change in this space so i was proud to take evan my 12 year old and alison my writer to be niece to the office with me on thursday the day taught them a lot about how this newspaper works it taught them very little i 'm afraid about what i actually do here there are two reasons for this first i spent much of my time during their visit helping evan and ali and a variety of other children find their way around the building and most of what i do ca n't be learned by watching anyway in fact my kids have watched me for years and what they 've seen is this i sit in front of the computer talk on the phone travel places pull out my hair and pace for a while and then something with my name on it appears in print work is a concept children find hard to understand like sex the closer you get to doing it the more it starts to make sense but until then you have unrealistic views back when i was 5 or 6 i could not figure out what it meant that my father was an orthodontist why would anyone spend his day straightening teeth i wished he had a real job maybe as a normal dentist the kind my friends might actually use by the time i was 11 or 12 of course all my friends bared metal when they smiled and i moved on to wondering what my mother the psychologist did all day lisa earle mcleod 's two daughters do n't understand what their mother does for a living either the author of forget perfect ms mcleod is an inspirational humorist who gives funny speeches about finding joy meaning and satisfaction in the life you 've already got and the you you already are try explaining that to a child her material is about things like digging chips out of the sofa cushions and when her 10 year old tagged along once the girl 's conclusion was this mom i 'm funnier in the lunchroom than you are do you think it 's right to charge people for that some children understand enough about what their parents do to be dangerous alexandra allred 's father worked for the defense intelligence agency but did n't talk about it so when another child told her that both their fathers were spies alex began to brag about it problem was they were living in moscow at the time had he only explained things to me ms allred says now she would have known enough to shut up still explaining does n't always lead to understanding ms allred is a writer and for a book she was writing had to interview a stuntwoman by the name of lisa hoyle ms hoyle described picking up her daughter from kindergarten and being approached by classmates asking to see her stamps it seems that when ms hoyle said she was a stuntwoman her daughter heard it as stamp woman ms hoyle had to take her daughter to a movie shoot so she could see that what mommy did was jump off buildings even showing kids can leave room for confusion another part of ms allred 's research led her to join the united states women 's bobsled team i made sure my kids knew what i did and took them every chance i could to my training she said then came the day she was watching television with her eldest daughter and a bobsledding race came on is that you mommy little kerri asked pointing to the screen after all if mom is a bobsledder then all bobsledders must be mom one of the many parenting lessons i 've learned in short is that kids are inevitably confused by what their parents do a corollary is that once they figure out what we do they will question why we do it with all the interesting things to be in the world billionaire movie star major league pitcher how on earth did we end up in insurance or human resources or sales i recently received a note from jen singer creator of mommasaidcom a web site for stay at home mothers she worried that the popularity of take our children to work day would make it even harder for women whose children are their work she told the story of a friend whose 4 year old son asked what do you do when the friend answered i 'm a mommy the boy replied but i want you to do something odds are that if this mommy did something her 4 year old would suggest she do something else when evan was 4 he noticed that when he went to play at one favorite friend 's house that friend 's mother watched over them but when the boy came to our house our baby sitter was in charge some mommies are the kind who go to the office and other mommies are the kind who stay home i explained why he asked ca n't you be the other kind life 's work this column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week e mail belkin nytimescom correction may 11 2003 sunday the life 's work column on april 27 about take our children to work day misstated the address for a web site for stay at home mothers it is mommasaidnet not mommasaidcom
