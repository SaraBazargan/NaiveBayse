 timing is everything this is true for most sports in which the aim is to be the first to reach the finish line it is particularly true for motor sports where the difference between first place and also ran can be measured in thousandths of a second in the fia formula one world championship a racing series that constantly seeks to push the frontiers of technology no simple timing method will do the system developed over the last decade by the swiss watch company tag heuer includes transponders on every car and racks of computers to provide precise timing data instantaneously to teams race officials and broadcasters it fills 26 trucks as it moves from race to race during the formula one season and three cargo 747 's when it goes overseas to a race like the united states grand prix which takes place this weekend in indianapolis race timekeeping was not always this complicated when the international automobile federation known as fia its initials in french started the modern formula one world championship in 1950 timing was essentially a stopwatch and notepad affair with each team responsible for tracking its own cars a crew member simply stood at the side of the track and recorded the lap and time whenever the car crossed the finish line one early improvement was the timing board which made the crew member 's job a little easier it used three stopwatches one for the previous lap time one tracking the current lap and one reset to zero in preparation for the next it was not until the 1960 's however that a system was developed that allowed one person to time all the cars in a race by simply pressing a button as each one crossed the finish line a team of people was still required however to keep track of the cars a screamer to call out the sequence as the cars crossed the line a writer to record the car numbers and a group of human calculators these were pre pc days who determined average speeds and other race statistics the problem with all of these approaches was that they relied on people if you do the timekeeping manually you have different sources of errors said jean campiche tag heuer 's official timekeeper for formula one the timer could push the button late the cars could be incorrectly identified or a mistake could crop up in the calculations by the 1980 's developments in automated timing eliminated some of the sources of error each car was equipped with a transponder that transmitted a unique signal used to identify the car as it crossed the finish line photocells were used to stop the clock at the exact moment when the cars crossed the finish line by then computers were available for calculations it was less than perfect photocells can not differentiate between two or three cars together and human intervention was often still needed now however people largely stay out of the picture at least while the race is on when tag heuer was named official timer for formula one in 1992 the company concentrated on developing transponder technology the system in use since 1996 is integrated with the track and the data is processed at a timing center accuracy is down to a thousandth of a second transponders mounted low in the chassis near the front suspension are now used to register times as well as identify the cars signals are received by antennas around the track and transmitted to the timing center by fiber optic cable times and speed are measured at the finish line and at two intermediate locations on the track top speed is measured at a fourth location close to the end of the longest straight where the cars are at their fastest antennas are also installed at the pit lane entrance and exit and along the entire stretch dividing it into a series of speed traps if a driver violates the pit lane speed limit of 50 miles per hour at any point a penalty is given previously radar was used but all the drivers knew where it was located and would speed through the pit lane and brake hard just before that point to avoid being caught small cylindrical sensors placed at the starting grid positions used for the first time in 1996 detect changes in the transponder signal at the start if a car moves before the official start race stewards have irrefutable evidence previously stewards had to rely on eyesight to determine false starts the same type of sensor is also used to time pit stops instead of just showing up for race weekend friday to sunday stopwatch and pen in hand the timekeeping staff arrive a week before the race on monday the timing center is assembled sensors installed and the entire system connected by about 25 miles of fiber optic cable wednesday the connections are tested by thursday at 2 pm the pace car transponder is installed and tested the system is expected to work flawlessly for two practice sessions on friday three sessions including the all important qualifying on saturday and a warm up session and race on sunday immediately after the race the crew begins dismantling and packing up in one week they will begin setting up for the next race
