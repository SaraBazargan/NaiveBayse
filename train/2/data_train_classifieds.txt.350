 when israel and the palestinians are simultaneously engaged in a violent conflict and peace negotiations with the potential for their precarious relationship to disintegrate quickly israelis choice of a leader could have far reaching consequences yet 11 days before a possibly fateful election for israeli prime minister the campaign remains lackluster that is even despite a spate of negative campaign advertising this week that should have raised the temperature here but did not right wing voters angry about increased insecurity in israel and fearful about concessions to the palestinians are eager to kick out labor and usher in the likud party leader ariel sharon but they are relatively complacent that is largely because opinion polls show mr sharon far ahead of prime minister ehud barak those published today revealed a continued lead of 16 to 18 percentage points and it is also because mr sharon is a kind of accidental candidate the choice of the nationalist camp only because former prime minister benjamin netanyahu decided to sit out the race a 72 year old military and political veteran mr sharon is not particularly charismatic or telegenic and he is not trying to be what he is n't he is keeping a decidedly low profile his campaign appearances are limited and he is not holding big political rallies or even after being put on the defensive by students this week visiting any more schools on the other side the peace camp is acting depressed as if defeat were a foregone conclusion many centrists and leftists are demoralized by the last four months when the israeli palestinian peacemaking relationship devolved into a primal and blood soaked conflict many are specifically dispirited by mr barak for a variety of reasons some feel that mr barak did not respond forcefully enough to palestinian violence others that he responded too forcefully many think that he took his bedrock constituency for granted by among other things promising civic reforms and then making alliances with ultra orthodox parties only to return to his original promises after the religious parties undermined him and left his government they speak of his zigzags and of his perceived arrogance toward other politicians and toward the public one result is that more than a quarter of israeli voters are undecided or disinclined to vote according to a poll published today and many of these are former barak supporters that includes israeli arabs who are more antipathetic than apathetic in an impassioned column today in the newspaper haaretz yoel marcus urged israeli leftists to realize the importance of the election get over their personal disaffection with mr barak and stop fantasizing about a dream candidate what are you all waiting for he wrote the moment has now arrived for all of you to climb down from your fence to feel solid ground once more under your feet and to accept the fact that this is as good as it gets forget about waiting for another david ben gurion winston churchills and charles de gaulles are not strolling down any israeli street to paraphrase a popular israeli song 'the messiah is not coming and he 's not even going to phone the barak campaign is trying two tactics to lure the undecided and the disenchanted a kind of repentance campaign by mr barak who is apologizing for his errors and a scare campaign that seeks to portray mr sharon as a dangerous figure who could drag the nation into war polls today indicated that the latter message is sinking in and not making much of a difference more than 40 percent of israelis surveyed say they think that mr sharon is likely to hasten the risk of war but mr barak is still drawing only about a third of the voters as he was last week many israelis are steeled for a deterioration in the israeli arab conflict and mr sharon is considered an iron fist the peace talks in taba egypt which continued today and are expected to wrap up early next week possibly by sunday are not helping mr barak politically according to the polls one showed that if the talks resulted in an agreement which is highly unlikely mr sharon would win another 10 percent of the undecided voters on the evening news tonight a senior political commentator bored with reporting mr sharon 's commanding lead had already moved on to speculating about what mr barak would do after he lost the conclusion take a leave from politics and turn over the reins of the labor party to former prime minister shimon peres 77 it is also still not out of the question that mr barak would bow to mr peres before feb 6 and let mr peres run in his place mr barak has until four days before the election to do so under israeli law and speculation about the possibility has hurt him polls show that mr peres would run neck and neck with mr sharon this is the first election in israeli history for the premiership alone and that is one reason that the contest is not generating more noise the many israeli political parties in parliament are not in a battle for their seats but parliament as it stands is riven and it is possible that whoever wins will seek to forge a unity government to stabilize his leadership mr sharon has already expressed his interest in doing this and the prospect serves to weaken voter interest because of the possibility that the two candidates currently butting heads would end up joining forces mr netanyahu assessed that neither he nor anyone else would be able to assemble a stable working majority in this parliament he prefers he said to wait to run until parliament dissolved itself and the entire government moves toward yet another round of elections which he predicted would take place sooner rather than later this situation lowers many israelis expectations that whoever is elected will survive for long and therefore further undercuts their ability to take the current race ultra seriously in some sense people see this election as less important said yaron ezrahi a political scientist because no one thinks they are electing a prime minister who will serve out his term but given the situation of conflict even six months can make a huge difference for history
