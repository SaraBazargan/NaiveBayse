 it 's malignant then give it to me straight doc how long have i got the correct answer to that question a new study suggests may be more optimistic than doc thinks because statistical methods used in calculating cancer survival are too conservative the study says americans with cancer are actually living longer than many doctors have been led to expect and patients researching their disease on the internet may be reading prognoses that are grimmer than the truth a study of 24 million americans in whom cancer was diagnosed from 1978 through 1998 to be published today in the lancet a british medical journal argues that the traditional cohort method used to estimate survival rates does not consider the leaps made in cancer diagnosis and treatment in recent years using a different method called period analysis the epidemiology study concluded that all cancer patients whose tumors are diagnosed today have a 51 percent chance of living 20 years the cohort method would give them only a 40 percent chance the differences vary widely with the types of cancer patients with cancer of the prostate ovary rectum or breast or those with leukemia or hodgkin 's disease probably have much better survival rates than previous figures suggested said the study 's author dr hermann brenner of the german center for research on aging in heidelberg who used the national cancer institute 's database for example dr brenner said a woman with ovarian cancer may have been told that she has a 35 percent chance of surviving 20 years in fact she probably has at least a 50 percent chance of living that long a man with prostate cancer may be told that he has a 44 percent chance of surviving 20 years in fact dr brenner said he probably has an 81 percent chance however dr brenner conceded that some of the most significant improvements in survival come not from miracle cures but from new tests that find tumors including tiny slow growing ones very early for prostate cancer it 's clear that early diagnosis or even over diagnosis may play a role he said but for colorectal cancer leukemia and other cancers he said early detection and better treatment produce genuinely longer lives the current chance of living 20 years after a diagnosis of rectal cancer is about 49 percent not 39 percent his study found and with leukemia 26 percent rather than 21 percent the new analysis included 20 year relative survival rates of 95 percent for thyroid cancer 88 percent for testicular cancer better than 80 percent for melanomas and prostate cancer and 65 percent for breast cancer the study did not analyze which outcomes stemmed from earlier diagnosis and which stemmed from better treatment other biostatistics experts agreed that dr brenner 's analysis probably produces results closer to what a modern prognosis should be in an era when life expectancies are going up even the period method will understate survival probability said dr david a freedman a professor of statistics at the university of california at berkeley to estimate how many patients will live 20 years the simpler cohort method looks at patients whose disease was diagnosed in 1978 and counts how many were still alive in 1998 the flaw in using that method to predict the survival of someone whose cancer was diagnosed in 2002 is that it assumes a 1978 treatment plan with period analysis a statistician would use 1997 data to compute the probability of living one year 1996 data to compute the probability of surviving a second and so on these probabilities can be multiplied together to estimate the probability of surviving 20 years demographers use this method of analysis to compute life expectancy because looking back 80 years to the birth dates of cohorts of aging citizens says little about life expectancy today but dr donald berry head of biostatistics at the m d anderson cancer center in houston cautioned that the study might have little or no effect on what patients hear from their doctors no clinician well almost no clinician dr berry said would simply quote to a patient the overall survival numbers for a type of cancer any good doctor making a prognosis he said takes into account the size of a tumor how far it has spread the patient 's age success rates of new treatments and other factors dr brenner agreed but noted that these survival statistics based on the old numbers are on the internet everywhere and are seen there by patients an advantage of his calculation method dr brenner said is that it is faster at making obvious the impact of new therapies such observations can be useful to policy makers who parcel out dollars to researchers dr brenner used the surveillance epidemiology and end results database of the national cancer institute which has tracked cancers in about 10 percent of the american population for 30 years dr brenda edwards the deputy director of the cancer institute 's database unit said dr brenner 's conclusions were correct adding that we 're going to look at some of the features of his method not all the news from dr brenner 's recalculation was optimistic some cancers that have always had grim prognoses including those of the lungs esophagus liver and pancreas as well as multiple myelomas still have very low 20 year survival rates of 2 percent to 8 percent
