 i was in my second year of college when i dropped out to chase a boy over to europe i hardly knew him the idle rumor that he had once said he liked me provided enough spark to ignite the journey carefully i laid my plans i wrote my parents of my unhappiness with school the lack of challenge my need for a break i scrounged the air fare i found a job waiting tables in a ski hotel outside innsbruck crammed berlitz german then dropped the fellow a casual line where he was studying in vienna i happened to be on the continent i wrote in case he was n't doing much and could use a traveling companion did it work gentle reader i fear it did in her travel writer 's romance my dream of you the irish novelist nuala o'faolain writes right at the end of my mind there was a golden blur this blur was love or hugo or passion no matter what i was thinking or doing talking to a boy in the queue and letting him buy me a cup of coffee reading the wonderfully glamorous place names on the sides of the wagons lit carriages on the platform at calais all the time the center of me was immobile rapt in front of that golden light when i count how many times i have enlisted travel in the service of that light i blush with the shame of a lesson unlearned several lessons in fact for there is traveling to find love traveling to fix love and traveling to feed love and each works on the heart in mysterious ways once i had landed my college quarry we joined forces to trace the castle building adventures of mad king ludwig we roamed up to berlin and back down to munich in a foggy black forest he taught me to whistle the only gift he gave me our sleeping arrangements ran the gamut from separate men 's and women 's hostel quarters to the narrow lobby benches of a sold out hotel in sold out frankfurt to a shared feather bed near mozart 's birthplace in salzburg like victor hugo 's daughter adele who followed an indifferent french officer to the new world i traveled with hope in my luggage every morning i woke believing the bright tulips or the crusty strudel would unlock the door to romance and then i lost him having run low on funds i bid my beloved auf wiedersehen and let him take a solo trip to prague while i earned a few more tips and planned to meet him a week later in amsterdam i knew somehow as the train chugged out of sight that i would never see this wayward boy again and i thought then that the whole trip had been a terrible waste of my time my money my passion if salzburg could n't get a man to fall in love with you i reasoned what could traveling to find love may not always be a doomed prospect my cousin mimi met her husband eurailing and any number of cruises use the possibility of shipboard romance as a chief draw but traveling to fix love surely is before the wedding my first husband and i made a pact that we would see italy together the image of the two of us sipping chianti high in the abruzzi sustained us through those early years when we had to content ourselves with a weekend backpacking expedition or a night out in little italy how happy we would be in florence regarding the david what bliss we would discover in a midnight gondola alas by the time we booked the tickets we were drifting apart we could scarcely agree on a brand of toothpaste much less an itinerary still we arrived at what we thought was a healing arrangement since he had a trust fund he would pay for the trip since i spoke italian i would be guide and interpreter this symbiosis along with the mediterranean sun and ripe olives would reheat our passion but we realized with a growing sense of guilt that the flame had died florence irritated us as if the city 's buoyant nature were to blame for our ennui as we browsed the uffizi our eyes wandered all the beds seemed too narrow the breakfasts too cold he tried hard not to complain about cost i tried harder not to complain about linguistic incompetence in the end we took separate flights home at the edges of these depressing scenes luckily glimmers another sort of romance when i look back on my college escapade i can hardly see the face of the young man toward whom i thought i was traveling what comes to mind instead are the shoulder high banks of snow on the alpine paths the chandeliers at the hotel sacher the heart stopping funicular ride up to garmisch partenkirchen the night before the object of my affection first found me in the village where i was waitressing my boss gave us the night off and the whole staff of the hotel slid downhill to the village polka dance where the postmaster bought me a dark beer and i was spun around the room in a giddy whirl of oompahs and lederhosen likewise my swan song trip to italy afforded me the pleasure of picnicking among sunlit ruins with the peculiar scents of goat cheese and warm stone as a means to get or keep love these journeys were dismal as forays through the world and back to the self they fulfilled their promise after all many travelers women particularly strike up liaisons simply for the companionship of the road who can say that romance even when it fires the blood is not simply a catalyst for seeing the world more intensely for oneself even adele hugo had she regained her presence of mind might have looked past her caddish officer to the sublime highlands of cape breton the swirling colors of barbados which brings me to my final category though trying to wring love out of travel seems a doomed effort traveling when in love can prove nourishing after all you hardly care where you go so long as you go there together time loses meaning a missed train is an opportunity on my second honeymoon we had trouble getting out of the house a friend had lent us in versailles when we finally decamped for mont st michel we both felt the need to shake love 's laziness and get some fresh french air so we rented a pair of squat bicycles the next day we set off along the scenic coast and in what seemed the blink of an eye we reached historic avranches where we ate tartines and cooled off in the town 's sparkling swimming pool then we turned south how we had not noticed that the trip was more than 12 miles each way that it was mostly hilly that the winds blew hard from the west that our bicycle seats were each six inches too low for good pedaling that i had developed a blister or that a storm front was moving in only cupid can say for a time we took refuge in an allied graveyard then soaked and shivering our thighs cramping we hobbled and creaked the final kilometers until my husband 's front tire blew and we walked that night there was plenty of tlc and no room for blame i never want to see avranches again but every time we recall that disastrous bicycle ride one or the other of us gets a hug they coexist uneasily the urge to explore and the urge to entwine but i am not ready altogether to set them apart essay lucy ferriss 's most recent novel is nerves of the heart university
