 att will offer evidence that domestic telephone traffic diverted by mci through canada to avoid tariffs included calls that were placed by the state department and other government agencies a senior executive at att said today the executive said the evidence was to be formally disclosed to government investigators and a bankruptcy court in manhattan on monday the rerouting of domestic government calls through canada or other foreign countries would be problematic because the calls would not be protected from eavesdropping that could compromise national security law enforcement or confidential commercial information industry lawyers said if the rerouting is confirmed it could pose significant new problems for mci 's chapter 11 reorganization proceeding and its business with federal agencies the government is mci 's largest customer and authorities are close to completing a review of whether the company should be barred from winning new government contracts because of its admission that it committed the largest accounting fraud in history the att executive who spoke on condition that he not be identified said the company 's conclusions were based on tests it recently conducted after it received a request for information the request came from federal prosecutors attempting to determine whether mci over nearly a decade defrauded other phone companies by improperly redirecting or laundering telephone traffic to avoid access fee payments to other companies long distance telephone companies are required to make the payments which are among their highest transmission costs the fraud inquiry is based on evidence provided by former mci executives and on technical information supplied by att and two other mci rivals sbc communications and verizon all these sources have told investigators that a scheme to redirect telephone traffic avoided hundreds of millions of dollars and possibly more in fees that mci owed to local telephone companies they have also told investigators that thousands of recent test calls they made through mci lines show that two schemes to avoid the fees are continuing the three rivals of mci have competitive motives to try to derail its chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization which is heading into its final stage next month they have complained that mci 's recent settlement with the government over securities fraud charges was too lenient and they have maintained that the company should be liquidated rather than reorganized but people not associated with the three companies said the justice department was taking the accusations seriously and had opened a fraud investigation that is being supervised by the united states attorney 's office in manhattan brad burns a spokesman for mci issued a statement this evening that did not address the accusation about redirecting government calls but questioned its timing and the motives behind it we have yet to meet with the us attorney 's office so it would be impossible and inappropriate for us to respond to any specifics surrounding their inquiry mr burns said that said we are only one month from our bankruptcy confirmation hearing and expect a final decision on our government contracts in the upcoming weeks you ca n't help but to question the timing and motives of our competitors who are trying to create a difficult environment for us right before our planned emergence from chapter 11 the federal government is near completion of a review to determine whether mci which entered bankruptcy after acknowledging that it had committed accounting fraud should be barred from winning new government contracts as mci 's largest customer the government provides the company with 700 million to 1 billion in business annually the inquiry into the diverted calls could jeopardize that business one method of avoiding the access fee payments which former mci technicians said had been known within the company as project invader or project scorpion involved the use of small telephone companies to make the long distance calls appear as local ones so that the charges would not be levied according to former mci executives they say the other method known as the canadian gateway project involved diverting domestic calls to canada and then back to the united states through att lines so that att would have to pay access fees the senior att executive said att intended to alert federal investigators and the bankruptcy court overseeing mci 's chapter 11 proceeding that it had found evidence of domestic calls redirected through canada from the united states agency for international development the federal deposit insurance corporation the national transportation safety board the pension benefit guaranty corporation the united states postal service the library of congress and other agencies the executive said att technicians had found that domestic calls from the office of at least one member of congress had also been redirected through canada the volume of the diverted telephone traffic is not known the executive said but att also has evidence it will present to the bankruptcy court on monday that a major customer it lost to mci had had its domestic telephone traffic diverted through canada and then onto an att line so that att had to pay the access charges executives at verizon are also said to be planning to take steps to try to put mci 's government contracts in jeopardy a verizon executive said today that the company was planning to send a letter soon to the general services administration which oversees government contracts that will question whether the government should continue to do business with mci the letter will say that if mci passed on any cost savings to the government from avoiding the access charges verizon could have claims against the government the executive said adding that if mci did not pass on the savings the government might itself have been defrauded by mci last week verizon agreed to drop its fight in bankruptcy court to liquidate mci in exchange for a 60 million settlement of its claims the settlement did not preclude verizon from trying steps outside the bankruptcy proceeding that would hinder mci 's reorganization plan
