 when hassan hakmoun played new york last month he needed two gigs one for the traditional music of his homeland morocco and one for all the ideas he has about expanding that tradition since he arrived in the united states 15 years ago he has electrified it joined it with rock and funk bent it toward arabic and indian pop and cooled it down with reggae when i search my brain for music he said i find the rhythm and beats to play other styles of music in my traditional background it 's like my soul if it 's gone i 'm gone mr hakmoun is a master of gnawa music a style of moroccan devotional music performed in all night healing trance ceremonies rooted in west africa it was carried north to morocco via the slave trade centuries ago gnawa music is played on a sintir a long necked three stringed lute and accompanied by castanets it combines call and response african chant wailing arabic melodic lines and a rattling syncopation that is akin to flamenco born in marrakesh to a father who was in the moroccan army and a mother who was a gnawan healer mr hakmoun absorbed the traditional music as a child and by his early teens was playing in jemaa el fna the times square of marrakesh he came to america in 1987 at age 23 for a concert at lincoln center and quickly made a name for himself as a rising force in world music he formed a gnawa rock fusion band zahar signed to peter gabriel 's real world label and began a remarkable series of collaborations with western musicians like the kronos quartet and don cherry using gnawa 's simplicity and vaguely bluesy african roots to meld with rock and jazz what sets hassan apart from most other moroccan musicians is his willingness to come to the western and arab musicians and try to adapt his playing to them said philip schuyler a professor of ethnomusicology at the university of washington whose area of expertise is north africa and the middle east with people like randy weston and pharoah sanders the gnawa are just being used as a kind of base on which other musicians can do their thing now 38 mr hakmoun has just released his first album in nine years the gift triloka which stretches the moroccan sound further than anything he had done before incorporating arabic music and even sugary american pop the first song on the album syada ana is a sprightly funky hymn to a saint that is based on a traditional melody but played with electric guitar and a bouncy bass line similar to the trance funk he first attempted a decade ago with zahar but lighter in june mr hakmoun married paula cole the american pop singer whom he met while on tour with mr gabriel in 1994 the couple set up a studio at their home in bel air calif and recorded a straight pop duet this gift with top dollar los angeles studio musicians it 's a sweet song with this gift i 'll keep surviving they sing in harmony about love or music but without much connection to moroccan music it 's the least effective track on the album this gift is not the only crossover pop track on the album there 's also layla layla a saudi hit from the 70 's that aims to strike a nostalgic chord with fans of arabic pop it 's played with big swells of arabic strings and punctuated by electronic zaps and mr hakmoun sings it like a true vamp other tracks like lala aisha and hamu achieve a spellbinding fusion of moroccan and arabic sounds as mr hakmoun 's sintir duels with arabic violins and clanging moroccan castanets push the mix into passionate crescendos crossover can be a dirty word but not for mr hakmoun the big idea is to get people to listen to us he said in a recent interview at a quiet moroccan restaurant in the west village quiet because the restaurant 's owner an old friend of mr hakmoun 's from morocco closed the place down for lunch i use keyboards drums guitar to introduce people to what we do with traditional instruments and pop is nothing new for him stevie wonder miles davis bob marley these are the kind of people that i listened to in morocco he said the european musicians that i listened to were the police the beatles pink floyd led zeppelin michael jackson he says was my hero he was only four or five years older than me and i saw the opportunities he had with his family mr hakmoun added i grew up with the same kind of family in morocco and that showed me that there is opportunity in america as an artist another of mr hakmoun 's current projects makes an even more ambitious cultural connection on a trip to brazil in the spring of 2000 he found himself jamming with some of the players from olodum the famous samba group from salvador da bahia once they began playing all the musicians were struck by the rhythmic similarities between samba and moroccan music they were freaking out when they heard gnawa music he said of the brazilians and to me the brazilian style sounds like african music it was like uniting a family with music he gathered some moroccan musicians and recorded a number of songs with olodum in two sessions in salvador and sao paulo he plans to do some electronic tweaking on the tapes and release an album in 2004 next on the agenda is a trip to west africa to explore the source of gnawa music i know that 's where my roots came from originally he said in mali and senegal and all over west africa they play the same kind of music i play it 's like searching for a lost family i want to find my origin
