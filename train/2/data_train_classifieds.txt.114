 komarin leo beloved husband of franci loving father of gary and the late peter beloved brother of the late paula trost and regina salzberg loving father inlaw of sharon adoring grandfather of jenna zoe and wyatt i read of a man who stood to speak at the funeral of his friend he referred to the dates on his tombstone from the beginningto the end he noted that first came the date of his birth and spoke of the second with tears but he said that what mattered most of all was the dash between those years for that dash represents all the time that he spent alive on earth and now only those who loved him know what that little line is worth for it matters not how much we own the cars the house the cash what matters is how we live and love when we 're living out the dash if we could just slow down enough to consider what 's true and what is real and always try to understand the way other people feel andbe less quick to anger and show appreciation more and love the people in our lives like we 've never loved before if we treat each other with respect and more often wear a smile remember that this special dash might only last a while so when your eulogy is being read with your life 's actions to rehashwill you be pleased with what there 's to say about how you spent your dash marlene feldman niece
