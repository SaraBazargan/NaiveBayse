 with mayor michael r bloomberg still struggling to win control of the public school system the board of education announced yesterday that it planned to vote next week on schools chancellor harold o levy 's contract ninfa segarra the board president said she hoped that mr bloomberg would let her know by thursday the day of the scheduled vote whether he wants mr levy to stay and for how long she scheduled the vote for thursday may 30 she said because the board is required to decide mr levy 's fate by june 1 if they do not act by then his contract will automatically be extended for a year earlier this week mr bloomberg told reporters that he and mr levy would discuss the chancellor 's contract before june 1 and presumably decide how long he should stay past june 30 when the contract expires but the mayor is still focused on his negotiations to win control of the school system and has said he hopes to strike a deal with the state legislature before he makes any other education related decision we are urging city hall to make clear to us what they would like us to do because we consider ourselves partners with the mayor ms segarra said yesterday at the same time i have seven members who have a fiduciary responsibility to meet this obligation of doing something about the contract ms segarra said that six of the seven board members including herself did not want to renew mr levy 's contract because they felt he had not improved the school system during his two years on the job but she added if the mayor told us to renew the contract we would ms segarra said that she told city hall about the vote before scheduling it through a spokesman mr bloomberg declined to comment yesterday as did mr levy june 1 is also the date by which the mayor and the five borough presidents are supposed to appoint new members to the board of education but deputy mayor dennis m walcott said earlier this week that city hall had sought a legal opinion on the issue and decided that the appointments could be delayed if the mayor had not won control of the system by then in fact mr bloomberg appears eager to close a deal in the next week so that he can make decisions about the chancellorship without going through the board under a plan that both houses of the legislature have agreed to he would appoint 8 members of a new 13 member board of education one of his members would be the chancellor who would report directly to him mr bloomberg wants the reconfigured board to have almost no say over policy although a bill that he helped write and the republican controlled state senate has introduced would allow the board to vote on any school privatization or voucher program but sheldon silver the democratic speaker of the assembly is resisting parts of mr bloomberg 's proposal he is pushing for the new board to have a say in budgetary and policy decisions he also insisted that mr bloomberg promise not to reduce the city 's spending on its public schools from one year to the next the final sticking point is over the 32 community school boards which mr bloomberg originally said should be abolished immediately and replaced with a system that assured more parental involvement now he has agreed to delay getting rid of them until public hearings can be held but in the meantime he wants to sharply reduce the boards role in hiring superintendents mr silver is balking saying such a move would strip the local elected boards and the communities they represent of their last remaining power to shape their schools mr silver also maintains that the justice department would have to approve any change in the powers of community school boards since manhattan the bronx and brooklyn fall under the federal voting rights act the two men talked again yesterday in a meeting they both characterized as productive but said they did not resolve the outstanding issues assemblyman steven sanders chairman of the assembly education committee said the meeting was primarily a chance for mr bloomberg and mr silver to mend fences after negotiations broke down earlier in the week the purpose of this conversation was to try to get their discussions back on track mr sanders said and to make one last effort to see if we can arrive at a consensus over the next few days or weeks the two sides will talk again today and mr bloomberg 's aides will hold a collective bargaining session with the city teachers union which has gone 18 months without a contract and has threatened to strike in september
