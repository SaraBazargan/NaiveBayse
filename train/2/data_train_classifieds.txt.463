 a few weeks ago i went shopping for a 32 inch television set i visited a couple of local electronics superstores read consumer reports talked to friends and i searched the internet where i found just the highly rated feature laden model i wanted for 750 shipping included no tax the salesman at circuit city was willing to match the price but with the sales tax it would still cost me more so i bought the tv set from an e commerce site called 800com it arrived recently and works perfectly this was a great deal for me and by making it i participated in a grand experiment that is helping to hold down inflation while sustaining the booming economy too bad it ca n't last let me explain there are several big reasons why the american economy has managed in recent years to defy the rule of thumb that strong growth and low unemployment inevitably lead the general level of prices up an accelerating escalator perhaps the most crucial factor lately has been fierce competition from internet shopping sites willing to sell goods at a loss in order to lure customers from traditional retailers while comparatively few people actually buy much yet online the cut rate prices widely available in the virtual economy have forced many companies operating in the bricks and mortar world to respond by keeping their prices low too as sung won sohn chief economist at wells fargo bank in minneapolis recently noted in just one example among many many people check toy prices on the internet and ask toy stores to match them or they see the merchandise at a store and go home and buy it for less on the internet this is heaven for consumers while the general price level for all goods and services has been rising for the last few years at what is still a very modest 2 percent or so prices in many of the most competitive arenas are actually down the price index for toys as calculated by the bureau of labor statistics has been falling since 1995 books on average cost less today than in 1997 prices for audio and video equipment which just joined the e commerce rush dipped last year by 038 percent but it is hell for retailers despite the benefit of a sales tax exemption e commerce companies selling everything from harry potter and pokemon to dvd players and the saving private ryan disks to watch on them all at big discounts are losing tons of money some say they are inherently more efficient and it is just a matter of time before they turn a profit others like buycom argue that they do n't need to make money on products they sell to consumers because they expect to make plenty selling ad space on their sites either way merchants on the web do n't really care as long as investors remain willing to bid up their stock making it easy to raise even more cash to cover their losses this situation is bound to come to an end it wo n't happen immediately but even internet companies can not continue to lose money indefinitely there 's going to be a shakeout said jose a rasco an economist at hoenig company in rye brook ny who wrote a short report last week on what he calls digital deflation i 'm not a big believer in the model that says you can sell at a loss but make it up on volume mr rasco added and ad spending wo n't hold up in a downturn so when the consolidation takes place and it will suppliers will regain some pricing leverage over consumers none of this diminishes the extraordinary economic benefits to be derived from the commercialization of the internet even after many of the web sites that can not generate a profit disappear the internet will remain a powerful tool for bringing together potential buyers and sellers from anywhere in the world the web will continue to empower consumers by giving them a lot more information to use in bargaining for the best price cars for example are not sold online but sites like autobytel wwwautobytelcom and carpoint wwwcarpointcom allow buyers to solicit bids from a number of dealers from the haven of their own desks and there is now a wealth of once secret wholesale price information available online i remember when the edmunds blue book was practically the holy grail mr rasco said now you can get it everywhere online for free this free for all has forced every supplier that wants to survive to become more efficient enhancing economic growth in myriad ways and consumers taking advantage of their savings have more money left to spend freely on all kinds of things but the current arrangement in which many web shopping sites are practically giving away their products is too good to last enjoy it while you can
