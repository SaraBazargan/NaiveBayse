 for those who pay attention to such things there is change afoot at the indian point nuclear plants correction make that the indian point energy center in the process of taking over the plants the entergy corporation has been replacing the nuclear part of the name with the more generic some might say more innocuous energy center a sign with the new title went up last fall outside the main entrance of the plants which are in buchanan about 35 miles north of midtown manhattan and in the past month the name has surfaced in a series of newspaper and radio advertisements intended to reassure the public about the safety of indian point 's nuclear operations in one recent newspaper ad for instance readers were urged to take confidence in the security of indian point energy center jim steets a spokesman for entergy said the name change reflected the company 's plan to eventually add a gas turbine to the site and to integrate what had been two separate nuclear plant operations under different owners entergy bought indian point 3 from the new york power authority in 2000 and indian point 2 from consolidated edison in september it was an important message to our employees that we were one site one team he said it was really about the integration of the sites rather than coming up with a name that was more palatable but some critics say that entergy is trying to downplay its nuclear operations in reaction to widespread concerns over safety since the sept 11 terror attacks corporations like to find ways to explain to people that castor oil is really honey said state assemblyman richard l brodsky this is the kind of thing that general electric tried to do with pcb 's in the hudson mr steets has denied any such motive calling the criticisms naive and overly suspicious indian point only means one thing to anyone who 's been involved or lived in westchester he said it was n't like we were trying to fool them into thinking we were a solar generated plant indian point is not the only nuclear plant seeking a makeover the millstone nuclear power station in waterford conn recently shortened its name to millstone power station while washington nuclear project 2 near richland wash was rechristened the columbia generating station among the other plants without a nuclear in sight is the susquehanna steam electric station near berwick pa it 's not unusual not to have nuclear in the name said diane screnci a spokeswoman for the federal nuclear regulatory commission but in the commission 's records at least the official name of the indian point plants remains the indian point nuclear generating unit 2 and unit 3 in the end of course a name change is just that a nuclear plant by any other name is still a nuclear plant harry di pietro 65 a storeowner in buchanan who supports nuclear energy said he would continue to call it just indian point i know what it is whatever they call it he said it does n't really matter what 's in a name anyway
