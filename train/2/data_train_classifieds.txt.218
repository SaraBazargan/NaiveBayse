 amid the current carnage in technology shares nuance communications is one of the last great story stocks nuance a leading developer of advanced speech recognition software able to recognize and respond to human voices is tapping into a market that many technology analysts say they believe is potentially enormous big companies which spend tens of billions of dollars annually on call centers to take orders and provide customer support increasingly rely on speech recognition not just to handle requests for information but to process customer orders at fidelity investments the boston mutual fund giant almost 5 percent of its customers now use computerized voice recognition for trades and the company expects that fraction to climb said jim taylor fidelity 's senior vice president for retail phone operations automated call centers are only the most obvious way speech recognition will be used the software is now becoming sophisticated enough to identify speakers through voiceprints akin to fingerprints eventually reducing the need for personal identification numbers within a few years many analysts say the standard telephone dial tone will be replaced by internet enabled telecommunications systems that understand human voices and can connect to both other phones and web sites ultimately you can imagine a day when you pick up the phone and instead of hearing a dial tone you hear 'how can i help you said graham smith nuance 's chief financial officer we obviously think the market is pretty huge until a couple of weeks ago investors seemed to agree between april when nuance based in menlo park calif first sold shares to the public and early november the company 's shares rose almost seven fold that gain gave nuance which has lost about 18 million so far this year a market valuation of almost 4 billion about 100 times its trailing annual sales even by the loose standards of last winter that ratio was extraordinarily high now nuance is suffering its own mini crash as investors once again learn that great stories do not always make great companies or great stocks since nov 8 nuance shares have dropped from 11581 to 3225 a withering 72 percent plunge any highflier has just gotten knocked down and they were definitely a highflier said brian ruttenbur an analyst at morgan keegan a regional securities firm based in memphis last wednesday when nuance 's stock stood at 54 mr ruttenbur decided that the company 's shares had bottomed and become a bargain he raised his rating from market perform to outperform i thought it was settling out he said instead i became a javelin catcher nuance may not be through spearing unwary investors according to short sellers who think the company remains overvalued despite its steep decline short sellers sell stock they have borrowed hoping to buy it back later when its price has fallen the shorts argue that the market for speech recognition software is likely to develop more slowly than nuance 's boosters hope they point to a report earlier this year from frost sullivan which predicts that the overall speech software market will be only 700 million in 2006 up from about 100 million last year in addition they note that nuance 's domestic sales dropped from the second quarter to the third quarter though its overall sales rose about 20 percent to 144 million more important when the market does mature the skeptics argue nuance will get only a tiny fraction of it because its software is a commodity that is the least valuable part of the recognition business the hardware provided by companies like ibm and nortel networks and the application software that guides customers through a menu of choices are far more important they say there is a serious discrepancy in the marketplace said manuel asensio who has sold nuance shares short it 's one of those triple digit multibillion wonders that when it gets to be under 500 million people will go 'gee who would have thunk mr asensio also complained that in september only five months after the company 's initial public offering nuance executives sold more than 17 million shares of stock which at the time were valued at more than 210 million executives will be able to sell another 19 million shares of stock in december when a lockup expires nortel which uses nuance 's software in the call centers it sets up for corporations and is nuance 's largest customer plays down nuance 's role in its products it 's three  or four layer cake here and they 're down in the infrastructure said marty dixon who directs customer interaction solutions for nortel which accounted for 29 percent of nuance 's sales in the first six months of 2000 ken holl senior product manager for advanced speech technology for nortel said nuance 's product was not very different from similar speech engines offered by royal philips electronics the giant dutch high technology conglomerate or speechworks a boston based competitor we have a very strong relationship with nuance but we also have a strong relationship with philips mr holl said they both support a good set of features the core technology all originated from the same source mr smith the nuance chief financial officer said that analysis was simplistic nuance 's software offers advantages over its competitors including better recognition over background noise like traffic he said in addition nuance 's software is able to simultaneously process thousands of conversations on a single network he said that scalability will be crucial for companies like sprint pcs as they replace dial tones with speech software ultimately scalablility becomes very important mr smith said after raising money from public investors twice in the last seven months nuance has enough cash to ride out a prolonged downturn that money gives it time to prove the value of its software but even after its three week skid nuance has a 1 billion market capitalization and trades at 25 times trailing revenues that valuation gives it plenty of room to drop correction december 8 2000 friday the market place column in business day on nov 29 about nuance communications a developer of speech recognition software referred incorrectly to the sale of 17 million shares by stockholders in september nuance executives sold 122000 shares and other stockholders including venture capitalists and members of nuance 's board sold the rest nuance executives did not sell the entire amount
