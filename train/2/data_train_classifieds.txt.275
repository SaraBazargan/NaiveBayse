 q our building manager recently sent our board a roundup of the myriad signs that must be posted in our six story co op our intimate building which has done fine for 75 years without these notices is beginning to resemble a hotel with all this signage is there no distinction between a 24 unit building and a large apartment building regarding these signs susan j trammell manhattan a james g samson a manhattan real estate lawyer said that under current federal state and new york city law as many as 32 different signs may have to be posted in residential multiple dwellings in the city new york city alone requires as many as 20 different signs mr samson said explaining that different regulations require different signs to be posted at different locations some are near the front door some are in the lobby some are near the mailboxes and some are in the hallways and landings he said in fact he said a recent signage requirement imposed by the city makes landlords responsible for ensuring that a fire emergency instruction placard is affixed on the inside entrance door of every apartment in a multiple dwelling he said the reason the managing agent is making the board aware of the requirements is probably because a building owner or a co op or condominium association can be fined for failing to post a required sign penalties can range anywhere from 10 for failure to post the janitor 's residence sign to several thousand dollars a day for failure to display a petroleum bulk storage registration certificate near the heating oil tank he said adding that the city 's administrative code does not provide a way for smaller multiple dwellings to get a waiver or exemption and since approaching state and federal agencies for an exemption will likely be time consuming and probably futile he said compliance is usually a lot easier landlord billing for uncollected rent q i live in a 60 unit apartment house and am a rent stabilized tenant several years ago several tenants filed a rent reduction claim against our landlord because there were several violations in the building after many hearings and appeals the division of housing and community renewal ultimately reduced our rent since that time the landlord has accepted my reduced rent checks and renewed my lease however he has continued to bill me for what the rent would have been if there had n't been a reduction he now shows a past due rent of over 13000 my question is when i die is my estate responsible for this back rent sylvia abrams brooklyn a lucas a ferrara a manhattan lawyer who is an editor of the landlord tenant practice reporter a newsletter for lawyers said that based on the information provided the landlord would not be able to collect the so called past due rent mr ferrara said that when a landlord fails to provide essential or required services to a rent regulated tenant the state division of housing and community renewal has the power to issue an order reducing the tenant 's rent after the order is issued he said the landlord can not collect future rent increases until the agency restores the rent and any allowable increases since the landlord has renewed the lease while continuing to accept the letter writer 's reduced rent payments he said it is unlikely that the agency has issued an order restoring the original rent and increases 'it appears the tenant is being billed for the rent differential as if no reduction order has been in place he said and if that 's the case those moneys are not recoverable either from the tenant or her estate even if the state agency restores the previous rent he said it is not retroactive and the amount the landlord considers past due is not recoverable
