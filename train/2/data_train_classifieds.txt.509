 when my pager sounded last october i had enough time to grab an overnight bag and run we had just been deployed to yemen in the aftermath of the uss cole bombing as we climbed aboard a massive c 5 military transport plane i left a message on our answering machine this might take a couple weeks i told my wife watch the news and tell the kids i love them i have never been very good at goodbyes when you work for the fbi 's critical incident response group missions spring up out of life with little or no warning like the waco siege which started with a call outside dirty charlie 's burger joint and ended eight weeks later sorry about jake 's hockey game you say racing to the airport i 'll make it up to him when i get back broken promises tend to rub on you after the adrenaline subsides especially on nights alone with nothing to think of but regrets my family had been through this before during a trip to kosovo in 1999 65 of us had to share one satellite phone in the middle of a rye field calling home meant waking up in the night standing under the stars and pretending that no one could hear you or that foreign intelligence services were n't listening in leaky plumbing and the chicken pox take on a whole new meaning when someone named fawas is taking notes in the first two weeks our investigation in yemen had gone smoothly our joint operations command post was at the aden hotel i had just checked in for the night when a fellow agent handed me a note that changed everything it read in part intelligence sources have discovered an immediate and credible threat to personnel in the aden hotel in the cryptic lexicon of the intelligence community immediate and credible means they 're coming for you now everyone in the middle east from schoolchildren to osama bin laden knew where we were staying if a suicide bomber wanted to drive a truckload of explosives right up to the concierge desk there was n't a thing we could do about it are you going to get it over quick in the lobby one of my colleagues asked or ride the building down i laughed at his macabre humor then started writing to my wife rosie if you get this note i stopped if you get this note i had n't even said goodbye the kitchen faucet still leaked my guitar needed new strings strange things run through your mind when you believe you 're about to die to hell with operational security i thought we had two satellite phones down the hall the fbi could n't discipline me if i was dead i punched in an access code and dialed home hello my wife said when she answered hi rosie i said how are you baby she asked it 's hot over here but i 'm ok how are the kids they 're fine she paused at the echo when are you coming home not for a while i answered seventeen sailors died on the cole in a firestorm of fuel and steel the bomb headed our way would n't be kinder i was n't coming home none of us were i just wanted to hear your voice i said trying to sound cheerful i did n't want her to remember my last words as a lie i love you occurred to me after she had hung up but maybe it was best that i never said it my voice would have broken and she would have wondered why it was the same conversation we had stumbled through so many times before just a handful of words had to hold us for months it was after 1 am when i hung up i lay down on my bed holding my gun wondering whether my family would hear about the bomb on cnn or if someone would call first it felt strange not being able to fight back but there was no one to fight it 's the dread of terrorism that wears you down i had survived threats like this before maybe a part of me did n't really think it could happen sometime near dawn i fell asleep a few hours later i awoke to the sounds of muslims praying my first thought was n't gratitude but surprise we never found out why the bombers never came i explained the call three weeks later as i caught up on report cards and soccer scores my wife seldom asked about missions but this time i wanted her to understand i 'm glad you did n't tell me she said when i finished i do n't know how i would have gotten through the night there was no sadness in her voice just relief she had her ways of coping too i nodded my head as i held her there would be another mission tomorrow or the next day maybe that 's why i 'm no good at goodbyes they remind you of how much you have to leave behind lives christopher whitcomb has been an fbi agent for 15 years he is the author of cold zero inside the fbi hostage rescue team to be published by little brown this month
