 this fireplace heats the whole house slim aarons said pointing to the ravenous fire warming his book lined living room on a frigid afternoon earlier this month mr aarons 85 the photographer whose images of the beau monde at leisure appeared in town country and life magazine for nearly half a century was extolling the design of his 1782 clapboard farmhouse where he has lived since 1953 the farmers were so smart he said referring to the original owners they planted black walnut trees in front because their leaves were the first to shed in the fall so the house gets the warm winter sunlight when it needs it for mr aarons adroit planning is crucial i 'm a great believer in form and design he said that guiding principle is apparent in his kitchen where a drawer next to the oven is impeccably organized with every conceivable implement for baking similarly the stairway to the cellar is lined with virtually every household necessity including various types of glue all tacked to the wall that organizational zeal is also evident in mr aarons 's photos of swells once he dragged away a giant freezer blocking a 15th century mural that made a splendid setting for a portrait of a roman princess frank zachary the former editor of town country and mr aarons 's former boss called him the photo laureate of the upper classes after a stint as an army photographer mr aarons was sent around the world by diana vreeland the fashion editor of harper 's bazaar once upon a time is a somewhat tardy follow up to mr aarons 's first book a wonderful time harper row 1974 which is similarly

ordinary guy mr aarons said i just picked a niche nobody else did luckily it was a world that everyone wanted to read about the society beauties mr aarons photographed were gossip column celebrities of their day every woman in america wanted to be babe paley c z guest or gloria guinness he said those glory days have passed and mr aarons has bid adieu to the city he said he now preferred living in the country and rarely ventured into manhattan only an hour away i do n't go to new york anymore he said i went when it was great and beautiful he was referring in part to the 1950 's when he paid 32 a month for a one bedroom apartment with a terrace on 57th street near park avenue mr aarons 's society portraits include the now familiar image of mrs guest blond and icily beautiful as she holds the arm of her 5 year old son alexander they are standing at her mother in law 's palm beach estate where a fanciful temple to the goddess diana stands sentinel between pool and ocean that image adorns the cover of mr aarons 's new book once upon a time to be published next month by abrams which has become an inadvertent memorial to mrs guest who died on nov 8 in katonah mr aarons who claims to abhor personal publicity was ready to roll an interview with him is not for the fainthearted nor the hungry i arrived for lunch at 12 30 and there was no sign nor mention of food until 4 30 when a lunch of locally smoked salmon was served at last mr aarons likes to talk after a marathon six hour soliloquy during which he scarcely stopped for a breath i was a nervous wreck but mr aarons was just getting started do n't you want to see the rest of the house he asked wearing a light blue shirt open to reveal an old fashioned blue and white polka dot ascot and chinos long enough to accommodate his prodigiously long legs he is 6 feet 4 inches mr aarons led me upstairs to his workroom there surrounded by old fashioned projectors were boxes of negatives labeled arizona millionaires hugh hefner chicago playboy club and bahamas and s america images that might end up in another volume of photographs in the living room where a pair of gleaming english hunting horns stood ready to be sounded mr aarons showed off his books i have every single thing mark twain ever wrote he said no fancy words he added admiringly every trip i traveled i always carried mark twain with me the greatest read in the world i read 'tom sawyer every year the house contains an eccentric assemblage of trophies and memorabilia in a dark hallway mr aarons pointed a flashlight at a wooden weather vane desmond guinness gave me this he said referring to the scion of the irish brewery fortune it used to hang on his door at college the inscription in bold letters said it 's a lovely day for guinness another tour revealed a mural depicting mr aarons farmhouse and the countryside around it i got tired of putting up wallpaper he said mr aarons said he liked living in katonah near bedford all the movie stars have moved in he said chuckling ralph lauren lives just across the lake from here bob pittman lives right here on the corner and the grandson of commodore vanderbilt lives just over there he said pointing to a nearby field last weekend mr aarons attended the funeral of c z guest an event that inspired many of the congregants to remark afterward that her passing signaled the end of an era of grace and style embodying that nearly extinct era mr aarons was something of a star at the luncheon that followed at templeton the guest estate in old westbury on long island everywhere he turned mr aarons was in demand john olsen a senior marketing executive at tommy hilfiger came up to pay homage we have copies of your first book around the office and we refer to it all the time he said no matter your background or your walk of life or circumstance he continued mr aarons 's pictures evoked a simpler time when everyone looked very happy and obviously very rich too he added mr aarons had spent two hours standing on his feet reminiscing about mrs guest suddenly he looked dizzy and on the verge of losing his balance he accepted an offer to accompany him to his car where a driver awaited him in the doorway he fainted and collapsed in my arms when the cry went out for a seat for mr aarons jane holzer the former warhol superstar obliged by fetching a leopard skin armchair i 'm 85 he declared ca n't stand up that long after regaining his composure mr aarons climbed into a waiting car for a good snooze he was driven home and two days later he was eager to talk some more about his book
