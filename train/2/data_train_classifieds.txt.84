 in a letter accompanying the budget plan he released last month gov george e pataki upheld the importance of jobs and vowed his proposal preserves promised tax cuts and avoids job killing tax increases so that businesses will stay in new york and flourish but after reading the fine print some lobbyists lawmakers and labor and business leaders said they have found a contradiction the budget is less business friendly than it may first appear while the governor has avoided calling for across the board corporate or income tax increases he does propose 14 billion in new fees and surcharges that would hit the insurance and health care industries hard and affect other businesses like tire sales and nuclear power advocates for those industries and some lawmakers said it would raise the cost of doing business here perhaps resulting in job loss or even the flight of businesses from the state the complaints are part of the negotiation process that goes on after a governor 's budget is introduced and the legislature is about to put its stamp on the annual spending plan but the fees are the biggest boost of new revenue in a budget proposed to close a cumulative 115 billion gap a large chunk or about 400 million worth are levied on the insurance industry with the governor proposing among other things a 52 million to 117 million increase in surcharges on policies for auto insurers a 35 million increase in assessments on state insurers to pay for an increase in the state 's insurance department budget and millions more in increases on the surcharges that health plans must pay despite his facile rhetoric condemning job killing taxes the governor 's budget adds over 400 million in taxes assessments fees and mandates on insurers of all types said assemblyman alexander b grannis a democrat from manhattan who is the insurance committee chairman as sure as night follows day insurers will pass these new costs on to consumers mr pataki 's proposed menu of surcharges also includes a 400000 increase in the annual fee paid by nuclear plant operators that is estimated to raise 24 million for the state another proposal would add a 225 fee for every new tire sold raising 45 million as for the health care industry the budget not only cuts medicaid which reimburses providers of medical services for the poor it also temporarily reinstates charges on hospital revenues to raise 1922 million and on home care services to raise 17 million each would be reduced by 25 percent annually and phased out by 2007 according to the plan i am not going to say to you that it is the budget i would have crafted said mark p alesse director of the state chapter of the national federation of independent business which represents 13 million small businesses in new york if i had drafted it it would have cut spending more dramatically and i would not have included anything that would have increased the cost of insurance in proposing a 908 billion spending plan that slightly shrinks the size of state government the governor has pledged to fight against efforts to tax our way back to fiscal health in a series of speeches made in the week before the budget was released last month he repeatedly said that raising taxes to balance the state 's books would cause businesses to flee new york in fact he vowed to cut taxes further to attract businesses the governor 's goal said past and current advisers is to create a fiscal climate in new york that allows business to flourish thus pulling the state from the economic doldrums that created the budget gap the actions mr pataki is proposing for the next fiscal year which begins april 1 will enable the state to spend on programs later the advisers said further they said the governor 's budget includes a sweetener for the insurance companies even as it seeks more money from them the governor has offered an additional 125 million in tax credits for insurance companies that provide funding for new small companies in the tech and biotech fields officials said but officials in the health care and insurance industries say they are the economic engines of the state accounting for some one million jobs in the state 's work tforce of eight million according to the latest statistics available from the state 's labor department driving up their costs will further depress the economy by forcing them to lay off workers and pass costs on to consumers they argue for the health care industry the combined impact of increased fees and 500 million in medicaid cuts would have a devastating economic impact industry representatives said it is safe to say that these cuts would close hospitals said kenneth e raske the president of the greater new york hospital association craig m burridge the executive director of the pharmacists society of the state of new york said that the budget cuts would cause 1500 independent pharmacies to close and prompt the loss of 12600 jobs in the field mostly in new york city an analysis by aides to assembly speaker sheldon silver found that the cuts to medicaid would lead to the loss of 38000 jobs overall in health care the budget is not business friendly in the context of the health care industry which is the largest industry in the state in terms of jobs mr raske said i think that the governor is totally sincere in his mind about the need to grow jobs he said but he added the government funding formulas for health care are so complicated that the impact of mr pataki 's budget proposals is more severe some in the insurance industry are withholding their criticism hoping to negotiate a deal with the governor and legislature to spare the industry hundreds of millions of dollars in new fees still thomas e workman the president of the life insurance council of new york a nonprofit trade association said he was perplexed by the budget we really do believe it was not thought through to fully understand how it would impact us especially the companies based here in new york he said some of our larger members are household words or household names he said they are gems for this state and we want to foster their success we want to encourage their success not unintentionally impair their success he added i have tried not to say that we are going to pick up our marbles and go away that is not what you say when you are looking for relief or some more reasonable proposal
