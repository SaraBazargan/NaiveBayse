 at the start of this tale five years ago a connecticut priest is wandering in siena a walled city in tuscany a mix up occurs coincidence or is it divine providence fills the middle of the story by the end on july 2 the priest and his now triumphant tale will have galloped full circle back to siena scene i the rev john giuliani a birkenstock shod zenlike catholic priest and prominent artist nosing about siena 's narrow streets stumbles into a bacchanalian parade reminiscent of the romans horses banners hundreds of shouting strutting men who clearly are celebrating a victory welcoming arms yank the priest into the parade celebrants shout it 's him he has arrived he is here the throng calls him joe he is marched to a grand chapel where a banquet is spread before him he is baffled he thinks of the date aug 16 it is one day after a horse race has taken place in the city ten political factions called contradas compete each year on july 2 and aug 15 for a coveted prize a banner painted by a famed artist the banner is called the palio the race has typically been more about honor than skill more godfather than national velvet in a country long renowned for its devotion to honor and family moreso than horses father john alone in siena has by fate or coincidence suddenly become a favorite son of the victors but why he stands before the banquet hall and says kindly but firmly to the man who first embraced him sir my name is not joe it is giovanni yes yes the man mauro finetti said indulging him whatever you want to call yourself more conversation and questions and father john realizes he is in a mess the throng has confused him with that year 's palio painter joe tilson a prominent british artist father john is known enough in the states he has had well received exhibitions at the cathedral of st john the divine in manhattan the aldrich museum of contemporary art in ridgefield the new britain museum of american art universities and churches sprinkled throughout but he knows that this day in siena he is not the artist they think he is the son of an italian shoemaker from greenwich a priest whose burbling laughter is a contagion to anyone within earshot he is though and always has been an honest man embarrassed and perplexed he excuses himself and hikes up the hill to the church of st catherine he looks up at the crescent moon and says aloud as the faithful are wont to do when trapped in a breach of etiquette what do i do he decides to tell the truth the story might have ended there if father john had known his way around siena but he was lost and could not find the chapel where the winners were partying he wandered and wandered the biblical similarities not lost on him and finally found his hotel scene ii father john returns to his home the benedictine grange a 15 acre monastery in redding he writes an apologetic letter to mr finetti an architect who was that year 's president of the contrada then he goes back to painting american indian art which is what he does best and because he wants to make reparations for what the united states did to the american indian whom he calls the first spiritual presence in this land he dusts his bountiful collection of american indian and south american icons which were cheap when he started out and are now priced far beyond his meager pocketbook he cooks cleans mows irons gardens he receives a letter back from italy you are the clone of joe tilson mr finetti writes he apologizes too father john contemplates the incident as he goes about his daily work he holds yogalike meditation sessions with fellow catholics in an ascetic prayer room on the property little suffering escapes his eye in the bridgeport diocese he keeps his grange friends and himself busy with aids ministries the homeless soup kitchens wherever they can help he holds sunday mass in the church a 19th century barn unadorned except for two stained glass windows set high in the rafters that he got for a steal many years ago at united house wrecking in stamford despite his distinctly different approach to the priesthood the diocese leaves him be one day he says to himself hey i 'm an artist why do n't i offer to paint the palio he sends along a packet of his work to siena he receives a polite reply from mr finetti who says he has no authority to select the palio artist father john survives technologically by fax not phone and one day this april his fax machine clicked on and a paper slipped out it was a message from the director of the museum in siena mauro civai his heartbeat quickened which at 69 is n't always a good thing he immediately called mr civai in italy we saw your work mr civai said we would love for you to paint the palio five years had gone by since father john had been misidentified as the 1996 painter of the palio this year the palio that father john paints is dedicated to the 500th anniversary of the birth of a famous sienese botanist piero andrea mattioli when father john heard that he nearly swooned for hanging above the toilet in his little house is a poster a woodcut print of a lavender plant which he hung by a nail when he moved into the house in september 1977 in block letters beneath the woodcut is the name of the botanical artist piero andrea mattioli i 've been living with this man for 24 years now father john said the year i paint the palio is the year it is dedicated to him all these lovely synchronicities move me deeply the siena museum director sent father john a 3 by 9 foot swatch of raw silk on which he was to paint the palio he had a moment of panic he had never painted on fabric before no less fabric with the wrinkled idiosyncratic nature of raw silk he went to a local arts supply store and pleaded for help they comforted him we sell fabric paint they said he had never heard of it final scene on july 2 the horse race will be held father john will be there this year 's celebrated palio artist with a group of friends from the grange community he will stand among the dignitaries of siena watching as two oxen pull the palio in a cart through the city 's streets and watching as the horse race is run the next day the race 's gleeful winners will wave the palio aloft in their parade father john 's telling of the story is like the buildup of waves in a sea calm then gaining in height and power then crash he cracks up with laughter it 's all just too much for me to contemplate he said still laughing i had great joy great joy in doing this then he laughs his infectious laugh again drawing chortles from all about
