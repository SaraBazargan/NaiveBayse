 it has been a near constant refrain since sept 11 life will never be the same and yesterday city officials raised the possibility that one inconvenience the partial ban on single occupancy vehicles entering manhattan might become permanent it 's an intriguing question said iris weinshall the transportation commissioner have we thought about it yeah ms weinshall who appeared at a news conference with mayor rudolph w giuliani made her comments while announcing that the restrictions in place since sept 27 would be loosened today instead of prohibiting single occupancy vehicles from 6 am to 11 am on weekdays the ban has been shortened by an hour to end at 10 am vehicle counts in the area affected below 63rd street have shown a 23 percent reduction in traffic ms weinshall said making the current restrictions permanent might be easier said than done since they were enacted under emergency powers granted to mayor giuliani since sept 11 and without the special consent of the state legislature city motor vehicle laws are subject to state oversight and such consent would be required a ban is something the next mayor should take a hard look at ms weinshall said thomas j lueck
