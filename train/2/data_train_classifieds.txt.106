 art arising from ashes the busy visitors lobby of the united nations is now filled with ghosts some are of victims of war but many also belong to the living the ghosts of childhoods lost aftershocks a show presented there by the children 's movement for creative education consists of art and memoirs by two groups with good reason to mourn teenagers from the former yugoslavia and new york city children who saw the terrorist attacks of sept 11 their creations communicate many of the same emotions evoking fear and sadness but also resilience the balkan works range from edin durmisevic 's cocoon a cluster of teenagers plaster life masks that eerily recall the faceless dead to lea bebek 's war recipes a darkly comic parody that calls for preparing meager rations on fires fed by old shoes the names by emir durmisevic edin 's twin looks like a city banner it says sarajevo trailing streamers a closer examination reveals that the strips of paper are printed with the names of 10000 civilians killed on the floor is a map of europe splattered with red in breezes the streamers sway haunting and wraithlike the art by the new yorkers who are much younger is no less poignant it includes daniella d'agate 's eyes of the world are watching in which disembodied eyes look on as a plane hurtles toward the twin towers and a drawing by two sixth graders in which the sun and clouds are faces streaked with tears but the spirit of hope dwells here too in art and in words and of course in the children themselves who have the potential to right earlier generations wrongs as i am a gift a poem by third graders puts it i am a gift that forgives you aftershocks artwork and memoirs by young people growing up after war and terror through nov 26 in the visitors lobby of the united

cheering crowds and corporate sponsors banners atalanta could easily be a contestant in the recent new york city marathon but she 's wearing lace up sandals not running shoes and her races are about matters more important than money and glory life and death she 's the heroine of jonathon ward 's atalanta and the race for the golden cure a comic mix of greek mythology and green party politics directed by david anzuelo the show retains many elements of the myth about a princess who is the fleetest human alive loath to marry she challenges suitors to a race he who beats her wins her hand he who fails loses his life the gods of course take an interest in this but here they are more mammonlike than olympian represented by towering puppets created by great small works they are zeus inc

aphrodite amelia fowler those up on their greek mythology will recall that she and three golden apples influenced the outcome of the event they do in this show too but here the apples are n't golden
