 students from across the state now have some new insight into what life was like in connecticut from 1800 to 1950 a new web site called connecticut history online wwwcthis toryonlineorg offers 12500 photographs prints and drawings that illustrate the business social educational political and cultural life of the time among the images are those of a tobacco farm in east windsor a textile mill in willimantic fishing trawlers in stonington and trains in bridgeport there are photos of businesses natural disasters such as the hurricane of 1938 and a collection of 19th century drawings of towns across the state the site though is mostly about people there is a large collection of everyday people at work and play each photo is accompanied by an extensive description the site also features lesson plans and ideas for teachers about how to integrate the images into their curriculum there is also a section called journeys which offers themes such as women at work and connecticut goes to the beach selected groups of images introduce each theme and there are instructions how to find additional information on the subject the project is a collaboration between the connecticut historical society mystic seaport and the thomas j dodd research center at the university of connecticut the web site was officially started thursday we 're very very proud of this said the project director nancy finlay of the connecticut historical society not many people know about it yet i ca n't wait to see what they say when they realize it 's out there she said the web site makes the collections of the three institutions more accessible than ever in the past she said people wanting to look at photographs in the historical society 's collection would have to make an appointment go to it hartford to search its archives and then order copies of the items they wanted the process could take several weeks and often required a great deal of staff time this did n't help the kid who had a social studies project due ms finlay said now you can do it yourself and it 's instantaneous this is light years from what we could do just a year ago i ca n't believe the way it has transformed the way people can do research about 50 people from the three institutions worked to create the site using a 335000 grant from institute of museum and library services barbara sheppard the institute 's deputy director said her organization awarded the grant in 1999 because the project showed a collaboration between museum and libraries and resulted in one database that improved the accessibility of the images she said the institute saw it as a model for other states and organizations while there is a similar project in colorado and one in montana devoted to indian tribes the connecticut project is the only one of its kind in the northeast this is a real public service she said there 's a wealth of information here the seaport provided 5000 images the historical society 4000 and the dodd research center 3500 they are just a fraction of the 22 million images the three organizations have in their combined collections the quality and variety of connecticut images owned by these three institutions is astonishing said mary ann stets curator of photography at mystic seaport ms stets said the seaport which has the world 's largest collection of maritime photography not only contributed photos of boats shipbuilding and fishing but also a large number of portraits some of which feature unidentified subjects she said even those images are valuable because they offer insight into the lifestyle and dress of people from the 19th century it also provided an extensive collection of photographs of the stonington fishing fleet the state 's last surviving fleet she said the site will not only provide primary sources and show teachers how to use them but will offer a reminder that the three institutions have even greater resources to help them with their research needs most of the state 's 169 towns are represented with the hartford and southeastern connecticut areas having the most images ms finlay said the fairfield county area has the fewest and the three organizations would welcome images from groups in that area one of the more popular aspects of the site is the locator it enables the user to zoom in on a specific town or even a street to search for those images during the last 18 months there has been a pilot project online as the three organizations added images and made refinements to the site during that time teachers have also developed lesson plans and methods for using the images in the classroom one of those teachers is patricia wiedenmann who teaches fifth  and sixth grade gifted and talented students at the bear path school in hamden it 's an amazing amazing site she said it broadens the background that teachers can bring to the classroom it 's a wonderful resource for us as teachers ms wiedenmann said the images such as those that show how children dressed and played in the 1800 's create a much more lasting form of knowledge for students it 's so much more vivid than just reading about it and having it local captivates them even more she said using a computer to view the images makes it even more attractive to students she added ms wiedenmann said she used the site for a unit on immigration we hope to get other teachers interested in it she said once they start looking at it they will be able to make their own lessons from it while the project was originally designed for middle and high school students the appeal has gone far beyond that target audience we 're seeing it used by all sorts of people now ordinary people not just students ms finlay said i got a call from a man who said 'i punched in burlington and i found a picture of my grandfather 's farm we did n't appreciate how broad the appeal of this would be the three institutions are preparing another grant application for the next phase of the project it would include more photos as well as manuscripts documents museum objects oral histories and streaming video this will be the one stop shopping of connecticut history ms stets said it will be the ultimate database for this subject
