 like many politicians william f galvin has retained advisers on matters of image style and political appeal i 've had many consultants said mr galvin the massachusetts official who is leading the investigation of credit suisse first boston the nice ones put it this way 'you know you 're a stiff the less nice ones say 'you come across as a monster you do n't smile enough you 're grim but mr galvin 52 who is running for a third term as secretary of the commonwealth after a failed democratic gubernatorial bid has made few concessions to the image makers and now credit suisse first boston along with fellow investigators like eliot spitzer the attorney general of new york are also discovering the steely and uncompromising side of this boston politician mr galvin has assigned 15 investigators roughly half the staff of his securities division as well as 11 law student interns to comb through more than 250000 internal credit suisse documents he has forwarded a pile of credit suisse e mail messages to mr spitzer suggesting that they may involve criminal violations that can be prosecuted under new york securities law and barring some kind of settlement with credit suisse his office is expected to file an administrative law complaint against the firm as early as monday over evidence that its investment bankers exerted improper influence over its research analysts what we have in the csfb material is that it 's apparently company policy to pitch to prospective banking clients the fact that they would shade the analysis mr galvin said credit suisse documents obtained by newspapers have suggested that analysts were paid a portion of investment banking revenue and that some analysts felt pressured to issue positive reports on credit suisse 's investment clients in a statement credit suisse said it has been working closely with all of our state and federal regulators who believe the public interest is best served by pursuing an industrywide global resolution on these matters we remain committed to achieving reform through this process massachusetts was given jurisdiction over the credit suisse inquiry by the north american securities administrators association which comprises state regulators but the state may not be interested in a so called global settlement such an agreement could resolve state as well as federal charges in return for fines and corporate reform mr spitzer called mr galvin on oct 3 to brief him on fledgling efforts to outline a broad settlement with the securities industry but mr galvin who has developed a reputation for toughness in local battles with hmo 's insurers and securities swindlers has made clear that he is not going to approve a slap on the wrist deal a global settlement rhetorically it sounds great but what does it mean he said for it to be meaningful it must be permanent change in the way these firms operate there 's been a tendency on the part of a lot of the larger firms to get into a problem like this pay a big fine throw up their hands and say we 're never going to do it again maybe fire a few people and then go out and find a more creative way to do what they just said they 'd never do again mr galvin said he wanted stiff financial penalties along with a total divorce of securities research and investment banking you almost have to treat these people like drug dealers he said in a recent interview you have to confiscate all their ill gotten gains mr galvin 's tough stand could partly reflect difficulties in talks with credit suisse according to people close to those talks credit suisse rejected an offer from the state to settle the investigation by paying a 100 million penalty but mr galvin said there 's been no settlement offer to my knowledge and i think my knowledge is complete credit suisse declined to comment mr galvin 's political colleagues are not surprised by his defiant tone in the multistate investigation which up to this point has been dominated by mr spitzer galvin 's clearly a guy who is quite independent persistent and determined said michael s dukakis the former massachusetts governor and presidential candidate michael w morrissey a state senator who has known mr galvin since they served together in the massachusetts house said he was always well prepared he 's the type of person that if you want to go to battle you want to make sure he 's on your side mr morrissey said he does his research he 's usually one or two steps ahead of everyone else politically however mr galvin has fallen a step or two behind his peers realizing that he was unlikely to receive enough democratic convention support to make the primary ballot he dropped his bid for governor in january mr galvin offered the explanation that everybody does n't think i 'm charming michael goldman a democratic political consultant who worked for some of mr galvin 's rivals seeking a primary nomination said he 's not a colorful guy he 's not the kind of boisterous back slapping irish politician people think of when they think of boston politicians mr galvin whose mother immigrated from ireland and whose american born father was raised in ireland attended parochial schools and boston college before earning a law degree at suffolk university an urban campus visible from his current statehouse perch on beacon hill before winning the first of seven terms in the massachusetts house mr galvin built a private practice as an election law expert which he described in a seemingly rare humorous foray as seasonal work since his 1994 election as secretary of the commonwealth mr galvin has worked to simplify and expand voter registration wary of problems with punchcard ballots mr galvin banned them in massachusetts in 1997 three years before they became an issue in the presidential election he knows election law cold said mr dukakis during the fight over the florida ballots campaign officials for al gore asked for mr galvin 's advice he urged them unsuccessfully to demand a statewide recount the gore folks made a big mistake to try to cherry pick where they thought they 'd win to pick up the margin mr galvin said you either recount it all or you do n't recount at all in recovering funds for victims of securities fraud and in requiring periodic exams of financial advisers he has earned a reputation as an investor champion but a sense of betrayal now reinforces his zeal during his first few years as secretary of the commonwealth his office was responsible for approving the sale of initial public offerings in massachusetts the national securities market improvement act of 1996 gave the federal government control over the approval process mr galvin said he would have approved far fewer stock offerings had he known how public offering allocations were abused i was taken in he said i do n't like being used i do n't like being deceived
