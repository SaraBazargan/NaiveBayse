 the track of qlogic seems to illustrate that sanity has returned to the technology sector after three long years qlogic makes switches and controllers that manage the flow of data between computers and their storage systems unlike many other technology companies it has managed to remain profitable over the last two years in its fiscal 2003 which ends march 31 qlogic is expected to earn 108 million or 115 a share on sales of 440 million and the company has a beautiful balance sheet with about 600 million in cash and no debt excluding that cash at friday 's close of 3568 a share qlogic trades at about 25 times earnings which does not seem unreasonable for a company whose profit margins approach those of microsoft but some short sellers and analysts argue that qlogic is less enticing than it first appears the case they make should give pause to anyone who thinks that tech stocks are ready to rally qlogic 's exceptional margins result largely from the fact that it has only one major competitor emulex in its most important business making host bus adapters do n't ask right now it 's a duopoly said ashok kumar a technology analyst at us bancorp piper jaffray but in the next year a new generation of technology based on open standards will hit the market and qlogic and emulex will face new competition they 'll have to try to compete against the intels and the broadcoms of the world and they do n't have a prayer mr kumar said it 's a disaster waiting to happen even before then qlogic faces the risk that fujitsu its largest customer providing one sixth of its sales will exit the disk drive business you have technology transition risk and you have customer risk mr kumar said these are clear and present dangers he said fiscal 2004 when qlogic is expected to make about 130 a share could be its peak earnings year h k desai chairman of qlogic said it had planned for two years for a potential transition to new standards and was prepared to compete with anyone we are technology agnostics mr desai said in any case the transition will probably happen more slowly than mr kumar expects because companies are loath to adopt a new standard if their current systems are working mr desai said and even if fujitsu quits the business qlogic may lose no more than 8 percent of its overall sales because it will gain business with other customers mr desai said qlogic 's shares are certainly a better bet today than they were at the height of the technology bubble in march 2000 when they reached 190 but given the risks should they really trade at 25 times earnings qlogic is a solid well run company but even after falling 80 percent in three years it may be overpriced relative to its growth prospects and competitive position in this it 's hardly alone consider oracle trading at 30 times 2003 earnings or sun microsystems losing money now and selling at 35 times estimated earnings for its 2004 fiscal year investors are paying those prices because they believe that big technology companies will be able to return to the profit levels they had at the peak three years ago but those profits resulted from a once in a generation binge in technology investment fueled by the year 2000 software changeover and huge spending from newly public internet companies they are not coming back not for a while technology remains a brutal business with short product cycles and constant compression in prices and margins unless you happen to be microsoft so it 's hard to understand why these companies justify multiples above the market 's average price to earnings ratio now about 15 get used to it
