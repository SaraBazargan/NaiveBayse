 provence may be touted as france 's choicest playground but in 2500 years it has been attacked by greeks romans goths franks vandals and saracens every variety of invader seems to have subjected it to the extremes of pillage destruction naked war lawrence durrell wrote it was as if its beauty was too much for them and they went berserk traders followed the invaders in the early 1600 's portuguese and dutch ships put in at marseille with among other exotic imports calico chintz and printed cottons from india known even in english as indiennes the gaily colored prints were immediately embraced by louis xiv in 1664 he had his minister colbert form the compagnie des indes orientales to import indian fabrics and goods the company sent spies to india to learn the secrets of printing and dyeing the cottons the nobility adopted the colorful indiennes for court dress moliere satirized the vogue in his first production of le bourgeois gentilhomme in 1670 outfitting his hero in a rainbow of printed indiennes intentionally worn upside down french textile producers set up workshops to make indiennes and began a thriving business they carved flowers arabesques and other motifs on laminated blocks of fruitwood then applied the blocks to the cotton by hand one color at a time using natural dyes made from plants and minerals the colors were strong and vibrant blue the color of a gauloise cigarette box mustard yellow terra cotta red and raspberry pink lavender and bright green over time new motifs were incorporated local vines flowers insects and herbs provencal women liked to cover themselves with the luxuriant foliage indiennes were worn in layers as scarves aprons blouses and long quilted skirts men wore vests and doublets in provence one could determine people 's social rank by the style of indienne bedecked clothes they wore by the late 17th century french made indiennes achieved such popularity that jealous wool and silk makers persuaded the government to ban their production in france though unevenly enforced the interdiction lasted from 1686 until 1759 the government did n't mind instituting the decree the compagnie des indes earned a lot of money said colette nicollin president and owner of souleiado the major producer of provencal cottons today in france indian cottons were very expensive not to be thwarted after the royal ban provencal manufacturers moved to the comtat venaissin a part of france near avignon that was under the jurisdiction of the popes until the french revolution souleiado is not the only producer of such prints today but it is the oldest established in 1806 in a former capuchin convent near tarascon an ancient roman city on the banks of the rhone under different names the company has been owned by just a few families for two centuries never ceasing production despite wars and revolutions in 1916 it was bought by charles henri demery who passed it down to his nephew charles demery in 1937 in 1939 it was named souleiado the word in old provencal means a ray of sun shining through the clouds after a rain the printing workshops were installed in a 17th century limestone hotel particulier a mansion situated between a courtyard and a garden in the center of tarascon where it remains the younger demery adopted the indiennes for home decoration fashion faience and accessories in 1950 he opened the first souleiado boutique in florence demand so exceeded supply that he began to have the cottons printed in factories instead of by hand blocking in 1977 charles demery brought the company back to life said michel biehn a decorator based near tarascon mr biehn who owns la maison biehn a source of rare vintage provencal textiles and costumes wrote a 1987 book on traditional costumes made with indiennes his view is shared by karl friberg chief executive of motif designs in new rochelle ny the wholesale distributor of souleiado fabrics and wallpaper in the united states charles demery had so much charisma he did n't need to be a good businessman mr friberg said francophiles loved whatever he sold americans embraced souleiado in the 1970 's after pierre moulin and pierre levec started displaying the colorful prints in their greenwich village antiques shop pierre deux in 1984 these dealers wrote with linda dannenberg pierre deux 's french country a book that popularized souleiado along with provencal antiques pottery gardens and decor eventually they sold their name to an investment group that started the pierre deux stores which carried souleiado goods when the company was restructured
