 every time milton m berger thinks about the first montauk jazz festival an event he and a friend dreamed up last september he says he feels anxious dr berger a psychiatrist and his friend robert marshall a manhattan psychologist who weekends on the east end hatched the idea for the benefit concert while trolling for striped bass off montauk aboard dr berger 's 21 foot powerboat my fantasy they were brainstorming about how to raise money to pay for renovations to the montauk community arts center when the idea for a jazz festival popped up the center which operates out of the former long island rail road station in montauk is home to the montauk artists association of which dr berger is a member the organization leases the former station from the railroad for 1 a year now the two men are devoting countless hours organizing the festival they 've enlisted the support of three area residents louis profera a bridgehampton dentist hy brodsky a retired public relations specialist and wallace a smith general manager of wpbx 883 fm and planned a daylong jazz jamboree that is expected to draw 350 people at 150 a ticket cablevision and wpbx have agreed to co sponsor the two day event which will begin on friday with a dinner dance this is the biggest event i have ever planned dr berger said it 's a lot of work a lot of worry and a lot of sleepless anxiety ridden hours but if all goes well we plan to make this an annual event the jamboree is scheduled to begin at 1 pm next saturday at the top of the downs at montauk downs state park and is expected to run well into the evening it is a tribute to the jazz bassist percy heath a longtime resident of montauk and president of the montauk artists association mr heath and his band the heath brothers have volunteered to headline the festival which they hope will raise 150000 to build classrooms a darkroom and lecture hall on the building 's second floor the former station 's first floor waiting area serves as an art gallery where local artists display their work chico hamilton an east hampton resident and his quintet are on the program along with the eddie locke quartet the jerry sokolov quintet the michael kanan trio and the bob berg group mr berg is a resident of springs the friday dinner and swing dance will be held at the top of the downs and will feature great neck resident ken james and his big band tickets are 200 and include admission to the jamboree planning an event of this magnitude was a lot more work than dr berger and the four volunteers who make up the committee imagined since october they 've booked the talent scouted and selected the location and drafted publicity materials including logos posters and stationery they 've lined up corporate sponsors hired caterers and designed tickets as the date for the festival got closer they raced all over the east end taping posters in store windows and hotel lobbies and running to the post office to mail off fliers and invitations they say it has been a huge effort with twice monthly meetings and countless phone calls to discuss a variety of issues at times it has even been comical mr brodsky related a story of how he went to his old rolodex to pitch the idea to reporters at one new york newspaper but when he dialed the number on his index card he learned that the organization had moved when he tried to call a national magazine he had regularly pitched he met with a similar situation but he managed to get the job done i 'm delighted to be a part of it mr heath said i will be in the company of a lot of great musicians who are friends of mine and i am grateful that they thought of making this concert a tribute to me mr heath said that he was 24 years old and fresh out of the army where he was a member of the all black tuskegee airmen when he bought his first bass and taught himself to play a year later he was in paris playing with the pianist and composer john lewis and the vibraphonist milt jackson as a member of the modern jazz quartet he went on to perform with such stars as charlie parker j j johnson dizzy gillespie miles davis john coltrane zoot sims dexter gordon sonny rollins and jackie mclean his whirlwind schedule and months on the road prompted him to take summers off and rent a lakeside house in montauk where he spent days with his wife june and nights fishing for stripers and fluke off the beaches with his three sons percy iii jason and stuart who became an east end fisherman no one knew who this black guy with the white wife and three boys in brooks brothers shorts was he said and i liked it that way now everyone in montauk recognizes mr heath who dresses casually often wearing fishing boots and a baseball cap when he heads into town to pick up the morning paper in 1993 he and his wife sold their home in springfield gardens queens and bought their dream house just up the hill from the one the family once rented in montauk that same year he helped found the montauk artists association at the suggestion of the artist joe bucci to promote art appreciation on the east end the organization got a lift in 1999 when it won a grant from the new york state council on the arts to offer weekly workshops for children in montauk it has also secured a grant from the town of east hampton to begin doing some initial renovations to the nearly century old station house which has its old ticket window and original mahogany benches previous fundraising efforts have enabled the association to undertake small projects like basic electrical repairs and painting but members said that in order to serve the community better they need to update and improve the second floor we 've done other fundraising efforts in the past but this is the big one dr berger said this time we are going all the way the montauk jazz festival is scheduled for 8 pm friday and 1 pm saturday at montauk downs state park information 631 668 5336
