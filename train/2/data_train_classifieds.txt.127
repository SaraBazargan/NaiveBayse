italy q are there ryanair type low price airlines in italy particularly flying between venice and palermo charles f brydon seattle a there are roughly 20 airlines operating in italy but no true discount carrier along the lines of the irish airline ryanair according to journalists reporting on the aviation industry and the airlines themselves only one airline flies nonstop between venice and palermo alpi eagles which operates mainly in the north of the country with a few destinations elsewhere in europe it has 19 flights a week between those cities with the round trip fares including taxes running from 233 to 390 at 105 euros to the dollar but if you do n't mind a stop in rome flying alitalia will probably be cheaper with round trip fares starting at 172 for alpi eagle reservations call 39 41 599 7788 or go to wwwalpieaglescom for alitalia in the united states call 800 223 5730 or go to wwwalitaliausacom a widely held belief is that italy has not developed discount carriers because the domestic market mostly serves business travelers experts say they are willing to pay higher fares to fly into more convenient airports for better meals on good china for home delivery of tickets and other amenities the popularity of luxury business travel has led to the success of for example air dolomiti 39 04 5860 5211 and www airdolomitiit en indexasp which serves northern cities primarily and offers such pampering alitalia 's only major competitor in the italian market is airone 39 06 488 800 and wwwair oneit which offers better fares than the former state owned airline on some routes milan venice for example one way tickets can be 70 percent cheaper than on alitalia but the savings on round trip fares is usually far less perhaps 40 or 50 so booking two one way trips at different times may be worth considering french classes in paris q i 'd like to find an intensive conversational french class in paris like those open to foreign students attending
