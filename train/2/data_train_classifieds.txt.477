 the director of the federal emergency management agency promised members of the new york congressional delegation yesterday that the agency would immediately reopen more than 7000 applications for housing assistance that the agency denied after the sept 11 terrorist attacks the director joseph m allbaugh said he had ordered the review because of what he called a perception that fema has denied assistance to those who should have received it he said that the thousands of rejected cases would be reviewed by a select group of caseworkers and that steps would be taken to avoid misunderstandings about exactly who is eligible and to ensure that all eligible cases are assisted the announcement came after days of increasing criticism in congress about the agency 's performance in responding to the sept 11 attacks to date the agency has disbursed far less in individual assistance to people economically affected by the attacks than it has in most major disasters in part because it has rejected 7 out of 10 applicants for housing aid the problems with the agency 's distribution of aid were detailed in the new york times last week mr allbaugh 's decision will affect applications to the agency 's mortgage and rental assistance program which covers up to 18 months of mortgage or rent payments for anyone in a major disaster area who lost at least 25 percent of his income as a result of the catastrophe local relief officials at first expected that the fema housing aid program would offer just the sort of assistance needed to address the deep widespread economic damage caused by the terrorist attacks government officials have estimated that about 75000 jobs and 45 billion in income were lost to people in the new york disaster region but interviews and the agency 's own records show that those who were rejected included hundreds of chinatown seamstresses and manhattan hotel workers many of them with claims to aid that seemed legitimate in one case raised with the agency by representatives jerrold nadler and nita m lowey both new york democrats the agency denied help to a disabled veteran who sold hats and gloves on the sidewalks of lower broadway even though he provided sworn statements from shopkeepers confirming that he was a regular vendor in the area this was uncharacteristic of fema said senator charles e schumer democrat of new york i have a lot of faith that this will be corrected and corrected quickly in a letter to mr nadler yesterday mr allbaugh encouraged him to forward to the agency any specific cases that have not been approved but which appear such as those mentioned in your letter to be obvious cases for assistance the housing aid rejection rate much higher than in previous disasters is part of the reason that the federal emergency management agency has provided less than 65 million in individual assistance for families in the disaster area by comparison the agency ultimately spent more than 14 billion in similar direct financial help to families affected by the northridge earthquake in california in 1994 the agency has acknowledged that one reason the payouts have been low is that thousands of people were denied housing aid after the agency decided to limit benefits to those who could prove that their lost income was a direct result of the attacks that new standard which goes beyond the laws and regulations that have traditionally governed disaster relief efforts substantially raised the burden of proof on jobless workers trying to qualify in addition some agency officials said their housing assistance efforts had been plagued by missteps in one some 15000 people received faulty aid applications that increased the risk of rejection mr allbaugh 's announcement yesterday does not specifically address the new direct result requirement which he defended in a recent interview as a fiscally responsible way of preventing unemployed workers far from the designated disaster areas from claiming assistance but he did agree to meet with members of congress from the region to discuss the criteria for qualifying for the program said senator jon s corzine a democrat from new jersey fema 's apparent decision to change the eligibility standard without any basis in law to do so could be depriving thousands of the assistance they need to keep their homes pay their bills and feed their families mr corzine said in a letter to mr allbaugh on tuesday yesterday mr corzine said that mr allbaugh indicated that the direct result standard is how he is being told he has to interpret the statute both mr corzine and mr schumer said that they had volunteered to work with the federal agency on any statutory changes necessary to extend and improve the housing aid program which is scheduled to expire this month mr schumer said he had been assured by mr allbaugh that new york would ultimately get all the aid it deserved but he is concerned that if we do n't clarify the law people in cincinnati will claim eligibility for the program mr schumer said the agency 's role in the continuing relief efforts for people in new york and northern virginia including those thrown out of work when reagan national airport was temporarily closed is increasingly important major charities have for months been cutting back on their aid to economic victims of the attacks whose unemployment benefits will soon expire some officials at the agency who opposed the tightened standard said privately that the high rejection rate for the housing aid program demonstrated that thousands of needy families facing eviction or foreclosure were unable to meet the stricter standard on sunday a coalition of community organizations including the chinese staff and workers association and the puerto rican legal defense and education fund will hold a town hall meeting in front of the federal emergency management agency 's offices at 141 worth street in lower manhattan to focus attention on problems their members have had in dealing with the agency correction may 3 2002 friday a front page article yesterday about the federal emergency management agency 's reopening of more than 7000 rejected applications for housing aid misstated the location for a meeting called by community groups with complaints about the agency it will be 2 to 5 pm on sunday at public school 124 40 division street in manhattan not at 141 worth street
