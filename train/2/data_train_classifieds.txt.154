 hitting yet another snag in its nascent internet service the comcast corporation said yesterday that it was scrambling to repair an e mail failure that had left as many as 300000 customers unable to receive messages starting at 10 pm wednesday customers were able to receive e mail messages intermittently but by noon yesterday they were unable to receive them at all said dave watson executive vice president for marketing at comcast mr watson said the company hoped to restore full e mail service by late last night but if not would work around the clock to do so this is just the latest stumble for comcast a cable operator that provides high speed internet access to about 950000 customers until last year comcast provided the service in partnership with excite home but when excite home went bankrupt comcast set out to build its own internet network initially comcast infuriated many internet subscribers particularly in the new jersey and detroit areas who said they could not get access to e mail and the web then earlier this week the company faced criticism from privacy advocates who said comcast was tracking subscriber internet traffic patterns in a way that could allow it to follow individual surfing habits comcast announced on wednesday that it would modify its practices in the latest trouble mr watson said the company had a problem with its e mail distribution servers which are powerful computers responsible for distributing to individual users the e mail messages received by the comcast system mr watson said the servers had continued to receive incoming mail and were storing it for distribution when the technical problem was solved mr watson said the problem affected only users who relied on a comcast e mail account and that subscribers who relied on a different service like a residual one from home were unaffected in a larger sense mr watson said the problems for comcast are a result of the effort to deploy an internet service in very short order these are early stage issues he said noting that other internet companies have faced similar problems but that 's not an excuse for us the problems also hark back to legal arguments made by excite home when it went bankrupt excite home sought to put pressure on its cable partners like comcast and att to pay more for its service arguing that they were underestimating the difficulty and expense of operating an internet network
