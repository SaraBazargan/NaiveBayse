 nato is getting bigger but what 's it for this november the north atlantic treaty organization now an alliance of 19 countries is likely to expand by another 6 or 7 in what the bush administration has called a robust enlargement after the bitter debate in the senate and elsewhere over the last enlargement to the east in 1999 the lack of controversy now is deafening for many in washington the silence has an easy explanation after sept 11 this pact for cold war containment does not really matter any more at least not as a military alliance central to america 's global tasks the old enemy moscow chose after sept 11 to be more of a friend if less than an ally so what should nato become or should it simply pass into history its job well done no one wants to kill nato and there are serious efforts under way to transform it to make it quicker more mobile more precise and more effective even as it enlarges to complete the reunification of europe and develops a new relationship with russia at a meeting in iceland this week secretary of state colin l powell dismissed talk of nato irrelevance saying it 's very hard to close down when people are standing in line to get in many europeans agree nato must remain the centerpiece of trans atlantic security policy said friedbert pfluger a christian democratic member of parliament here that requires the europeans to become militarily stronger but the americans must understand that making nato irrelevant is a bad idea for washington too but secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld is said to have been unimpressed with the alliance when he served as ambassador to nato in 1973 74 douglas j feith the under secretary of defense for policy has joked about nato keep the myth alive with president bush preparing to give a major speech about europe and nato here next thursday the often quarrelsome officials of the state and defense departments are quarreling now over what he should say there is a lot of cynicism in washington over whether the european allies will ever spend enough money to live up to their commitments and keep nato relevant to american needs european officials are trying to influence the debate knowing that they can not defend the continent without nato and worrying that if washington treats the alliance as irrelevant the european motivation to spend more on defense will evaporate our fear is that the us could use nato to keep a foot in europe but make it militarily irrelevant and use it as some kind of toolbox from which to take the parts you want for any mission mr pfluger said the arguments boil down to what role an enlarged nato should play should it be modernized to remain the main instrument for projecting military power for the united states and its allies or should it take on the serious but less compelling mission of being a sort of political talking shop that can help democratize the rest of europe stabilize the balkans modernize central asia and bring the russians into a serious collaborative relationship with the west for much of the pentagon the lessons of the 1999 kosovo war nato 's first and the fight against the taliban and al qaeda are simple the united states is best off fighting its global battles itself without the complications of a formal alliance but with some help from a coalition of the able the british a few others like the french and germans who can help fill in the gaps or later keep the peace on the ground in this view enlargement is essentially political and does not matter because neither washington nor moscow regard nato as militarily significant any longer the gap in military spending and capability between the united states and the rest of nato has been growing so large as to make nato seem irrelevant the alliance 's secretary general lord robertson is disappointed that the european allies did not use the events of sept 11 to rally their populations around the need to spend more on the military the choice for europe he has said is modernization or marginalization lord robertson is pressing for a modernized nato with a global reach the nato toolbox will be big including rapid reaction forces he said in an interview and i personally will resist people taking individual tools from that box as some in the pentagon would like to do nato 's credibility depends on its military capability lord robertson who met with mr bush in april said his view was winning in washington but he and senior american officials believe they must work to present a positive picture of what nato will be nato has been considered dead before but it found a new post soviet role in the balkans in bosnia kosovo and macedonia but this probably delayed a fundamental examination of what nato stands for there is no question that this is a defining transformational year for nato said the american ambassador to the alliance r nicholas burns richard c holbrooke a former ambassador to germany and to the united nations said nato is our strategic presence in europe it is indispensable to our own national security for political logistical and military reasons even the world 's greatest superpower ca n't go it alone after sept 11 a senior administration official said nato has gone global committing to operations outside europe and dealing with new contingencies and threats lord robertson and other nato officials set out several military goals for the leaders who will meet in prague beyond enlargement and russia the meeting should focus on strategic lift to get troops out of europe by air on rapid reaction forces on more precision guided munitions on better air to air refueling capacity on secure communications that are alliancewide and on establishing missile defenses even then the question of what nato is for remains fuzzy said ronald d asmus a former deputy assistant secretary of state for europe in the 1990 's the question was whether you could stabilize the rest of europe the east and the balkans without a train wreck with russia he said today having largely succeeded in that and now after 9 11 the question is can the united states and europe come up with a common strategy to deal with this new challenge of the greater middle east if nato does n't address the central strategic issue of our time which is terrorism weapons of mass destruction and the remaking of the middle east it will cease to be america 's premier alliance editors note may 31 2002 friday an article on may 19 about the future of nato particularly after its expansion next fall discussed whether the alliance is still relevant it quoted a joke said to be making the rounds in washington keep the myth alive and attributed the remark to douglas j feith under secretary of defense for policy associates of mr feith said he had been overheard making the remark but the times should have asked him about it he says he has never uttered those words or anything of the kind and stresses that he is a supporter of nato considering the alliance crucial to the security of the democracies of europe and north america
