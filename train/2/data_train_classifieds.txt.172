 a decade has passed since fox acquired national football league television rights and established rupert murdoch 's network as a viable competitor to its three rivals the fox contingent that vowed to nfl owners that it would respect the game launch broadcast television 's first one hour pregame show and expand the game 's technological vistas was not completely certain that the league would jettison cbs after 38 years i went home to england and told my wife joan 'it 'll never happen said david hill chairman of the fox sports television group who was running murdoch 's sky sports at the time not in my wildest dreams did i think the league would let cbs go but money did not just talk it hollered fox would spend an average 395 million annually through 1997 for the national football conference contract fox 's pre emptive maneuver helped raise television sports rights fees while revolutionizing sports broadcasts with innovations that included the fox box pregame comics and ultra slow motion replays the nfl gave fox a platform to strengthen a weak station lineup and create a miniempire outstripped by only espn 's manifest destiny fox subsequently acquired additional sports rights including those to major league baseball and nascar it created cable 's fox sports net which works better as a confederation of regional sports networks that carry local games than as a full fledged national network competing with espn fox sports net tried and failed for example to sustain a news operation against sportscenter all of this sprang from the football contract fox developed the fox box the catchercam and the glowing hockey puck installed a football field in its nfl studio added microphones to bases and outfield walls sandwiched replays between whooshes and in cooperation with nbc and tnt inaugurated the satellite based nascar driver identification system fox 's presence is the prime reason for the increase in rights fees fees that would eventually cause the network to write off 909 million from the value of its nascar major league baseball and nfl deals its macho boisterous and carefree attitude has yielded comedians and a female weather forecaster with sex appeal on its fox nfl sunday studio program along with the nightly guyfest led by the comic actor tom arnold on fox sports net 's best damn sports show period a title that perfectly illustrates the fox ethos dick ebersol the chairman of nbc sports said they demystified a lot of stuff and showed that you can have a lot of fun some of us disagreed with some of it but it was the right thing to do the fox box with the score clock and other information in an upper corner of the tv screen symbolizes fox 's investment in graphic and electronic technology hill developed it in 1992 for soccer on sky sports murdoch 's satellite service in england after watching a match that offered the viewer little basic information it was one rainy sunday afternoon and for reasons i 'm not sure of i was very attached to the chelsea football club he said i 'm watching for 20 minutes i do n't know the score or when it started and i 'm going nuts his wife asked him to tone down his language hill told her if i ever do soccer i 'll put the time and score up so people wo n't be in this position not long after the fox box appeared on sky an espn production official saw it and adapted it for its world cup telecasts in 1994 hill then brought it to football hockey and baseball and all other networks with nbc 's belated acquiescence followed suit each adapting in its own way in recent years the fox box has morphed into a strip across the top of the screen hill now hopes to expand upon the recent mega slo mo technology which brought a new dimension to baseball replays to find a way to show a ball wrap around a bat at the moment of impact neal pilson who was the president of cbs sports when it lost its nfl rights admires much of what fox has created though he is not enthusiastic about pregame comedians and buxom weather forecasters they 've never felt constrained by prior practices pilson an industry consultant said they brought a bold attitude to sports that really broke up the three network club that existed before they arrived one can easily argue that the addition of the comedian jimmy kimmel to fox 's nfl pregame show in 1999 led to abc sports in 2000 hiring the caustic comic dennis miller for monday night football and one can draw a straight line between the success of the raucous over the top style of fox nfl sunday and cbs 's continued efforts to bring a similar camaraderie and notice to its rival program the nfl today what is undeniable is that fox 's aggressive moves to acquire sports properties as building blocks for a stronger network led industry rights fees to soar fox became the fourth bidder in an arena accustomed to three had fox never entered the nfl bidding the league may not have secured its eight year 18 billion deal which includes cbs but not nbc now paying an average 500 million a year abc and espn may not have paid 600 million over five years to take nhl rights away from fox in 1999 and possibly nascar would not be entering the fourth year of a 28 billion deal with fox nbc and tnt hill said that fox lost the bidding for the rights to carry the pga tour the ncaa men 's basketball tournament and the olympics we are he said tongue seemingly in cheek tempered in all ways
