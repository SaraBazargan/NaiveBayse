 two years ago when america online the cheeky internet powerhouse announced that it was buying time warner the paragon of offline publishing and entertainment it was seen as confirmation that new media had officially overpowered the old then the internet boom imploded and conventional wisdom celebrated the return of established media firms to dominating the consumption of culture both views are out of date what is evolving is neither new media nor old but a complicated creature that has media companies searching for ways to fuse elements of both into a single and profitable hybrid the success of the new management team announced yesterday at aol time warner analysts said may depend on its crossbreeding skills the new media paradigm is gone said tom wolzien a senior media analyst at sanford c bernstein what you have is the old idea that where people are spending time is an opportunity to sell to them but they are spending time in new places the plunge in share prices of internet media stars like yahoo and aol may belie the continuing impact of the internet in america 's media habits in part that impact may be disguised by the continuing downturn in the economy which has both new and old media struggling to find advertisers who want to sell to their audiences but last week a report by the center for communication policy at the university of california at los angeles said that television watching was down by 4 1 2 hours a week among americans who used the internet compared with those who did not it has been clear for a while that the internet is not going to single handedly overturn older media and that there are huge audiences for conventional media properties like harry potter and the new britney spears album the trick for media companies is how to make their new and old media divisions act like more than the sum of their parts and it is one that all of them are trying to perform with less than complete success for things like sports and music that live really well online and on television i think it 's crazy not to integrate it said judy mcgrath president of mtv i do n't think it 's one or the other i think it 's a new kind of synthesis the main old new fusion project at mtv which is owned by viacom is called mtv360 which schedules programming to its viewers across its cable channels and its web site directing them from one location to another the program is based on research indicating that the young viewers who watch mtv are watching television at the same time they are communicating on the internet that kind of cross promotion was one of the driving ideas behind aol and time warner 's merger in addition the presumption was that aol 's subscriber base would continue to grow as it has aol 's 32 million subscribers spend an average of 70 minutes online a day during prime time aol attracts about 32 million simultaneous users almost twice that of any cable network the idea was that companies who are in the places where people are migrating as well as where they already are stand a better chance of surviving cbs is often cited as an example of a media company that lost an important audience by failing to move to cable fast enough the splintering of media platforms has companies scrambling to deliver entertainment and information on television radio the internet video game platforms wireless hand held devices and cellphones i do n't think anything takes over anything else said robert w pittman the former chief executive of aol who became the sole chief operating officer of aol time warner yesterday what happens is the lines get very very blurry mr pittman said the company saw an opportunity to increase the amount the average household spends on aol service from 20 per month to 150 by offering old media products like magazine subscriptions and other information and services through its new media outlets he said it might be possible to coax 200 per month out of each home that now subscribes to its cable service for 60 per month by selling other aol time warner products although company executives acknowledge privately that it may have taken longer than they wished aol time warner made its first major foray into cross promotions with the release last month of the harry potter movie which was heavily promoted on aol in advertising information features and chat room sessions other efforts to mix old media and new include a service that allows aol users to watch the latest edition of cnn headline news from the top no matter how many minutes of the hour are gone when they double click on their computer icons one of the goals of the merger was that we would operate as one mr pittman added that 's what we 've been doing and intend to keep doing the degree to which aol really did take over time warner may be more evident in the company 's culture than in its products some media executives said time warner was known for a decentralized structure in which the executives at its individual units had great autonomy now the chief executives at its operating units meet every other week with senior corporate management at least from a cost perspective it seems like it 's the aol culture that 's driving it said frank biondi a former viacom chief executive who is senior managing director at waterview advisors an investment advising company they 've been in there cutting costs taking higher priced cash people and changing them to stock and compensation that cultural shift may spread to other media firms as well but the need for central control may be greater at aol because it is so big in terms of market capitalization the company is twice the size of viacom four times the size of disney and nine times the size of gannett according to mr wolzien of sanford c bernstein own it all mr wolzien said that 's the new paradigm according to aol
