 the politicians and propagandists who wage our war on drugs have really outdone themselves after bloating the prisons and creating a vast antidrug industrial complex they have now bribed our networks to deliver prime time audiences for indoctrination and even corralled many newspapers as do good collaborators not even during the cold war with our faith in democracy at stake did federal authorities dare so to subsidize and subvert our media back then congress explicitly forbade the agencies promoting anti communism notably the united states information agency its voice of america and even the central intelligence agency to aim their propaganda at americans why because everyone understood that the government 's heavy hand on the scale of public opinion could distort the weight of any argument and diminish the public 's freedom that principle seems in urgent need of reinforcement for it has been shown that the bait of a few million dollars was all it took to get our once fiercely independent broadcasters to submit to government tutelage and to lure many papers including the times into taking government rewards for what appeared to be independent public service the furtive broadcast scheme was discovered by daniel forbes a writer for saloncom the internet magazine and covered with due concern by a few newspapers in response president clinton and the television industry made light of their collusion and disclosed the lesser involvement of their newspaper critics just a bit of chummy cooperation in a good cause they argued when their two years of secret dealing became known the times for its part explained that it was rendering only advertising and circulation services without affecting its news coverage or content i would like to believe that the broadcasters collaboration though deplorable had nothing to do with government 's recent gifts to them of spectrum space worth about 70billion and of regulations permitting unprecedented concentrations of station ownership and i know the newspapers think they merit praise not blame for disseminating socially useful messages but it is odd that an industry usually quick to wrap itself in the first amendment would so readily invite the government to read and influence the content of tv programs and accept government rewards for community service this sad bending of principle began in 1997 when gen barry r mccaffrey who heads the office of national drug control policy at the white house was authorized by congress to spend up to 1 billion over five years to buy television time and newspaper ads to agitate against drug use to take the curse off this media subsidy congress insisted on paying only half price for every ad purchased it wanted another run free of charge but when a booming economy made commercial time scarce and expensive the networks longed for relief from their commitment to discounts so they were told they could meet their obligation by another route rather than matching the government 's paid ads one for one the broadcasters were invited to plant antidrug messages in their prime time dramas and sitcoms and newspapers were allowed to exchange ad space for things like teaching guides and pamphlets in the case of the times pamphlets were distributed with a sales pitch for school subscriptions in belatedly hinting at all these deals at a little noticed congressional hearing last fall general mccaffrey never let on that his office had been turned into a full blown script review board it decided which tv stories and newspaper programs were on message and on strategy which needed guidance and improvement and how much relief from matching ad time or space each message and activity was worth without apparent hesitation the networks showered the white house with scripts and tapes that could qualify for reward including even unfinished scripts that could still be altered though their producers and writers were never told of the practice almost all major shows were at some time offered for credit the simpsons ally mcbeal law and order the drew carey show beverly hills 90210 cosby home improvement and many more a show that portrayed parents confronting a joint smoking child in ways the white house deemed effective could redeem the equivalent of two or three 30 second ads worth at least 100000 an even larger amount might be earned by showing a youth resisting peer pressure to take up cocaine and if a whole story line were judged helpful well then shows like er or the practice to offer just two examples recouped commercial time worth a million dollars or more some network executives accepted the government 's guidance to reshape a script some badgered unsuspecting writers to insert antidrug messages into their plots one producer john tinker recalls being urged to rush ahead with an antidrug script of chicago hope even though it had been kicking around unappreciated for years several hundred newspapers and their web sites also took in white house ads and matched them in different ways besides running a free ad for every paid one the times won credits for its schools pamphlets which the white house checked simply for accuracy the best proof that the arrangement was dangerously misguided is that it was long treated as secret when the story broke abc announced that it had stopped participating after the government had asked it to submit all scripts in advance calling this a misconception the white house promised to end all previews and to settle for post broadcast reviews this may dispel the odor of censorship but it leaves in place the payments of government payola for propaganda if that represents high minded media service why stop with antidrug scenarios why not pay the media for shielding young minds from sex and gunplay and one day soon depending on which party controls the government purse why not subsidize scripts and ads that sanction or discourage abortion president clinton artfully distinguished the antidrug payola from any effort to regulate content and general mccaffrey 's spokesman said we do not clear scripts our objective is to provide a better understanding of the drug issue a much better use of public money would be to re educate all concerned in the values of first amendment independence our public officials obviously need reminding that they belong in front of the camera not behind it and our media executives should have learned long ago that those who feed at government honeypots inevitably get stuck correction march 19 2000 sunday the word image column on feb 6 referred incorrectly to the white house 's monitoring of television scripts for financial credits to broadcasters although the monitoring was not widely reported it was not treated as a government secret
