 the music industry may not like to put it in such stark terms but in 2001 it will bet on a business strategy that could undermine one of its sacred institutions the full length album this discrete packaging of 8 to 12 songs sold in record album form then eight track tape cassette and compact disc may have competition under the new business models being considered by the recording companies specifically the biggest recording companies are preparing to roll out subscription based services on the internet initially such services will enable users to listen to an entire catalog of music for a flat monthly fee eventually many in the industry envision that such services will allow users to download the music in their cars or portable players the record companies imagine that service as a bottomless on demand jukebox the idea is that when subscribers quit paying their access to the music will disappear and the music they have already downloaded will expire but no one knows for sure whether consumers will go for such a service the record companies argue that the explosive popularity of napster the free online file sharing service that remains under legal assault suggests they will because the labels say it demonstrates the allure of easily accessible music bertelsmann the german media giant cast its vote for a hybrid of the technology when it signed a deal with napster and embraced its creator sean fanning to turn napster into a for pay service but there is a second gamble in this plot this one belonging not to the record companies but to a number of technology companies they are vying to create a secure copyright management system that could be the backbone both of subscription services and for pay digital music business models like selling music for download on a per song basis record company executives say companies aspiring to create such technology which would encrypt music files and program them to expire are spilling out of the woodwork sensing a big opportunity but both record and technology companies are taking a big gamble they are betting that napster will either be shut down by the courts or unilaterally begin charging if neither happens and napster keeps growing all bets are off if napster stays free a lot of people will be doing a lot of rethinking an executive at one music technology company said matt richtel
