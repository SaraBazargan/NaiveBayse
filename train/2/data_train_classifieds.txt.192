 it was just a routine roll call said the generals reassuringly a showy late night deployment last week of nearly 100 tanks around the presidential palace inside indonesia 's top military men were saluting their commander in chief president abdurrahman wahid and respectfully declining to carry out his order to impose a state of emergency so that he could cling to office it was an act of insubordination that underscored the political power of the indonesian military but nobody seemed to mind suddenly one of the country 's most unpopular institutions was the hero of the day now a big surprise the military has become the darling of democracy said salim said an expert on the armed forces an interesting view indonesia 's military is the overmuscled giant in the room and it is used to having things its way it ran the country for 32 years under former president suharto not just security affairs but politics government the bureaucracy it was mr suharto 's instrument of repression and terror until his ouster three years ago now people want it out and it has promised to withdraw from politics so democracy really can flourish that promise will be tested now with the inauguration this week of a new president megawati sukarnoputri who is a friend of the military and does not share the reformist ideals of her predecessor mr wahid in the most dire prediction put forward by mr wahid himself she will become its puppet and military influence in indonesia will be more unchecked than ever military leaders robustly deny this saying that the military has learned its lesson and that it really wants to become a professional nonpolitical organization at the service of its civilian commander it has been our commitment to leave the political arena and we are preparing a new paradigm that is different from our behavior in the past said gen graito husodo the chief spokesman for the armed forces in an interview we know we must change we have no other choice but to change if we do n't change we die but he added a significant caveat it 's not about changing our culture overnight he said especially a culture that has been shaped over the past 32 years most independent analysts of the military here agree with this as a broad generalization but they too add a caveat saying there are many steps to be taken on the road to reform many differences over the pace and nature of change and many serious obstacles that will take years to address rather than seeing mrs megawati as a puppet these analysts say it might be more accurate to say there is a wide meeting of the minds with more of the actual thinking perhaps done by the soldiers there has been an implicit alliance between them for more than a year a western diplomat said there is little question that the military has been out to get wahid the new president is not seen as a stickler for civil liberties and she is expected to welcome the military 's eagerness to use aggressive tactics to quell separatist movements and other disturbances most political analysts do not expect her to press forward very hard with prosecutions of officers implicated in an array of human rights abuses like those committed in east timor when it gained its independence in 1999 she may be influenced by them but saying she will come under their domination is too strong said harold crouch an expert on the indonesian military with the international crisis group a policy institute she will probably allow them a freer hand in what they would see as their own field security matters whether the screws will be tightened to the point of reinstituting press restrictions harassing public interest groups and limiting political expression and whether such steps could be blamed on the military are questions raising concern among many indonesians today such possible steps might depend on the perception of the military and the power structure of the degree of threat they see to their control there is also an old guard within the military that is reluctant to cede the wealth and power that came with political dominance and that argues that civilians are not yet capable of running the country the ineptness of mr wahid 's administration only strengthened that argument i keep telling my friends that at the end of the day the important thing is not whether the military role is reduced but how to increase the civilian capacity for good leadership said juwono sudarsono a former defense minister whatever happens it would take some doing to go back to the pervasive military role of the past significant and possibly irreversible changes have already taken place the army 's roles in security and politics have been formally ended no longer is the military in charge of the political system and government bureaucracy no longer does it have the power to examine and reject party leaders and electoral candidates active officers can no longer populate the government power structure as they have for decades as provincial and local administrators government ministers and ambassadors and the formal inclusion of the armed forces as a voting bloc in the upper and lower houses of parliament has been reduced in number and is due to be phased out entirely in the next few years one of the stumbling blocks to reform is the maintenance of a structure that operates parallel to the civilian bureaucracy and often wields more power the military argues that the nation is still too unstable for it to pull its forces out of the provinces entirely more important the territorial commands provide as much as 70 percent of the military 's operating budget through legal and illegal businesses extortion rackets and control of logging and mining operations another issue is the lack of professionalism of many of the troops on the ground which top officers concede undertrained underpaid often poorly commanded local units sometimes run wild one more criminal element in an unstable society repairing the reputation of the military both at the level of national politics and in remote provinces may be as difficult a challenge as more substantive reforms but by challenging it with his threat to impose an emergency mr wahid may have given the military its biggest public relations lift in years
