 prominent national democrats now regard senator robert g torricelli of new jersey as their party 's most vulnerable senate incumbent prompting concern that his endangered seat might cost democrats control of the senate many democrats said they had expected mr torricelli to overcome his ethics troubles more easily instead his predicament has roiled the party and stirred resentment toward him among fellow democrats some of them say that mr torricelli 's wounds are self inflicted and that he opened himself to attack not to mention gave ammunition to his republican challenger douglas r forrester by engaging in behavior that led the senate ethics committee to reprimand him in july for improperly accepting gifts from a campaign donor echoing a sentiment that is widespread among party leaders in and out of congress terry mcauliffe the chairman of the democratic national committee said he now viewed mr torricelli as the most endangered democratic incumbent in the senate torricelli 's is the tightest mr mcauliffe said in an interview this week referring to mr torricelli 's race he 's dead even at best some democrats also say they are concerned that the party 's focus on new jersey threatens to limit the money and other resources that are available for other democrats in september alone the democratic senatorial campaign committee spent 21 million on three television advertisements promoting mr torricelli 's positions on crucial voting issues in new jersey including abortion rights environmental protection and gun safety democratic party officials say they intend to pump well over 5 million into helping mr torricelli defend his seat but mr mcauliffe and other party leaders also say that the interest generated by the torricelli race has helped draw more money than they expected bob is bringing millions of dollars in mr mcauliffe said if anything bob is creating excitement out there and helping raise more money the situation is a remarkable reversal of fortune for mr torricelli who is completing his first term in the senate after serving in the house as chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign committee in 2000 he helped bring the number of democrats in the senate to 50 the party gained its one vote advantage last year when senator james m jeffords of vermont left the republican party to become an independent but now some of the same senators mr torricelli helped are concerned that his troubles may send democrats back into the minority it 's come as a surprise to many of us that this race is as close as it is said senator charles e schumer democrat of new york this is now one of the two or three most important races for us as democrats because control of the senate could hinge on its outcome james carville the democratic consultant said the ethics committee report turned a noncompetitive race into a competitive race mr torricelli 's campaign manager ken snyder acknowledged that the senator faced a difficult challenge in june mr torricelli led mr forrester by 14 points now several independent political publications including the cook political report and the rothenberg report are rating the race as a tossup or leaning toward mr forrester the president of a company that manages pharmacy benefits but mr snyder said mr torricelli would prevail because of his rival 's opposition to abortion rights and gun control which he said would not go over well with new jersey voters mr snyder also criticized mr forrester 's stand on the environment in deference to mr torricelli many senators declined to criticize their colleague publicly a top senate democrat said the level of concern among mr torricelli 's colleagues was so deep that senate leaders had pulled mr torricelli aside to ask how he could have inflicted such damage on his own political prospects but mr torricelli did not provide a full explanation apart from acknowledging errors in judgment this democrat recalled mr torricelli 's supporters acknowledge that he brought his problems on himself but they add it is important for democrats not to lose sight of what is at stake in the november election continued democratic control of the senate senator joseph i lieberman democrat of connecticut agreed that the turn in mr torricelli 's position was surprising there are a significant number of races that are very competitive and could go either way mr lieberman said and so what you have to say now is that the new jersey race is one more race that becomes from what we read in the polls competitive but it 's one of many i mean this election is going to be extremely close the senate could go either way one person close to mr torricelli sought to wring some good out of the senator 's troubles saying that at least now the national party had his race on the election map it 's entirely possible that new jersey would have been overlooked and the resources would have come too late this person said fortunately the party became mobilized before labor day and will make the necessary effort to help torricelli win mr torricelli 's troubles involve an accusation that he improperly accepted thousands of dollars in unreported gifts and cash from a political supporter david chang mr torricelli did not deny taking gifts from mr chang but said he took no illegal gifts the justice department referred the case to the senate ethics committee after prosecutors closed their inquiry without indicting mr torricelli in july the ethics committee severely admonished him asserting that he had violated senate rules some democrats say the action taken by the ethics committee was so mild that they did not expect it to hurt mr torricelli 's re election campaign but republicans have seized on it and mr forrester has even called on mr torricelli to resign the senate ethics committee thought what they did was appropriate but no big deal said one prominent senate democrat and then to see it blow up like this there are so many other things that would have been more severe if the evidence had warranted it a letter of reprimand is really on the scale of what an ethics committee can do relatively minor
