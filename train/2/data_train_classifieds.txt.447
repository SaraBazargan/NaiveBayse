 ahmad chalabi an iraqi opposition leader favored by the pentagon says he has raised with president bush 's envoy to iraq his concern that the united states appears ready to admit senior officials from saddam hussein 's baath party in a transitional government here the talks came amid reports of tension between mr chalabi and the american military here when mr chalabi tried earlier this week to enter a political meeting organized by american officials it took an hour to find the right door his press secretary zaab sethna said mr chalabi waited 45 minutes in a line to get in then left his aides said american soldiers stripped some of mr chalabi 's militia of their weapons the contradictory messages appear to be part of the difficulty the americans are having in bringing order to the political vacuum that has followed the ouster of mr hussein the situation is complicated by continuing uncertainty about whether mr hussein is alive and whether his top aides many of whom have eluded capture are capable of mounting organized opposition to the american presence jay garner the retired united states lieutenant general appointed to head the transition office here has met with some director generals from mr hussein 's ministries who by definition had to be members of the baath party he said at a news conference several days ago that membership in the baath party would not in itself disqualify iraqis from retaining their administrative jobs but that close associates of mr hussein and known violators of human rights would be barred francis brooke political adviser to mr chalabi 's organization the iraqi national congress said the inc 's policy is amnesty for everyone except the very worst he said that mr chalabi had himself met with the director generals of several ministries and what he called people from the apparatus of power and said that the goal should be to destroy institutions not individuals citing east germany and its secret police stasi as an example but mr chalabi said in an interview that he had raised his concern about admitting baath figures with zalmay khalilzad mr bush 's representative to the iraqi opposition in talks on tuesday mr chalabi declined to name names but other representatives of the iraqi national congress said that the central intelligence agency had retained saad janabi as a key adviser the opposition members identified mr janabi as a former assistant to hussein kamel mr hussein 's son in law who oversaw weapons programs defected to jordan in 1995 and was killed by mr hussein 's government when he later returned to iraq a cia spokesman in washington said he had no comment on whether mr janabi was advising the agency several iraqis who were baath party members said in interviews this week that the party was attempting to regroup in baghdad and elsewhere in the country one former official in mukhabarat the deposed government 's secret police described spying on international weapons inspectors while serving as a member of the national monitoring directorate the iraqi agency that accompanied inspectors on their visits about one fourth of the directorate 's roughly 475 people worked for the security police the official said requesting anonymity because of his fear of baathist reprisals an american military official said today he feared that the recent attacks on american soldiers in baghdad was the work of isolated members of the baath party kanan makiya a professor who supports mr chalabi 's group said that some 300 iraqis who attended a meeting of iraqi leaders on monday overwhelmingly endorsed american efforts to de baathify iraq he said that mr chalabi and the five other opposition leaders elected last february at a conference in northern iraq would meet on thursday to discuss plans for the provisional or transitional government that mr chalabi has long advocated and washington recently endorsed a broader conference of iraqis is to be held in about a month with a view to choosing an iraqi administration a timetable speeded up after a series of meetings in washington concluded that that was desirable bush administration officials have said however it appears that officials in washington have not resolved what position if any mr chalabi should occupy mr chalabi has strong support from deputy defense secretary paul d wolfowitz and from the office of vice president dick cheney however the state department and other american officials have reservations mr chalabi has his own united states military liaison officer col ted seel a special forces officer who reports to central command mr sethna said he said that checkpoints manned by mr chalabi 's militia the free iraqi fighters who have been trained in part under colonel seel were coordinated with the americans but mudhar shawkat the no 2 person in the iraqi national congress said an american military unit on monday stopped his two car convoy disarmed his guards made them lie in the street and called them looters and criminals some seven members of mr chalabi 's fighters have been injured in clashes with americans and leaders of the iraqi national congress are aware of the americans arrest on sunday of baghdad 's self appointed mayor muhammad al zubeidi mr brooke said he was glad that mr chalabi had been able to meet mr khalilzad to try to resolve the tensions mr chalabi the scion of an extremely wealthy and politically prominent shiite family left baghdad in 1958 and returned this month he was in northern iraq for several years operating the major opposition group from the persian gulf war of 1991 until 1996 he has set up headquarters in the hunting club in the exclusive mansur district with his free iraqi fighters opposite in another club guarded by american humvees his wealth and his evident american backing have attracted a bevy of visitors from all walks of life but the level of his popular support or even recognition remains unclear in a society still largely without electricity radio television or newspapers
