 bosnia 's divided serbs croats and muslims voted for a new government today under western pressure to reject the nationalist parties that led this country into a brutal war in 1992 the international officials who have run bosnia as a virtual protectorate since the west forced a peace deal in 1995 are eager to scale back their presence here soon they are urging bosnians to vote for politicians committed to a multiethnic future who are deemed more capable of governing alone as a drip feed of more than 5 billion in foreign aid starts to dry up but two years to the day after the people of serbia toppled slobodan milosevic their ethnic kin in bosnia 's semiautonomous serb republic are expected to re elect a party founded by radovan karadzic their wartime leader who has been indicted on charges of genocide and is now on the run moderate parties stand a better chance in bosnia 's other half a federation of muslims and croats which also has a separate parliament in addition to the joint state assembly but the electoral prospects of these parties have been hit by the collapse of an unwieldy coalition that took power after the last general election in 2000 and by its failure to deliver social and economic improvements in one of europe 's poorest countries polls indicate that the biggest party in the departing government has nonetheless maintained its lead over more nationalist muslim and croat parties although if it is to regain power it will need support from several of the bewildering array of 57 parties on the ballot the big question in this election is whether it will be possible to form new non nationalist coalitions afterward said mark wheeler an analyst with the international crisis group a research group regardless of who wins sweeping constitutional changes imposed by the west will require all ethnic groups to share power at every level of bosnia 's multiple layers of government a legacy of the dayton peace accords which split the country down wartime front lines every elected office in the country bar those on municipal authorities is up for grabs today the first election that international officials have allowed bosnians to run for themselves since the war preliminary results are expected on monday but it could take weeks to learn who forms the next government the top jobs seats in bosnia 's three way joint presidency are likely to be taken by people with strong supporters and opponents serbs and croats some of whom still harbor hopes of joining their land to neighboring serbia and croatia are expected to elect nationalists the probable muslim winner haris silajdzic was prime minister during the war and is widely disliked by other groups for demanding the unification of bosnia 's two halves that prospect remains unthinkable at the moment but although bosnia remains dysfunctional the return of many refugees to their pre war homes has begun the sustainability of this progress after more than 200000 people were killed will depend not only on ordinary people but on whether the leaders they elect have vision to make bosnia a viable country for the first time since the guns fell silent officials will be elected for four years rather than two in the hope that they will knuckle down and jump start the economy but power in this country of 35 million people remains in the hands of a foreigner for now although paddy ashdown a british politician is likely to be the last international high representative here urging bosnians to eschew crooks and opportunists mr ashdown said the alternative was a country crippled by debt shunned by investors abandoned by the young undermined by corruption and condemned to a seemingly unending international oversight
