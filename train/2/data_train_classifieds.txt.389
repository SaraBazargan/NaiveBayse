 in 2001 the publisher simon schuster signed a 500000 contract with michael pellegrino a las vegas resident who claimed to be the illegitimate grandson of the late mafia boss carlo gambino in return mr pellegrino using the pseudonym michael gambino delivered a novel called the honored society which pocket books a division of simon schuster published last november the book was marketed as the work of the highest ranking mob member ever to record the innermost workings of the mafia but now simon schuster contends mr pellegrino is not who he says he is the publisher has sued both the author and the agency that represented him saying they committed fraud by giving him a far darker criminal history than he actually had simon schuster filed the suit in federal district court in manhattan in february but not until this week four days after the publisher took the unusual step of filing a second federal fraud suit against the agency artists management group the los angeles talent company founded by michael ovitz did the publisher disclose publicly that it believed that it had been deceived mr pellegrino 's lawyer contends pocket books owes his client the last 100000 of his book advance and has countersued to receive it the lawyer leon friedman said last night that mr pellegrino had fulfilled his contract by writing the book he had promised nothing in the contract made reference to mr pellegrino 's biographical claims the lawyer said another lawyer for mr pellegrino gus flangas of las vegas said that mr pellegrino does believe he is the illegitimate grandson of carlo gambino as he has been told since childhood mr friedman questioned why the author 's biography should matter anyway why do you publish a book he said because it 's got literary quality or because we can advertise this as the grandson of carlo gambino what 's important in publishing these days a spokeswoman for mr pellegrino 's agent joel gotler said he would not comment on pending litigation simon schuster 's lawsuit against the agency was reported in the new york post yesterday according to adam rothberg the spokesman for simon schuster questions about michael gambino and his authenticity surfaced after publication of the honored society by pocket books he would not say who raised the questions over the course of time neither gambino nor his agent were able to provide us with satisfactory proof of his bona fides mr rothberg said some time after publication of the book mr rothberg said it was withdrawn the online bookseller amazoncom lists the honored society as out of print mr rothberg did not comment on the extent to which the publisher checked mr pellegrino 's contentions criminal records in clark county nev show that the author was sentenced to a minimum of 19 months in prison in november 1999 on felony theft charges mr flangas his lawyer said the charges involved the misappropriation of a 2400 rental deposit as part of its marketing campaign simon schuster arranged for michael gambino to be interviewed on abc 's good morning america in december during the interview the author told charles gibson that writing the roman a clef helps me cleanse my soul mr gibson described his guest as a member of the most powerful crime family in new york lisa finkel a spokeswoman for good morning america said that abc learned of the publisher 's doubts only on tuesday we were pitched this book from a reputable publisher with whom we regularly do business and reported on it in good faith she said in a statement yesterday we learned only yesterday that the publisher now believes that the author is a fraud and we started looking into the story as soon as we learned about the lawsuit we plan to follow up on the story as soon as we have all the facts judith m curr the president of pocket books is vacationing in sydney australia near her hometown she did not respond to two messages left on her phone there asked why simon schuster had taken the unusual step of suing the talent agency mr rothberg the simon schuster spokesman said this is an extraordinary step but we felt we had no other recourse he added for us the larger issue here is that we do hundreds or thousands of deals a year with agencies we need to be able to rely on them to bring us authors and literary properties that are authentic and as billed without that reliability the whole relationship of the whole business collapses the lawsuit against the agency contends that it contacted simon schuster a division of viacom telling the publisher that mr pellegrino was a crime boss of one of the most respected and feared crime families in the world and that he had served 12 years in a federal penitentiary claims repeated in publicity releases according to mr flangas the nevada lawyer for mr pellegrino his client had been charged in two separate state cases more than three years ago pleading guilty to the theft charges the question of how much to trust an author and how much to check any contentions perennially bedevils publishers it has been a rough year for simon schuster in another area one of its authors doris kearns goodwin has been under fire for inappropriately copying passages in a book she wrote in 1987 another simon schuster historian stephen e ambrose acknowledged in january that he had inadvertently copied sentences and phrases in his best selling book the wild blue from another historian 's earlier work
