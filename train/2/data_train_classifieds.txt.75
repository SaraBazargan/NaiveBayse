 electronic music has always been a paradox of sorts though the dj 's who produce it love digital technology they continue to rely for their source material on what many consider an archaic item the analog vinyl record digital files have obvious advantages they do n't scratch or skip they 're virtually weightless and they 're easy to distribute and share and over the past decade many machines have appeared on the market that allow dj 's to manipulate sound digitally but digital interfaces ignore the physical facts of dj'ing the comfortable feel of a record moving back and forth under a dj 's hand the responsiveness of vinyl and the spatial and visual clues dj 's use to remember and find tracks and beats finalscratch is an attempt to solve the dj 's quandary the mixing system developed this year by a group of hackers in the netherlands is the first invention that allows dj 's to use their preferred analog materials two turntables a mixer and a vinyl record to manipulate digital music files a 12 inch vinyl disc known as the finalscratch record is encoded with digital signals instead of a song when it is played on a normal turntable it functions something like a computer modem sending information instead of music through the stylus finalscratch then uses that information to manipulate a digitally stored piece of music when the dj manually speeds up or slows down the turntable or scratches the vinyl the digital music file is instantly altered in exactly the same way a real record would be it is a marriage of high and low technology 21st century digital music tweaked and massaged by the dj 's old fashioned hand margie borschke
