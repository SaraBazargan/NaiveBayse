 not so very long ago tony sanchez was just a fabulously wealthy businessman known in texas business and political circles but unknown to the voting public he fancied his thin mustache and wore aviator styled glasses he was supposedly a democrat but he also gave generously to george w bush the mustache is now gone and the glasses have been replaced by a more staid wire rimmed pair also gone is 538 million from mr sanchez 's fortune spent on a barrage of advertising as the democratic nominee for mr bush 's old job as governor if texas hardly knew tony sanchez before the state can not escape him now what do you say to those who say you are trying to buy the election a houston television anchor jerome gray asked mr sanchez on wednesday night in the candidates first debate televised across texas i 've had to do in a few months eight months what he has done in 17 years mr sanchez answered noting that his opponent gov rick perry is well known from a long tenure in politics mr sanchez who has never before run for office added i 've had to try to catch up in what has become one of the nastiest and most expensive governor 's races in the nation mr sanchez 59 by dint of his wallet and his presumed ethnic appeal is making republicans work hard to hold the office that vaulted mr bush to the presidency the advantages in republican leaning texas remain with mr perry the former lieutenant governor who inherited the top job from mr bush but polls suggest mr sanchez is gaining for the democrats who lost every statewide office in mr bush 's tenure the sanchez candidacy smacks of both inspiration and desperation democrats hope that mr sanchez 's spending will invigorate their ticket and that his mexican american heritage will attract a record turnout among the fast growing hispanic population if he wins mr sanchez would become the state 's first modern day hispanic governor he has been closing the gap day by day said molly beth malcolm chairwoman of the state democratic party a survey usa statewide tracking poll found that mr perry 's lead fell from 16 percentage points on july 12 to 7 points last week the sanchez campaign has released a poll showing the difference at 3 points while perry aides say the margin is safely in double digits the dynamics of the raceseem turned upside down it is the democrat mr sanchez who is running a big spending campaign as an outsider and a businessman criticizing mr perry as a career politician beholden to lobbyists and industry it is the republican mr perry who boasts of long experience as an elected official in the debate mr perry repeated the word experience so many times that scattered snickers rose from the audience but the biggest difference by far is the money republicans usually outspend democrats in texas in statewide races in 1998 governor bush outspent his democratic opponent about 17 to 1 in cruising to re election including about 3 million in contributions from others mr sanchez spent 575 million through sept 26 the deadline for the latest filing period compared with 163 million for mr perry as a result mr sanchez by himself has already broken the state 's spending record of 534 million for the governor 's campaign set by the combined campaigns of seven candidates in 1990 he is now spending roughly 1 million a week on television advertisements his campaign estimates that the average texas television viewer sees a sanchez commercial 8 to 10 times a week no small feat in a state with 18 television markets and nearly 21 million people it 's like nothing we 've ever experienced said susan weddington chairwoman of the texas republican party who accused the sanchez campaign of essentially co opting the democratic party just money everywhere trying to buy everything over all democrats are relishing this taste of affluence and say they believe the money can help them in other statewide races but some party members say the sanchez campaign despite its spending and television campaign has not yet energized its base hispanic vote hispanics represent more than a third of the state 's population but traditionally vote in far lower numbers one hispanic state legislator who spoke on condition of not being identified by name said mr sanchez was taking hispanic support for granted he is assuming that hispanics will vote for the hispanic and that is a good assumption if they vote at all said the legislator who is a democrat but since they do n't vote at all unless they are asked that 's his challenge he 's got to ask and he has n't asked yet mr sanchez a seventh generation texan from laredo who traces his lineage to mexico and spain is running as a business oriented moderate an oilman and banker mr sanchez is estimated to be worth 600 million and his campaign initially assumed that his business background would be a plus in texas but the collapse of the enron corporation and the attention on corporate malfeasance have undercut any advantage of campaigning as a chief executive mr perry has also pounded at a 1980 's scandal in which a savings and loan controlled by mr sanchez and his family accepted 25 million in cash from mexican men later identified as drug dealers ultimately the savings and loan failed costing taxpayers 161 million in a federal bailout in the debate mr sanchez noted that his bank was cleared of any wrongdoing involving the drug money and said that the institution 's overall failure came as more than 2500 savings and loan were also collapsing in texas mr perry also attacked mr sanchez over the fact that he did not vote in the last governor 's election mr sanchez conceded that that was a mistake throughout the debate mr sanchez repeated his main point that mr perry had done too little to address a home insurance crisis in the state hundreds of thousands of homeowners in texas which leads the nation in the cost of home insurance premiums are expected to lose their coverage in the next year and premiums will increase for many others mr sanchez said mr perry should have called a special legislative session to address the issue and accused him of failing to act because he has more than 1 million in campaign contributions from insurers mr bush has campaigned with mr perry but mr sanchez who contributed more than 300000 to mr bush 's campaigns has run commercials noting his own ties to the president the election is acutely important to both parties republicans would be horrified if they lost mr bush 's old job democrats have focused on this election cycle for two years and assembled a ticket that includes former mayor ron kirk of dallas who is black as their senate nominee party leaders hope that the slate 's moderate positions will help attract anglo voters and that mr sanchez and mr kirk will bring out a record minority vote if he wins mr sanchez 's campaign manager glenn smith said of his candidate it returns texas to a true two party state
