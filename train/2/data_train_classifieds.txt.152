 as it races to finish its 858 million expansion and renovation the museum of modern art has also been acquiring close to 40 million worth of paintings drawings and sculpture hoping to reopen in a year with an even richer permanent collection than before most prominent among the acquisitions is diver a drawing by jasper johns that is widely considered to be one of the most important works on paper of the 20th century the museum said it had also bought several other seminal works by modern masters like picasso and francis bacon these are a landmark series of acquisitions said glenn d lowry director of the museum most institutions would be thrilled to own just one of these works institutions like the whitney museum of american art and the san francisco museum of modern art have made substantially larger acquisitions over the last few years but their collections were not strong to begin with the modern 's recent purchases are substantial additions to what is already a world class collection to raise some of the money for these purchases the modern sold several artworks from its collection among them a rare 1909 cubist landscape by picasso that many experts say the museum should never have parted with officials at the modern however say they have another better picasso of the same period adding diver to the collection was something of a coup for the modern it is the most profound and intense work of art that johns has created in any medium said john elderfield the modern 's chief curator of painting and sculpture created in 1962 63 it is an unusually large drawing nearly 7 feet tall and 6 feet wide experts say it is worth well over 10 million drawn on brown paper with charcoal chalk pastel and probably watercolor the work abstractly suggests a diver in motion showing two sets of hands one touching and pointing down as though preparing to dive and the other coming back up as if the figure were rising its theme is similar to this artist 's 1963 painting periscope to hart crane both works refer to crane 's 1932 suicide by drowning diver was begun before mr johns created a painting by the same name although the drawing was not finished until afterward johns began it as a study for the painting mr elderfield said it ended up being a major picture in its own right although it is a work on paper diver will hang with mr johns 's paintings because it is considered to be of comparable scale and ambition diver had belonged to the prominent manhattan collectors victor and sally ganz who had bought it shortly after it was made from leo castelli mr johns 's dealer then mr ganz who died in 1987 was in the costume jewelry business and his wife who died in 1997 was a benefactor of educational and cultural organizations the year mrs ganz died her four children sold much of their parents collection at a christie 's auction in new york the sale brought 206 million making it the largest single owner auction in history but two of the ganz children kate and tony were so attached to diver that they kept it the two owned it jointly trading the drawing back and forth every two years it had been in the family for over 40 years kate ganz said we thought the time had come for it to be shared with others tony ganz added that owning diver was a privilege and it was our inherited responsibility to see that it went to the modern their mother had been close to kirk varnedoe the modern 's chief curator of painting and sculpture mr ganz said so the two children gave a portion of the painting to the modern in memory both of varnedoe who died in august and of their parents the museum bought the rest for an undisclosed sum with the addition of diver the museum now owns one of the world 's most comprehensive group of works by mr johns including 10 paintings 16 drawings a sculpture and more than 250 prints the modern has also added to its collection a seminal bacon triptych the painting the last major work before bacon 's death in 1992 was sold to the museum by the artist 's estate the triptych 's three panels with strangely distorted figures are derived from photographs taken by eadweard muybridge an early modern photographer known for his action figures over these are a portrait of the artist and a portrait of the brazilian race car driver ayrton senna the work has been interpreted as reflecting the struggle between the man of action and the man as artist we have much strength in early bacon but we have not been fortunate enough to cover his entire career mr lowry said missing was a monumental triptych we kept hammering away at the estate till they were ready to release this one both the bacon and the johns were works the museum spent years trying to get two sculptures that have been added to the collection came on the market only recently one is picasso 's pregnant woman 1950 which was shown at the gagosian gallery in manhattan in an exhibition of picasso sculptures this spring it was being sold by maya picasso the daughter of the artist and marie therese walter inspired by picasso 's companion francoise gilot who was pregnant with their daughter paloma the work is unique because it is fashioned from plaster rather than bronze it 's actually an assemblage mr elderfield said the breasts stomach and one of the arms are made from shards of broken pottery which picasso found in a garbage heap when i saw it i thought it looked like something that had been dug up from the earth and was thousands of years old at an auction of works from the estate of sophie taeuber arp wife of the modernist sculptor jean arp which was held in paris in june the modern bought taeuber arp 's dada head from 1920 the museum paid about 12 million for the sculpture which is a small abstract painted wood head it joins two paintings a drawing and six prints by taeuber arp already in the modern 's collection while the impetus for these purchases is the reopening of the museum on west 53rd street in manhattan the modern plans to show some of the acquisitions in early february in its temporary home in long island city queens by then there may be more acquisitions but referring to diver mr lowry said there will probably be nothing on this scale
