 at bottom president bush 's speech on tuesday reflects the belief that the current corporate scandals are merely the handiwork of a few bad apples if we enforce existing laws more strongly he essentially told us the mess will be cleaned up he called for longer prison sentences and a federal swat team to combat fraud is such law enforcement talk what he thinks americans understand any new rules or regulations will be left to self regulators like stock exchanges there is no need for direct government oversight of accounting but something more systemic than a few clever swindlers is staining america it is hard to believe that mr bush 's economic advisers do n't know that the enron deceptions alone involved some of the nation 's most prestigious accountants lawyers wall street brokers and commercial bankers along with some of enron 's own highly respected directors about 1000 corporations have had to restate earnings the last five years a good economist 's first instinct would be to determine whether there are incentives built into the financial system that encourage deception and fraud a president who wanted to make business trustworthy again and renew the nation 's confidence would address these incentives directly it 's helpful to return for perspective to the corporate scandals of the 1980 's and 1990 's the best piece of economic analysis on the subject was done by george a akerlof of the university of california at berkeley later a nobel prize winner and paul m romer now of the stanford business school in the brookings papers on economic activity the two developed a model that showed fairly convincingly that it was rational for executives to loot their companies when accounting standards were lax their most compelling examples were the savings and loan bankruptcies of the 1980 's accounting rules were changed and existing standards relaxed to aid the s l 's after high interest rates devastated them in the late 1970 's but permissive accounting coupled with federal guarantees of deposits ultimately enabled executives to make highly risky investments to inflate short term profits they could pay themselves enormous compensation because the accounting methods did not properly reflect the risks or costs until years later the incentives encouraged them to make investments that mr akerlof and mr romer wrote could have had no reasonable payoff in any future state of the world this is sadly familiar enron inflated profits through highly devious accounting it made many bad investments whose long run risks could be hidden but that could produce rapid if temporary profits worldcom and other telecommunications companies made similarly risky investments building capacity aggressively even when there was no sign of demand but the executives were still able to enrich themselves the widespread granting of stock options created similar incentives with damaging consequences the prevailing worry famously raised by adolf berle and gardiner means in the 1930 's had been that managers would run companies to preserve their jobs rather than to maximize profits now the problem had purportedly been solved options allowed them to buy large quantities of their companies shares at low prices managers who received options it was argued would act entrepreneurially because they would be compensated as owners would be but options it turned out encouraged managers to take unduly big risks as long as they showed handsome short term profits they became rich if investments paid off but they did not lose money if they failed and they could usually bail out long before the investments went bad they also managed earnings to appeal to wall street 's short term orientation nothing was quite so ludicrous as when investors clobbered a stock because earnings per share were a penny or two below expectations now we know that billions of dollars of profits were simply fabricated true reform must correct such distorting incentives and if we are honest it should involve new regulation the stakes are high it is not just a matter of a few executives stealing a hundred million here or there perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars of national savings were misallocated to businesses that did not last rather than invested in businesses that might have created long term profits and permanent jobs the holdings of pension funds endowments and individuals have collapsed here is a start first every effort must be made to make sure accounting rules are tough and are adhered to industry on its own has not been up to this task accounting rules have been consistently watered down the last 10 years government should be involved in setting the rules a bill working through the senate sponsored by paul s sarbanes democrat of maryland is worth consideration second the ultimate authority over the annual audit of accounting practices should be held by special committees of corporate boards completely separate from chief executives and their staff third options should be deducted from current earnings so shareholders know what they are paying now there is no required deduction mr bush has said nothing about expensing options but even the federal reserve chairman alan greenspan supports such a reform more jail time for fraud as the president recommends may help but it will hardly be enough finding executives guilty swat team or not will continue to be difficult enron and worldcom executives will cite in their defense the opinions of accountants and lawyers who assured them usually in writing that what they were doing was not deceptive or illegal mr bush apparently can not or will not see that these deceptive and greedy executives operated in an environment that not merely tolerated their actions but encouraged them it is not just the bad apples that need to be expunged distorting incentives must be changed until that is acknowledged confidence will not be restored economic scene jeff madrick who
