 treasury secretary john w snow and his chinese counterparts agreed today that china should eventually allow its currency to trade freely on international markets but beijing rejected calls to move quickly in that direction saying it might cause financial instability in china and abroad mr snow faces political pressure to push china to raise the value of its currency the yuan some democratic presidential candidates and industry groups have argued that china keeps the currency deliberately undervalued to promote exports to america which they say has caused job losses in the united states last year china had the largest trade surplus with the united states of any country 103 billion though it runs a modest global trade surplus mr snow left china today after a two day visit without a specific timetable for addressing the currency issue but he said chinese officials assured him that they would take interim steps to loosen restrictions on the country 's tightly controlled financial system on the currency issue in particular i was encouraged to hear a reaffirmation of china 's longstanding goal to move toward greater flexibility mr snow said i was assured that interim policy steps are now being taken and progress in this area will continue china 's central bank governor zhou xiaochuan struck a conciliatory tone with mr snow in lengthy comments released by state media he promised that the value of the yuan would eventually be determined by market forces rather than being fixed at 83 to the dollar as it has been for almost a decade mr zhou also outlined a variety of measures that he said would allow the market to play a bigger role in china 's financial system among them are new regulations to allow foreigners to invest in yuan denominated securities and corresponding rules that allow some domestic investors to buy securities abroad mr snow said the discussion also included ways to make it easier for chinese individuals and companies to buy american stocks and bonds helping to recycle some of china 's export earnings into american investments mr zhou said china planned to encourage companies to invest more overseas exporters will also soon be allowed to keep more of the foreign currency they earn which could prompt them to import more goods beijing also announced new rules on the amount of foreign currency chinese tourists and business executives can take on trips abroad finally mr zhou also said for the first time that china would consider revising the pegged currency system to link the yuan to other currencies as well as the dollar because the dollar has declined against many other currencies this year any such move to link the yuan to a broader basket of currencies could prompt at least a modest rise in the value of the yuan against the dollar chinese state media have trumpeted the decision to stick by the currency system at least for now as a sign that the government can resist what one newspaper called international browbeating if implemented fully the steps mr zhou outlined would amount to a concerted attempt to respond to record inflows of foreign currency to china without remaking the currency system some measures have been under consideration for weeks or months but the fact that they were highlighted during mr snow 's visit represented a clear effort to address american complaints and channel some of china 's recent financial gains into overseas markets analysts said china authorities are sensitive to the politics of this issue in the united states and want to be viewed as responding andy xie chief asia economist of morgan stanley said
