 can new yorkers be bribed to behave our first experiment ended in failure as reported in this space last week handing out 20 bills in riverside park to people with their dogs on a leash seemed to have no effect on the rate of compliance with the leash law they were not even moved by the big city civility award certificates that accompanied the cash duly humbled i lowered my sights to another law the pooper scooper ordinance armed with more cash and congratulatory certificates i put on my referee shirt once again and staked out the block of 90th street between amsterdam and columbus my survey of the neighborhood showed that the block had the highest concentration of pooper scooper violations per square meter during two mornings and evenings i handed out 5 bills to dog owners who cleaned up after their animals once they and the block 's residents got an explanation for my uniform ref or foot locker one man asked they generally applauded the civility campaign unlike the dog owners in the park who defended the informal tradition of ignoring the leash law between 9 pm and 9 am no one claimed any exemption from the pooper scooper law it 's disgusting not to clean up after your dog but people around here do it all the time said the owner of rocky a pit bull mix when i see it happen i want to say something but the kind of people who do n't clean up are n't the kind of people you want to tell to clean up in new york you got to choose your battles i 'm not going down over this one over the course of a week i gave out 50 in awards and this time the labors did not seem in vain the incidence of violations as measured by inspections of the pavement at 8 30 am declined after a week to 14 from 29 dog owners it seemed would clean up for 5 even though they would n't leash their animals for 20 are there any lessons here in regulating new yorkers behavior i reported the data to peter van doren the editor of regulation a professional journal published by the cato institute he said the results jibed with a large body of research into the problems of regulating public lands even when you 're dealing with public property you have to consider people 's implicit notions of property rights dr van doren said dog owners recognize that they do n't have the right to leave poop on the sidewalk but they think they 're entitled to unleash their dogs in the early morning hours in the park so it will take a lot more than 20 to change that behavior it 's the same problem you face in preventing environmental damage to public lands in the west from ranchers and snowmobilers they demand generous compensation for giving up what they see as their right suppose then that the city or a community group started an awards program just for behavior that enjoyed widespread support like cleaning up after your dog how much should the award be giving out 5 awards regularly on every block would be expensive and possibly counterproductive because people might start expecting to be paid for not polluting society ca n't afford to pay you for everything you 're supposed to do dr van doren said our culture depends on people doing many things out of altruism and altruistic people become upset when whey see other people accepting payment for what they 're already doing for free there 's been a long running debate over the effects of paying people to give blood free market types think it increases the overall supply but liberals worry that it undermines the efforts by the red cross to recruit volunteers even liberals though seem comfortable with a subtle form of payment for altruism charity raffles which offer a few random awards to encourage public spirited behavior there could be similar awards given out randomly for civil behavior on the street a referee might take a walk once a month say and hand out a 500 award to the first dog owner observed following the pooper scooper law the odds of winning would be so long that no dog owner would expect to be paid but the prospect of getting lucky might induce some owners to be more diligent especially the type who drive to connecticut for powerball lottery tickets this approach might well be less expensive than trying to catch violators in the act and it would certainly be more pleasant to administer not that i 'm volunteering for the job i 've seen enough dog waste it 's time to hang up the referee shirt and let others carry on
