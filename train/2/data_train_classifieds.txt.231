 the good news about the holiday travel season is that in some sense the worst is already over the sunday after thanksgiving traditionally the busiest day of the year for air travel has passed without notable delays or disruptions thanks in part to good weather but even though travel is spread over a longer period in late december flying at christmas presents a different challenge dealing with all the baggage that passengers check drag through security and cram into overhead compartments a daunting task for both the government and the airlines in keeping with the holiday spirit security officials and airline representatives have been acting a bit like bickering relatives when it comes to assigning blame for problems at the airport even before the busy season actually began we feel that there will almost certainly be delays caused by security lines said diana cronan a spokeswoman for the air transport association of america the trade group for united states airlines by telephone a week before thanksgiving brian turmail a spokesman for the federal transportation security administration responded that 's interesting because the average traveler reports they spend twice as long waiting to get their boarding pass as they do to go through security he was referring to a survey of passengers conducted by the department of transportation last august as it turned out some of the longest lines observed at the airport over the thanksgiving weekend were at coffee retailers according to a survey conducted by travelocity one undercurrent for the tension is the fact that the government and the airlines have yet to work out who is responsible for the nearly 12000 claims that have been submitted by passengers reporting problems with checked bags such as missing items since the security administration began screening luggage for explosives a year ago since then the agency has advised travelers to leave bags unlocked in case they need to be searched raising the still unresolved question of who is liable for missing or damaged contents caught in the middle roberta dibartolomeo is one of the passengers caught in the middle of that negotiation she is still waiting for a response to a claim she and her husband filed in january reporting items missing from their luggage after a flight last dec 25 although they were ultimately reimbursed through their homeowner 's insurance she said the lack of a response from the security administration was disheartening we went through the whole process and wrote them a letter she said somebody from that office should have responded mr turmail said her claim was most likely held up by the ongoing negotiations with the airlines mark hatfield another administration spokesman said that a system to acknowledge baggage complaints has since been created so where does that leave travelers with piles of presents sweaters and winter sports equipment ms dibartolomeo 's advice make sure you have really good insurance is probably a good place to start even when an airline does take responsibility for lost luggage its liability is limited to 2500 a passenger on domestic flights and 907 a pound on international flights about 640 for each piece of baggage and most airlines stipulate that they are not liable for electronic equipment jewelry and other valuables one bright spot this year is that travelers can now buy luggage locks that meet guidelines approved by the transportation security administration screeners can open the locks if necessary the first locks to meet those standards using a system developed by a company called travel sentry have gone on sale at a variety of retailers 20 for a pair of the larger locks sold by brookstone other manufacturers and retailers expect to have more products to meet the standards before the holidays but if you are traveling with expensive presents a better option may be to ship them separately through the delivery services that usually help out santa there are also a handful of companies that specialize in delivering luggage an option i tried for a trip to my parents house for thanksgiving with mixed feelings about the results i had to wait around the house for them to show up although they did appear within the time window they promised and if i did n't work at home i would have had to take the bag to work since they generally pick up only during business hours surprisingly costly i was surprised how expensive these services are the price quoted by sports express at its web site sportsexpresscom to ship a small suitcase weighing 20 pounds was 5261 one way plus 15 for additional insurance the company includes 500 worth of insurance for each order extra insurance costs 1 for each 100 in declared value and i had to send my bag overnight on a friday for monday arrival sports express and its competitors typically arrange deliveries through companies like federal express and united parcel service so generally they do not pick up or deliver items on saturday or sunday the fact that several airlines have partnered with sports express boosted my confidence and its online booking process was very thorough i arranged the whole delivery without picking up the phone it was only after i submitted my credit card number that i was told the price quote was an estimate and the final price would be determined by the actual weight of the bag when it was picked up but the bag was delivered by midday monday as promised and my visa was charged the original price quoted 6761 my take using a luggage delivery service may be worthwhile for skis or golf clubs or if you can place the cost on an expense account but for most recreational trips paying upward of 60 each way to ship a bag does n't buy enough convenience for bags you do take to the airport the transportation security administration recommends leaving presents unwrapped since they may have to be opened for inspection and that undeveloped film be packed in a carry on bag since it can be damaged by screening equipment this year a growing number of airlines are also encouraging passengers to check in online american delta northwest united continental us airways alaska and america west allow customers traveling on domestic e tickets and on some international routes to check in and print out a boarding pass at their web sites typically 90 minutes to 24 hours ahead but even if you follow all the travel advice dispensed during the holidays you may still encounter hiccups for my thanksgiving trip i sent one bag ahead bought new locks that can be opened by screeners for my carry on and logged on to my computer around midnight to check in for a 9 am flight the computer told me that the first leg was delayed meaning i would miss my connection which led to a scramble for a 6 am flight but at least by checking in online i had time to change my plans when i asked the agent if the airline would have called to tell me about the delay he said at this hour probably not practical traveler susan stellin writes regularly for the travel section
