 as democratic chief of staff on the senate finance committee lawrence o'donnell jr spent a lot of time sitting through important congressional meetings but his agenda was a bit different from everyone else 's i would take two different kinds of notes mr o'donnell said one set related to the policy we were working on in the room and the other was about the atmospherics that were going on i always knew i 'd be leaving government someday i just did n't know when there was something about knowing that it was temporary that left me in writerly observational mode the first set of notes came in handy while mr o'donnell held the finance post from 1993 to 1995 the second set though continues to pay dividends as mr o'donnell channels the information into mister sterling which had its premiere this month the new nbc series centers on the trials and tribulations of an idealistic young lawyer josh brolin who also happens to be the son of william sterling a popular ex governor of california played by james whitmore when one of the state 's senators dies suddenly the younger mr sterling is unexpectedly given the temporary appointment to take his place the series may be a modern more issue oriented version of mr smith goes to washington but mr o'donnell who first began writing the show in 1992 and is one of its executive producers says it 's not strictly about politics this is a show in which the lead character 's first statement about politics is 'i hate politics he said right there we 're welcoming in viewers who do n't like politics this show is n't c span it 's about human drama and conflict we wo n't stay locked in congressional offices nbc executives also maintain that even though this is the network 's second show involving politicians mister sterling has very little in common with the west wing the emmy award winning series on which mr o'donnell previously worked as a writer and producer we felt like our schedule can support two shows like this said karey burke executive vice president for development of prime time series at nbc after all you can have different kinds of cop shows and different kinds of doctor shows why not different kinds of politician shows and mister sterling certainly tries to make its title character different rather than be a dyed in the wool democrat a la president bartlet on west wing mr sterling is a devout independent he supports oil drilling in alaska but also wants money to hire teachers for inmates he hops from one side of the fence to another depending on the issue something that mr o'donnell and the network hope will more accurately reflect how most americans and their elected officials really think the truth is even people who work within the parties are much more independent in private thinking than their public postures indicate mr o'donnell said they all have a list of things they dislike about what their parties are doing and that includes mr brolin the son of the actor james brolin and stepson of the decidedly democratic barbra streisand mr brolin was initially reluctant to take the role of mr sterling because he feared the show would be too partisan after meeting with mr o'donnell though he quickly changed his mind i was the kid with the mohawk growing up i was n't alec baldwin he said i do n't care about politics i vote and get involved when i need to i do it personally i would n't hire me to play a senator because i 'm not typical but lawrence wanted somebody who goes against the grain the notion of a truly independent united states senator let alone one with mr brolin 's movie star good looks is certainly not indicative of what americans have come to expect from their congressional representatives i do n't know if 'the west wing is really like the way politics is in this country but this show is fiction and can be idealistic mr brolin said but he added what you see on the show is not not possible it 's that fantasy element that really hooked the network it 's the same thing we saw with 'er ms burke said those were the doctors you wished could treat you with 'mister sterling these characters are the people we wish had these jobs in washington in real life but mr o'donnell though admitting to moments in every episode when he 'd think gee i 'd like to see things done this way in real life considers the series a pretty realistic depiction of the limits of power i 'm not trying to teach any lessons he said that might happen and i 'd be open to the possibility that people will say 'oh he 's trying to say this about that policy but that 's not what 's consciously driving my writing mr o'donnell does not think of mister sterling as particularly democratic or liberal he prefers to use another term activist i think this would be a little problematic dramatically if you tried to make a show about a conservative and the republicans would probably agree he said they want to do less in government and that 's a trickier thing to go at in drama how does a scene work when your character is the guy who does n't want to do something it 's a trickier thing trying to find the drama in that so for a tv show being activist is a good thing political correctness does n't hurt either the part of mr sterling 's chief of staff was n't written for an african american woman and at first that 's what kept audra mcdonald from auditioning for it i was protecting myself from disappointment said ms mcdonald who is best known for her award winning broadway performances i thought it was a great script but figured they 'd never cast me because i 'm black but everyone there really pushed for me because the thinking is very open minded for a tv show while mr o'donnell and the network do n't want to push politics too hard ms mcdonald said she was confident that audiences would be getting a civics lesson i hope we have an effect on people she said i 'd like this show to advance really good ideas and make people more aware of their own voice that 's certainly not out of the realm of possibility according to ms burke after 'er went on the air i heard that medical school enrollment started going up she said cover story craig tomashoff is a television critic
