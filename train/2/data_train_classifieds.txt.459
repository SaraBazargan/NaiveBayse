 nicholas e calio 's chauffeur driven black chrysler was pulling into the white house gates last week back from mr calio 's third trip that day to capitol hill where the bush administration 's proposed trade bill had run into trouble trade bills are notoriously difficult said mr calio the very wired white house congressional liaison whose job is to round up the votes to turn one of president bush 's top legislative priorities into law so he hates trade bills i love them mr calio responded because they 're fun everything 's a problem last week as the white house fought back a storm of criticism that it had missed clues to the sept 11 attacks another battle was under way on capitol hill mr bush 's bill giving the president the right to make trade deals that congress ca n't revise once called fast track now trade promotion authority came under daily assault the legislation had squeaked through the republican controlled house in december and the trend in the democratic controlled senate which was not in the mood to do the president any favors did not bode well by thursday so many senators had offered so many amendments that the white house lost track then it was forced to devote its energies to defeating what it considered the poison pill amendments that would turn off so many senators that the bill could go down mr calio 49 was the man at the center nick how do you want to do this senator trent lott of mississippi the republican leader said in a morning strategy session in mr lott 's office the problem was how to persuade key senators to defeat three amendments among them one that would provide health coverage to retired steelworkers who lose their benefits because of bankruptcies caused by foreign competition that proposal infuriated republicans still mad over a concession on health benefits they had already made to the democrats mr calio his reading glasses down on his nose his white cuffs with the nec monogram exposed like a lobbyist 's tattoo was ready his old job was as a lobbyist my suggestion would be that we split it up between ourselves and the cabinet secretaries and that would double hit people he told mr lott meaning that senators would be lobbied twice mr lott nodded then asked now what democrats are we going to get mr calio whipped out a sheet of names we 've got an extensive list of targets he replied a short time later mr calio was in his war room the vice president 's office in a corner of the capitol sending out staff members with lists of senators to lobby at the same time he was on the phone to mr lott alarmed about a republican who had said the trade bill could wait until next year that 's outrageous mr calio said he seemed stressed out exhausted and happy it 's the best job in the world mr calio said you are right in the middle of everything all the time there are a lot of problems and even on the days when it 's all washing over you and people are screaming at you about one thing or another it 's still fun in its own odd way you have to enjoy that mr calio who had the same but less busy job in the administration of bush i said the president sometimes called five times a day to check on legislation i know the media loves to think he is n't engaged mr calio said the guy knows every single issue he follows what goes on on the hill very closely on thursday mr calio had the president meet in mr lott 's office with five republican senators from steel producing states george v voinovich and mike dewine of ohio arlen specter and rick santorum of pennsylvania and jeff sessions of alabama he wanted to remind them that he had recently helped them out by imposing 30 percent tariffs on foreign steel imports and now he needed their help to defeat the steelworkers amendment it was forceful pressure reminding them that sometimes you give and sometimes you get mr calio said mr calio who said his biggest legislative victory was the bush tax cut and his biggest defeat was the senate rejection of oil drilling in alaska lives with his wife and three children in chevy chase md he collects wine sleeps three to four hours a night and has a sense of humor that evidently amuses the president on a day when mr bush gave a speech at the white house about cloning mr calio persuaded andrew h card jr the white house chief of staff to join him in wearing a george w bush mask into the oval office hey mr president how did the cloning event go mr calio asked as he and mr card strolled in
