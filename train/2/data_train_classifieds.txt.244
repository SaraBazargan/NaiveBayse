 when president mwai kibaki of kenya arrived at the white house recently for a state visit his wife lucy kibaki was at his side resplendent in a flowing gown perhaps fortunately for the white house protocol office which has little experience with polygamous relationships mr kibaki left his second wife wambui kibaki back home mr kibaki 's multiple marriage has been known for decades among close friends and family in his native village of othaya near mount kenya but most kenyan voters first learned of it on sunday morning nearly a year into mr kibaki 's presidency when a local newspaper the east african standard splashed a profile of mr kibaki 's second wife on its front page such a complicated family life is not uncommon here by no means limited to muslims polygamy is widely practiced in africa particularly among the well off members of mr kibaki 's generation who can afford multiple dowries and the expense of keeping more than one home but polygamy is also falling from favor according to social scientists and women 's rights advocates especially among younger kenyans and mr kibaki has not sought to publicize his living arrangements his official campaign web site for example mentioned only one mrs kibaki i do n't believe in sharing husbands said rose nganga 20 a nairobi college student if my husband were to bring another wife he would have to either divorce her or me why should i be the second wheel to a man for polygamy to work peacefully the wives must buy into the tradition sometimes an older wife will actually assist her husband in choosing a younger bride typically to provide some assistance with all the work at the homestead but kenya 's newspapers are rife with stories of disputes between wives of the same husband they frequently scheme against each other and sometimes come to blows andrew 26 a nairobi bartender who declined to give his last name grew up in such a situation his father took his mother 's sister as a second wife when he was about 7 i remember being confused on whether i should call her aunt or stepmother he said in an interview it became too much for my mother and we left i was not in a polygamous family for that long but it was long enough to understand that it breaks home and hearts mr kibaki 's home life is by all accounts a calm one lucy kibaki a former schoolteacher whom mr kibaki married in the 1960 's lives with the president wambui kibaki who was also a schoolteacher before meeting mr kibaki in the 1970 's occupies the presidential ranch it is lucy kibaki who typically appears at mr kibaki 's side at ceremonial functions and acts as first lady but wambui kibaki is often just a few rows behind the first couple as she was last friday at a 40th anniversary celebration of kenya 's independence from britain wambui kibaki has her own security detail and more access to the presidential office compound than many ministers parliament is debating whether the government ought to provide benefits should a retired president have more than one spouse in the only interview she has given since her husband took over the presidency a year ago wambui kibaki said she was comfortable with her arrangement i do not feel restricted she told the standard i have my time with him just as before he became president i go to state house when i want and i ca n't complain i am his wife and not being made public does not bother me mr kibaki is not the first polygamous politician here kenya 's first president jomo kenyatta had several wives although only one of them took on the official role of first lady a recently retired member of parliament dickson kihaika kimani has more than a dozen wives last fall he sought to have two of them join him in parliament but voters rejected their candidacies and his as well supporters of the practice say that in the aids era polygamy is a far healthier arrangement than another one favored by many men one wife and one or more mistresses or even prostitutes on the same day that the standard was detailing mr kibaki 's home life nairobi 's other major newspaper the daily nation broke the story of a major prostitution sting that rounded up more than 100 young girls many of them university students among those caught up in the police roundup were three top kenyan politicians all of them married men and all videotaped with seminude prostitutes in their vehicles but polygamous relationships too are blamed for helping spread aids the more sexual partners involved critics say even under the cloak of marriage the greater risk of the disease spreading particularly as some men take on multiple wives and still have affairs on the side in an advertising campaign aimed at reducing the spread of aids mr kibaki urges kenyans to be faithful he avoids the ticklish question of how much faithfulness he thinks that kenyan men ought to spread around
