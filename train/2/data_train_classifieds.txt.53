 tobacco companies hoping that smoking scenes in hollywood movies would increase sales worked diligently through the 1980 's and early 90 's to get as much screen time for their brands as possible a british medical report says and at least one company went so far as to provide free cigarettes to actors and directors who might therefore be more inclined to light up when the cameras rolled the report released today by tobacco control a british medical quarterly that focuses on antismoking issues is based on more than 1500 formerly secret tobacco industry documents that became available as a result of the master settlement agreement between tobacco companies and states attorneys general in 1998 in many ways it confirmed what we suspected all along said curtis mekemson a consultant for the american lung association and the study 's prime author the tobacco companies were well aware of the benefits of having audiences especially young audiences see their favorite stars smoking on screen the most surprising revelation in the report mr mekemson said was that at least one tobacco company r j reynolds worked through a hollywood publicist to provide free tobacco in the early 80 's to actors and directors including jerry lewis john cassavetes liv ullmann and shelley winters that was really one of the most insidious revelations said kori titus director of antismoking programs for the american lung association of sacramento emigrant trails which sponsored the research they wanted to make sure hollywood stayed hooked on tobacco because actors who smoke are more likely to smoke in public or want to smoke on screen the documents listed 188 actors directors and other celebrities but it was unclear whether others might also have received free cigarettes or when the program ended nothing in the report however contradicts previous assertions by tobacco companies that they halted paid product placement more than a decade ago the industry papers studied end in the mid 1990 's and researchers were unable to find any evidence that tobacco companies continued providing free cigarettes or paying to place their product in films or television shows but this has had little impact on the frequency of smoking scenes the researchers say tobacco use in movies which was falling through the 1970 's and 1980 's increased significantly after 1990 the report concluded while there may be various reasons for this trend the extensive groundwork laid by the tobacco industry in the 1980 's and early 1990 's certainly played a role jack valenti president of the motion picture association of america which represents the major hollywood studios said he could not comment on a report he has not yet studied but he said nothing he had heard about it led him to believe there was any evidence of continuing efforts by tobacco companies to pay to place their brands on screen and he scoffed at the idea that hollywood stars could be bought for the price of a carton of cigarettes all of this is about what was happening 20 years ago mr valenti said what 's happening now if you 're a movie star why do you need anybody to give you a pack of cigarettes the issue mr valenti said is one of artistic freedom and creative choices i am opposed to smoking in movies he added it 's not good for your health but i am not an ideologue on this i am also a believer in freedom if somebody wants to smoke that 's their business the issue of paid tobacco product placement in which companies paid hollywood studios to include positive scenes of brand name tobacco use first became a flash point in the late 80 's culminating in 1989 congressional hearings the following year the tobacco companies amended their cigarette advertising and promotion code and promised to stop such product placement that voluntary move gained legal weight in 1998 when it became part of the companies settlement with the attorneys general in the intervening years although antismoking activists have found dozens of instances of movies using brand name cigarettes in scenes the studios and tobacco companies have maintained that there has been no further paid product placement mr mekemson acknowledged that there was nothing in the documents studied nor has anything emerged in the years since the documents ended to disprove that claim he said the companies were still allowed to provide free cigarettes and posters and billboard images to film productions and to sponsor film industry events like festivals golf tournaments and company picnics ms titus said that her group 's current effort was to convince hollywood to include warnings about tobacco use in its film ratings a move that mr valenti vehemently opposes the minute the ratings system starts with smoking then it 's going to be a movie where some chicken head is knocked off and it will become about cruelty to animals mr valenti said everybody will want a piece of the action
