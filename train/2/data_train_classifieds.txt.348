 mayor rudolph w giuliani often begins his sentences with the phrase the reality is yesterday the reality he had to gingerly but firmly convey to embattled new yorkers was that the work being done on the spot where the world trade center once stood a place at once a burial ground crime scene tourist attraction and development site is no longer principally a recovery operation and has not been for some time in explaining that the mayor acknowledged the feelings of firefighters who know that scores of their colleagues remains are among the twisted steel and massive piles of debris at ground zero but he also made it clear that he felt it was no longer reasonable to have dozens of them picking through the debris at their own potential peril and that he would not tolerate violence in response to his decision i 've known from the beginning from the first night that it would be a burial ground the mayor said yesterday in perhaps the most blunt language he has used to describe the site since the attack the medical examiner the first night that i met with him on the evening of sept 11 told me that the crush of the buildings and the high degree of heat was going to mean that i think he said then the majority or vast majority of people would disappear because they would evaporate with that he put into words the painful image that the world has only silently mulled as the number of confirmed dead remains far below those believed to be missing that 's a horrible and terrible thing to have to confront he said during an afternoon news conference and you might remember my saying the first day or the first night that some things might be too difficult for people to comprehend or even accept initially but that 's the reality of what happened at the world trade center and we have to deal with it in a dignified way and in a professional way many firefighters were so disturbed by the city 's decision to remove most of them from the scene that a few hundred of them protested yesterday in a display that culminated in the arrests of 12 some were arrested for striking police officers the very people they have labored with side by side at the site yesterday 's spectacle and the response from city officials and the mayor in particular exposed the full spectrum of an entire city 's anguish there is the harsh truth that few remains will be discovered there is a mayor who has spent nearly every day at firefighters funerals or memorial services but who is now the object of their rage there is the anger and the guilt of all the living represented by a group of firefighters whose depth of emotions may not have been considered by the government officials left to break the news to them in the backdrop of all this anthrax attacks continue there is all told a giant municipal void where bodies information and succor are not if the mayor knew from day 1 that there was little likelihood of discovering bodies at ground zero he kept it to himself from the day the towers toppled into a vast pile of rubble he described the scene as a rescue operation and hewed to that description for nearly a month when it seemed clear that no life could be found there indeed emergency room employees stood eerily idle from the first hour on and the mayor has always made a point of emphasizing that discovering human remains was a top priority even as the bulldozers moved in when it became obvious that the recovery work would yield little he moved to give families urns of dust from the site a poignant but indirect statement of what would probably not happen and allowed people to get death certificates for loved ones all the while stressing that no one had to if they did not wish to but yesterday marked a clear shift when the living took precedence over the dead all of us standing here have friends that continue to remain there mr giuliani said and we would love to recover them but none of us standing here can possibly justify seeing a human being die in this effort if it is n't handled with great discipline and great responsibility as such just as doctors are advised never to treat their own family members the mayor seemed to think firefighters should not be involved in the clean up the reality is then said mr giuliani if you 're the police commissioner or the fire commissioner or the mayor and you 're responsible for the lives of other people you have to say well maybe these people are too emotionally involved to be involved in this operation maybe these are not the people that have the ability to detach so they can handle it professionally
