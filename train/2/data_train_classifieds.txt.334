 the sept 11 hijackings have left pilots wanting more knowledge about activity in the passenger cabin without stepping through their newly fortified doors now the transportation department with encouragement from congress is considering requiring video cameras that will provide images of passengers to the cockpit manufacturers working to anticipate a demand are developing systems including one that would transmit images from hidden cameras to the cockpit and to tiny hand held screens that air marshals could look at without blowing their cover united airlines will begin a six month test of cabin surveillance this summer using a system built by rockwell collins which has its headquarters here the system feeds the images from as many as 32 cameras to hand held computers in the cockpit and beams them back into the cabin where they can be picked up by a pocket computer robert g geers of rockwell collins demonstrated the system on an hp jornada which captured the images from tiny cameras hidden in a model of a first class cabin it also captured pictures from a camera focused on people in a hotel conference room here who jerked a bit like a charlie chaplin character because the system does not run as fast as an ordinary television but the image was clear mr geers tapped the screen with a stylus to alternate among images to the guy next to the marshal it just looks like he 's playing a video game said mr geers a business development manager united plans a four camera system on a boeing 747 that pilots can use to assure themselves before they emerge from the cockpit to use the lavatory that no one is lurking behind the door in wait since sept 11 airlines have relied on secret knocks and passwords jet blue a new airline based in new york that flies a new airbus a320 fleet recently put cameras on several of its 25 planes and expects to install them on all planes in a few months two cameras are visible one outside the cockpit door and the other at the rear galley and two others are hidden said fiona morrison a spokeswoman it gives our pilots some eyes she said security officials are intrigued at a hearing of the senate commerce committee on may 21 the undersecretary of transportation for security john magaw said no to giving pilots guns but expressed strong interest in giving them video surveillance of the cabin if pilots knew a hijacking attempt was under way they could throw their planes into radical maneuvers mr magaw said to knock the hijackers over unless you are seat belted in they can make your equilibrium so that you ca n't function he said senator barbara boxer democrat of california said it 's not expensive it 's not a new tech a high tech situation it 's a rearview mirror please do it do n't wait united likes the idea of surveillance but not radical maneuvers i do n't mind the rearview mirror part said capt joseph d burns united 's director for flight operations technology in a telephone interview but he said airplanes are tested up to certain limits in maneuvering exceed that and you 're a test pilot he said your chance of damaging the aircraft beyond repair exceeds your chance of disabling a hijacker the rockwell collins camera system can be configured to record and to play back the last few seconds and can be set up to beam images to the ground rockwell collins 's main american rival in the commercial avionics business honeywell has been offering camera systems to airlines since early this year said ben mcleod the company 's director of aviation safety and security mr mcleod said in a telephone interview that he thought flight crew unions would push the airlines into installing the systems even if the government never required them ultimately that 's where the motivation will come from he said the systems could sell for a second reason he said the occurrence of hijackings is going to be so rare he said but air rage is far more frequent before sept 11 air rage was a major concern for airlines what we 've seen historically is the only cases successfully prosecuted were those where they had had some hard evidence mr mcleod said a tape would provide that he added mr mcleod said honeywell 's system would have at least three cameras mostly to assure people on the flight deck that it was safe to come out to use the restroom but there could be 10 on a large plane he said mr geers of rockwell foresaw cameras in cargo holds to look for stowaways or other problems and cameras under the belly so pilots at the gate could tell whether the cargo doors had been latched the honeywell system 's cameras could be black and white or color but the system will also use infrared mr mcleod said that makes it possible for the system to see in the dark at jet blue executives decided that recording the images would violate passengers privacy but a placard on the cockpit door tells passengers that they may be under video surveillance that alone may reduce air rage ms morrison said
