 a neo nazi gunman who tried to kill president jacques chirac during the bastille day parade on sunday was committed to a psychiatric hospital today pending the outcome of a judicial investigation to determine whether he was criminally responsible for his actions at the moment of the shooting the man maxime brunerie 25 an accounting student and part time chauffeur was wrestled to the ground by spectators and police officers after he fired one shot at mr chirac from a 22 caliber hunting rifle at the time the french leader was being driven in an open jeep down the champs elysees toward a reviewing stand at the place de la concorde the attack the first attempted assassination of a french president in almost 40 years has prompted calls for an immediate review of mr chirac 's security arrangements as well as demands for tighter gun control mr brunerie needed no permit to buy his rifle he was supposed to register it but had not done so but in general reaction has been surprisingly calm with one center right paris daily newspaper le figaro not even leading its monday edition with the incident mr chirac 's response to news that a shot had been fired at him was also nonchalant ah bon oh really today he telephoned four parade spectators to thank them for their intervention their courage and their sang froid in tackling mr brunerie the most disturbing element of the attack for many people is mr brunerie 's link to the extreme rightist and neo nazi groups that operate in the shadows of french political life although the police expressed the belief that he acted alone they quickly made public his membership in a thuggish student band called union defense group as well as in radical unity a group known for its negationist anti semitic and anti american views this group is in turn associated with the french european nationalist party an openly neo nazi group with connections to similar groups elsewhere in europe the incident has also increased fears that violence is becoming part of europe 's political reality two months ago the far right dutch leader pim fortuyn was murdered just days before crucial parliamentary elections in march marco biagi a lawyer preparing controversial labor legislation in italy was murdered by a group claiming to be on the far left today in a telegram of support to mr chirac the german chancellor gerhard schroder said that the right wing extremist backdrop of this abominable attack again shows how seriously we must take the threat it represents but whether or not his associations played a part mr brunerie 's action on sunday was clearly premeditated he bought the rifle on july 6 he rented a car to drive to paris on sunday and he even posted a message on a far right english language web site urging people to watch the bastille day parade i 'll be the star he said he then brought the gun to paris in a guitar case after his arrest the police said that he had admitted wanting to kill mr chirac to save france and that he had then planned to commit suicide this evening paris prosecutors said he had been committed to a psychiatric hospital outside paris because of the danger he poses to himself and others at the same time opening a judicial investigation will enable experts to determine his fitness to face trial for attempted murder prosecutors said a decision is expected within a month in march 2001 mr brunerie ran in municipal elections on the ticket of the national republic movement a legally registered far right party headed by bruno megret who broke with jean marie le pen 's larger national front four years ago mr brunerie won only 29 percent of votes cast but his candidacy linked mr megret 's party to still more extreme rightist groups radical unity for example backed mr megret in the first round of presidential elections this year and supported mr le pen in the runoff vote won overwhelmingly by mr chirac today mr megret condemned the assassination attempt as an odious and senseless act and described mr brunerie as by all evidence a psychiatric case mr le pen was more dismissive noting that i quite expected that if there was a madman they 'd find a way of saying he was from the extreme right a statement on the web site of radical unity said that it is not up to us to condone or excuse his act but simply to assure him in his present distress that comradeship is not for us a empty word it added that terrorism was not a solution to the political and moral crisis affecting france the newspaper le monde said mr brunerie had reportedly told two radical unity colleagues of his desire to kill mr chirac but they said they thought he was joking today the police questioned those and other far rightists as well as mr brunerie 's sister his parents who were on vacation in spain returned to paris this evening and were expected to be questioned tuesday mr brunerie lives with them in courcouronnes 20 miles south of paris
