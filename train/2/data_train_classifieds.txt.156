 remember the doublemint twins remember jingles like hi ho hey hey chew your little troubles away the wm wrigley jr company is working hard to make you forget them faster than your chewing gum loses its flavor on the bedpost wrigley the nation 's leading maker of gum is accelerating ambitious efforts to convince consumers particularly those ages 12 to 34 who buy and chew gum at rates far higher than their older counterparts that the company long ago put behind it dated devices like hokey songs and spookily ever smiling models after remaking the advertising and promotion for brands like big red juicy fruit orbit and winterfresh wrigley is updating two of its most venerable products wrigley 's spearmint and doublemint in a pair of multimillion dollar campaigns infused with snappy humor the longtime wrigley agency bbdo chicago is promoting reformulations and redesigned packaging for spearmint introduced in 1893 and doublemint brought out in 1914 there is also a new theme for spearmint now you wo n't want to chew on anything else in the brand 's first campaign in five years as well as one for doublemint feel the green and now feel it longer though doublemint retains a duality approach the twins have been replaced by 21st century sisters the tennis stars serena and venus williams what we did was relevant for consumers in its day and worked in its time said paul chibe director for united states consumer marketing at wrigley in chicago there 's definitely an opportunity to have wrigley be much more attuned to consumers today the revamping of the pitches for doublemint and spearmint is indicative of the re energizing of the somnolent wrigley marketing machinery by a new chief executive bill wrigley jr who also recently made an audacious ultimately unsuccessful bid to acquire the hershey foods corporation bill is a guy very much focused on the future with a healthy dose of impatience said phillip gant executive vice president and chief creative officer at the chicago office of bbdo worldwide part of the omnicom group he has much more of a vision of the possibilities the brand images can have to help stimulate growth in an increasingly competitive confectionery field mr wrigley is eager for consumers to at long last perceive wrigley 's advertising products and promotions as contemporary there is enormous equity in the wrigley brand and its product brands but the problem is that the company has n't been relating to the next generation of consumers for its survival said raleigh c green principal at corporate voice in new york which specializes in online brand communications the younger generation is smart and media savvy he added and needs to be talked to not talked down to at the same time for the makeover to be effective it must avoid damaging positive elements of the company 's image like its hard earned reputation for selling tasty inexpensive treats obviously it 's a fine line you 're walking when you update heritage brands said michael cucka a partner at group 1066 in new york a corporate identity consultant wrigley has been understated throughout its history an alternative to the carnival style shouting at the gum counter he added do you stay true to who you are or do you take a risk wrigley has decided to pursue a strategy characterized by the oxymoron of careful risk when consumers are asked for their reaction to wrigley 's shift to a more modern marketing voice most people say 'about time mr gant said because the previous approach was kitsch for a lot of them as a result for so long people did n't notice the advertising it was wallpaper he added if you 're doing advertising people ca n't relate to it 's hard to weave the brands into the fabric of american culture to accomplish that now bbdo chicago is taking a playful approach to re presenting the doublemint and spearmint personas for doublemint print and outdoor advertising shows bold images with wry headlines one ad for example featuring a luscious shot of a green wrapped venus williams carries the headline mint that hits the sweet spot which has a nudge nudge double meaning for tennis fans another ad featuring an oversize shot of a smiling young man carries the headline mint sweet enough to show some love borrowing a phrase from the urban vernacular for spearmint there are radio commercials along with the print and outdoor ads the spots avoid jingles in favor of humor that is uncharacteristically cartoonish for wrigley for instance in one spot a man is dressed in pants made of redwood and turned loose in a boxcar filled with crazed beavers which prefer to chew on spearmint rather than him in another commercial a man is dressed like a wounded seal and dropped into shark infested waters the sharks have chosen longer lasting spearmint the announcer intones except for that one he did n't get any and he 's mad the spot ends with jaws  like music and screaming it 's a smart strategy said dr robert passikoff president at brand keys in new york a brand and customer loyalty consulting company it allows them to position their gums as being modern and cool which is what they need to do dr passikoff likened the campaigns to one bbdo chicago created for a newer wrigley brand orbit spoofing serious product demonstrations with mock gum tests in our research a lot of older people complained about the orbit ads he said laughing and we said 'guess what they were n't made for you bbdo chicago has created wrigley ads since 1979 when it acquired the arthur meyerhoff agency which began working for wrigley in 1933 the budgets for the doublemint and spearmint campaigns are being estimated at 10 million each wrigley spent 79 million in major media to advertise doublemint last year according to the cmr division of taylor nelson sofres and nothing on spearmint sales of spearmint in the 52 weeks that ended sept 8 totaled 211 million according to information resources down 47 percent from the period a year ago and sales of doublemint totaled 373 million down 72 percent
