 the new york state department of health cited coney island hospital yesterday for 23 health violations and ordered it to hire a consultant to improve its emergency room care saying the staff provided insufficient treatment last summer to a woman who said she had been beaten and raped under the boardwalk the department also fined the hospital 46000 and placed it on probation for one year it was the fourth time this year that the state 's health commissioner dr antonia c novello sharply criticized a new york city hospital and issued a large fine the investigation examined the hospital 's treatment of a 31 year old woman who was attacked last july by anthony jones a serial sex offender who had been released the night before from the great meadow correctional facility he placed the woman in a chokehold and dragged her under the boardwalk she told the police that she had been raped and that her life had been threatened until she broke free and ran onto surf avenue the authorities took her to coney island hospital for treatment and a rape exam the new york times reported in may that the hospital had failed to send critical pieces of forensic evidence from the victim 's rape examination including the woman 's underwear and swabs from her genital area to the city medical examiner 's office where officials try to isolate attackers dna in rape cases without the evidence prosecutors had to withdraw their rape charge against mr jones who pleaded guilty to attempted assault and was sentenced to two to four years in prison mr jones 42 who has spent much of his adult life in prison for sex attacks in new york and arizona had faced a possible life sentence if convicted of rape the state 's investigation found a series of problems in the victim 's treatment from an exam by a resident that was deemed cursory to a failure to ensure that the victim received adequate screening for sexually transmitted diseases and complete medication to prevent pregnancy although the woman 's case was classified as urgent she was not fully examined for more than three hours the state said in its conclusions which were submitted to the hospital yesterday the mistakes continued until the victim 's last moment at the hospital the state found and included an incomplete evaluation by a social worker who apparently did not offer the victim a homeless prostitute and heroin addict referrals for substance abuse treatment or shelter the state found there were multiple problems that occurred in the care of this individual said wayne m osten director of the state 's office of health system management which investigated the case dr jane d zimmerman spokeswoman for the city 's health and hospitals corporation which supervises coney island hospital and 10 other public hospitals said the investigation had gone too far the hospital 's emergency room she said handled 46000 visits last year including more than 100 rape and sexual assault cases this is the first and only time the contents of a rape kit have been questioned she said this is an extreme overreaction by the state department of health it is overkill of enormous proportion what exactly happened to the missing evidence is still not clear dr zimmerman said the resident who performed the exam told investigators that she had done it completely dr zimmerman also said that the fallout of the case had reverberated through the hospital to the extent that the state hospital review and planning council was holding up the corporation 's effort to get approval on a 105 million renovation dr novello the health commissioner said she was particularly angered about the case because it involved a homeless victim she suggested that medical care and compassion was denied the woman because of her station in life rape victims she said should be treated the same irrespective of whether the victim was homeless or the richest woman in new york state the investigation 's list of deficiencies was unsparing criticizing the hospital from its nursing staff and social workers to its highest level of management the state ordered the hospital to submit a plan within 10 days describing how it would correct each of the 23 violations the state also ordered the hospital to hire an independent consultant to analyze the operation and management of the emergency department and to submit recommendations for

said the sanction was the fourth against a hospital in the city this year in february the health department fined beth israel medical center after an obstetrician carved his initials into a woman 's abdomen in march it fined maimonides medical center for covering up an operation in which a surgeon removed a patient 's healthy kidney also that month it fined staten island hospital for failing to
