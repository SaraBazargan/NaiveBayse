 dianne reeves this jazz singer finally got around to making a small group acoustic album but a little moonlight blue note is nearly as ponderous as her other albums astride the jazz pop fault line when she wants to swing hard and efficaciously she can it happens on the title track more often however her voice is frustratingly confined to the pedestal she has built for it still the simple fact of a small band is a good thing to hear this colossal precisely aimed voice skipping down scales not skimping on any of the notes along the way and with so few other instruments intruding on it is to hear good singing gaby kerpel mr kerpel is the argentinean composer responsible for the what country is this from music that accompanies the de la guarda troupe the gravity defying dancers and acrobats who run along walls and ceilings on carnabailito nonesuch he takes bits of argentine music most of which he plays and samples himself and alters them digitally into dream material you do n't really know where it comes from or what purpose it serves he replicates the nasal singing and rough playing of south american folk styles using instruments like cavaquinhos and wooden flutes and slows it down to wrap all kinds of backward sounding samples around it the record 's overall production is by gustavo santaolalla who records instruments cleanly and spaciously it 's an album in the same school as those by the latin playboys the los lobos side project produced by tchad blake messy mesmerizing a spaced out intellectualization of cultural roots papo vazquez carnival in san juan cubop ubiquity the new album by the latin jazz trombonist papo vazquez and his group pirates and troubadours also manipulates cultural roots mr vazquez has divided his life between new york and puerto rico playing and composing in the island 's three century old bomba and plena rhythms and moving them up into a more modern rhetoric of latin jazz so the album is full of rich heavy drumming but mr vazquez 's strong highly rhythmic trombone style and its able interactions with a rhythm section produce some of the best latin jazz around jason moran but letting go of history if done judiciously can produce good music too one of the fascinations of mr moran 's work over the last two years is simply the sound of it its textures and dynamics nasheet waits 's drums spit and mumble rarely acceding to a cycle of groove tarus mateen 's acoustic electric bass has a twangier weedier sound than the double bass he used to use and mr moran 's playing keeps heating up and dissipating as the collective improvisations roll along so i find i have to keep adjusting the volume when i listen to the bandwagon the new live recording by his trio on blue note jazz records in the main are n't supposed to fluctuate like that but mr moran is not worrying about being background for your dinner the inclusion of pieces by brahms and afrika bambaataa in a set recorded live at the village vanguard as well as one composed by transcribing a telephone conversation in turkish are further signs of a feisty relationship with jazz decorum i like the idea that jazz can be responsible to what it 's always done best rhythm expressed through a savvy adult social sophistication while proceeding unrestrictedly in the pursuit of different sounding records there are few if any visionary producers in jazz like mr santaolalla to help the musicians the musicians have to control the ideas the execution and the representation on disc all of which makes mr moran 's accomplishment that much more remarkable terry hall and mushtaq mr hall who used to be the singer in the specials has one of the unforgettable voices in british pop the specials made great high energy ska but what really established mr hall as an expressive singer were regretful dirges recorded toward the end of the band 's life like ghost town and friday night saturday morning in the hour of two lights astralwerks a new album he collaborates with mushtaq from the british asian band fun da mental mr hall has an amateur 's admiration for middle eastern music and was emboldened to make the record by the pop star damon albarn 's recent collaboration with malian musicians mushtaq set up tape loops added furious hand drumming and had a battery of musicians play instruments like oud ney and shehnai over the rhythm bed and there it is again that wonderful quavering voice of knitted brow uncertainty coming not just from mr hall but from the middle eastern singers who appear on the record
