 as baseball officials and owners paint an increasingly bleaker picture of baseball 's economics two teams have stepped forward as exhibits a and b the tampa bay devil rays and the detroit tigers recently experienced payroll problems and needed bank loans to pay their players people in baseball familiar with the problems said yesterday both teams said they have had no trouble meeting their payrolls but the people who disclosed the developments provided specific details of how the devil rays and the tigers resolved their problems and averted being plunged into uncharted financial territory players are paid twice monthly and it was the june 15 payment the devil rays and the tigers were having trouble with the people who told about it said the tigers one of them said also faced a problem with next monday 's payroll but worked out that one too bob dupuy chief operating officer of major league baseball declined to comment on the identity of the teams or their specific problems but he said i believe any issues with regard to meeting expenses currently have been resolved and that there 's no immediate problem for any team he added that any problems that might have existed were a matter of cash flow and ongoing expenses these potential payroll problems are a reflection of the economic problems major league baseball says its lower revenue clubs face commissioner bud selig reiterated this week his contention that some teams are in deep financial trouble and baseball has hammered home that point in its negotiations with the players union for a new labor contract the owners are seeking an agreement that would provide financial relief while the union feels the owners proposals would make too much of an inroad into players salaries one person who told of the problems said the tigers secured a commercial loan backed by a guarantee from the team owner michael ilitch to make next week 's payroll for the june 15 payrolls the tigers and the devil rays secured loans using distributions from baseball 's central fund as collateral the central fund is the repository for revenue from such sources as the national television package and licensing the commissioner 's office periodically though not on a regular schedule distributes money from the fund to the 30 teams as an aid to the devil rays and the tigers the commissioner 's office wrote a letter confirming that the central fund money would be distributed to all of the teams this month the two teams presented the letter to their banks and as a result the banks lent them money against that distribution to cover their payrolls the devil rays experience was reminiscent of one they encountered last season in may when vincent naimoli the team 's managing partner was involved in a nasty fight with his five partners the club was facing difficulty in meeting the player payroll but naimoli added his own money to the team treasury and paid the players with some of that the devils rays problems have apparently been so dire this season that two people said they have offered to sell players to other teams because they have needed the cash naimoli declined to return a telephone call seeking comment but a devil rays spokesman rick vaughn said it was not true that the club was having difficulty meeting its payroll ilitch the tigers owner did not return a call seeking comment dave dombrowski the club president said he was not involved in those matters but said we 've met our payroll and do n't feel there 's any problem and we 'll continue to meet our payrolls the financial health of the teams has been the dominant issue in the collective bargaining talks that resumed yesterday in manhattan on the day of the all star game selig was asked at a news conference whether baseball during its negotiations with the players could have made its case more emphatically if it had let a team or two go bankrupt i have said that and the clubs have said that to me he replied they know i 've helped two or three clubs out in the past year or two and yes i now understand in retrospect that maybe it would have been better to let them go it certainly would have been another dynamic manifestation of the problems he added earlier this season selig said six to eight teams could wind up in bankruptcy if there were a work stoppage at a recent bargaining session dupuy told union representatives that if there were a prolonged work stoppage caused by either side once they reached an agreement on the major issues they would not be talking about back service credit for players but about clubs not coming back in the years since salaries began escalating owners have handled their financial situations differently when ewing kauffman owned the kansas city royals he poured part of his personal fortune into the team to pay its best players and maintain its status as a perennial contender he said he acted for the benefit of the community h wayne huizenga on the other hand treated the florida marlins as strictly business when he felt his losses had become too great he sold the team though not until he had dismantled the 1997 world series champions rather than incur greater losses while he still owned them in the continuing labor negotiations the clubs want the players to agree to a system in which teams would share 50 percent of their local revenue as a means of improving the chances of low revenue teams to compete with the wealthier clubs negotiators had been scheduled to meet during the day yesterday but instead turned the session into a dinner meeting at a restaurant they planned to meet again today we discussed all of the major issues and it was a constructive discussion gene orza the union 's associate general counsel said of last night 's gathering baseball 's claims of financial woe could have an adverse effect on the ability of its teams to secure low interest loans sal galatioto head of lehman brothers holdings inc 's sports finance unit told bloomberg news yesterday that it makes people worry about the overall financial state of baseball and they were already concerned because of the possibility of a strike teams often borrow money during the season to cover expenses or new payroll additions
