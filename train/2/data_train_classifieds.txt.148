 it has been almost 34 years since stewart brand then a member of ken kesey 's band of merry pranksters hand published 1000 copies of the first whole earth catalog the last whole earth catalog won the national book award in 1972 the various editions ultimately sold more than two million copies and influenced a generation now kevin kelly a protege of mr brand has resurrected the idea with a hand published 140 page volume called cool tools like the original cool tools is a collection of minireviews of intriguing gadgets ideas books and technologies cool tools has grown from an electronic mailing list and web site maintained by mr kelly and a group of volunteer contributors the irony said mr kelly is that the rise of the web and the proliferation of information has increased the need for collections like cool tools that have an editorial point of view there 's kind of a small swerve back toward not spending all your day in front of the computer he said the web is about all possibilities and it makes it hard to say 'this is best when you want an authority you have to go back to an author like the original whole earth catalog the cool tools project has been propelled by word of mouth last month mr kelly used a laser printer to print 250 copies for friends and acquaintances he soon received an order for 300 copies from amazon which lists them for 20 each he has printed an additional 1000 copies mr brand said that cool tools had captured the spirit of the whole earth catalog but without taking on a counterculture and back to the land philosophy it proves that you can restart the essence of something he said like google which proved you can always reinvent any seemingly filled niche and have it all to yourself mr kelly says he is attempting to keep the cool tools project a hobby and a mechanism for exploring new publishing models this is the century of the enthusiast he said we have pro sumers people who are both producers and consumers enthusiasts are people who are running the world john markoff
