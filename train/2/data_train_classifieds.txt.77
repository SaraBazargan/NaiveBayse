 his boss left on an airplane late this afternoon without him steve park would have to find a much slower way to get back to north carolina i 'll hitchhike home if i have to park said beaming park who drives a chevrolet owned by the fussy dale earnhardt sr was held up because he finally won his first nascar winston cup race and earned the right to pose for photos spray champagne and jump up and down on the roof of his car the 32 year old native of east northport ny moved into contention early held his lead by virtue of a sensational pit stop then held off a thrilling late charge by the veteran mark martin to win the grueling temper testing global crossing at the glen by not much more than a car length afterward park received a thumbs up from martin and a visit in the victory circle from earnhardt for whom park has driven for nearly three seasons this was the same racetrack at which earnhardt first made note of park 's driving talent a few years ago now after 77 races an accident that cost him half the 1998 season and some shuffling of his crew park had his first victory he felt he had earned it a young guy like me is not used to the pressure of holding off a mark martin to win a race park said this was an exasperating day for almost everyone but park jeff gordon who had won a record six straight winston cup races on road courses including the last three here collided with tony stewart on the second of 90 laps and quickly fell from contention gordon finished 23rd when gordon pulled his mangled car next to stewart 's mangled car after the race stewart summoned him over and the two drivers swapped accusations as if they were still banging into each other on the track stewart pointing a finger and lacing each sentence with profanity accused gordon of reneging on his promise to avoid an accident early in the race you should practice what you preach stewart said later gordon said i made a clean move and i do n't think he wanted me to pass him maybe i was trying to go too hard too early but i think there could have been a little bit more consideration there earnhardt lost control of his chevrolet and spun into the styrofoam lined fence on lap 2 it was a costly accident for earnhardt who had been hoping to win his eighth winston cup championship he finished 25th with black tape holding the back of his car together and fell 217 points behind bobby labonte the leader in the points standing labonte finished fifth two spots ahead of dale jarrett and stretched his lead to a season best 101 points over jarrett with 13 races remaining i thought the car was going to be pretty good today but we 'll just have to forget about it now earnhardt said good drivers began to drop out in a hurry ron fellows the road course specialist who finished second to gordon at the glen last year moved to 15th from 40th in only 13 laps but abruptly dropped back because of engine trouble it looks like last year was a lot more difficult than we thought fellows said it 's a shame rusty wallace spun into the gravel next to the track jerry nadeau after moving to third from 25th to third place lost use of third gear ward burton fell from the top five after he was penalized because his crew forgot to put all the lug nuts on his tire park told himself to keep his composure and he moved up in the pack he started 18th but was in the top five after 25 laps he took the lead one third of the way into the race and gave it up briefly on his last pit stop but what a pit stop it was his crew needed only 154 seconds to refuel his car and change his tires labonte 's crew needed 172 seconds to do the same thing one lap later park found himself in the lead after everyone in the field had made his final stop and soon the race boiled down to park and martin martin closed on park 's rear bumper and stayed there as if his car had a magnet on it park said he tried to avoid the temptation to steal peeks in his rearview mirror to see where martin was park bobbled twice in the final laps once when his car appeared to be nudged by jeff burton 's but he kept the lead when he crossed the finish line park remembered to stick his hand out of the car and wave to the crowd he forgot to shift though and his car protested with a sudden pop that was about the only thing that went amiss today for park he was asked after the race if he told his boss now long gone that he had won one more race at watkins glen than the great earnhardt had park smiled again the boss is still the boss i would n't want to tell dale earnhardt anything that he would n't want to hear park said he still signs my paychecks
