 do people in big business really believe in free enterprise the latest argument to the contrary comes from airline chief executives who told congress recently that their industry needs relief again from the consequences of 9 11 it would be easy to deride the airlines claims they have already received 5 billion in post terror cash from the government but the truth is that the airline executives are just doing their job which is to maximize returns to investors in other words they are in business to make money and if washington is offering handouts shareholders expect them to be first in line the great paradox of capitalism in fact is that in order to succeed in the free enterprise system your best bet may be to undercut it america 's chief executives know this relatively few of them injected with high doses of truth serum would advocate an unfettered competitive marketplace the whole idea of which probably gives them nightmares what really matters is profit and most chief executives know that unfettered competition is rarely the best path to it freewheeling competition worst of all on price pales next to the riches associated with market domination consider echostar communications which is trying to acquire directv one satellite tv business is sure to be more profitable than two especially in rural areas where there is no cable alternative in this case the hand of government will be required to maintain a competitive marketplace and rupert murdoch the media mogul who covets directv for himself is lobbying accordingly since legal monopolies are hard to come by most executives prefer businesses with high barriers to entry government can help with this too by establishing costly and elaborate licensing requirements for example or by erecting barriers at the shoreline if you are in the steel business washington can shelter you from pesky imports that might force you to deliver better quality at lower prices if you are an airline chief executive your course is clear like all other experienced fund raisers you know that the best person to ask is someone who has given before that makes the federal government an obvious target certainly it 's a softer touch than the powerful unions representing well paid airline employees and getting more government largess is a lot better than cutting your own pay we are not asking for special treatment said leo f mullin chairman and chief executive of delta air lines he 's right businesses of all kinds asked for government help after 9 11 having been trained to do so by all the businesses already getting government help before the terrorist attacks what these companies mostly have in common is size airlines for instance are likelier to receive a handout than the waiters and cabdrivers thrown out of work in the travel downturn the government always seems to have money for farmers too but those wearing overalls need not apply most of the benefits go to agribusiness certainly there is no talk of a bailout for the nation 's ailing novelists despite the body blow we absorbed on that fateful day not only did it make most of us feel we were writing things that were trivial and stupid but it also hurt book sales i myself came out with a novel two weeks after 9 11 and despite favorable reviews it sank almost without a trace so far the bush administration has n't even delivered a starched hanky if i can scrape up the train fare to washington maybe we could siphon off just a little of that airline money to keep amtrak rolling i would appeal personally to congress and thanks to the airlines i can say in all seriousness that i 'm not asking for special treatment on the contrary daniel akst 's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first sunday of each month e mail culmoney nytimescom
