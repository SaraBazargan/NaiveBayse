 arthur ashe was not one for fig leaves symbolic fig leaves anyway his views regarding human and race relations as well as i recall virtually any other subject were never anything but direct you asked arthur ashe a question and he gave you not only what was on his insightful mind but what was in his heart as well it 's also true however that there is no record of his ever having played naked in a tennis tournament the latter has contributed to some of the controversy regarding that big bronze guy in the tree shaded arthur ashe commemorative garden outside arthur ashe stadium in the national tennis center in flushing meadows corona park so has the musculature it 's more rodin or arnold schwarzenegger than the lithe ashe big bronze guy stands tall 14 feet tall as a matter of fact and without even benefit of a towel around his waist tosses up a ball that has forever disappeared into the sky as he serves what 's that supposed to be a broken tennis racket said rose giaramita a hair stylist from forest hills queens i do n't get the whole thing the racket indeed appears to be sawed off suggesting perhaps something lethal which ashe 's serve often was that 's arthur ashe said isaac manjo a maryland insurance agent that 's crazy it 's a wonderful display it 's a wonderful statement there is a power and a stature to it which reflects arthur ashe said janet cook of philadelphia but i 'm offended by the nudity daniel burgess of freeport ny loathed the statue to such a degree that he handed out copies of a letter drafted to the united states tennis association demanding the immediate removal of the statue he said he had gotten 1000 signatures to no avail the statue stays said judy levering president of the usta the sculpture is not a depiction of arthur it is a representation honoring his legacy and memory some of the confusion may be in that the artist 's name for it is not in the garden 'soul in flight we probably should fix that art is always in the eye of the beholder you read it here first and art objects can have such emotional affect that they are sometimes defaced or defamed or conversely seen as depictions of faith in front of the united center in chicago an iconic sculpture of michael jordan soaring for a dunk shot has been generally hailed people throw coins at the foot of it as though it were a wishing well but only a few miles away the abstract picasso sculpture in front of city hall drew a different response it 's a heroic monument to some dead dodo a barbary ape or some sort of trojan dove said alderman john j hoellen at the unveiling several years ago dump it in lake michigan he said and put up a statue of ernie banks there is still no statue of banks the former cubs star but many athletes have been memorialized in this fashion and all of them from stan musial in st louis to willie mays in san francisco to dan marino in florida are representational but unlike say michelangelo 's david and eric fischl 's big bronze guy they are also conventionally frocked police officer frank casaburi was assigned to a beat beside the statue my supervisor told me that it 's pretty controversial he said and that some people may not understand it but we 've had no incidents personally i think it 's beautiful while isaac manjo who moved to america from his native liberia was initially put off by the sculpture not being a likeness of ashe he seemed to appreciate the rest of it i get a sense of a man struggling struggling to achieve he said arthur ashe was a role model for me and for many black folks and if it was n't for his struggles the doors would n't have been open for players like venus and serena williams and while many fans were intent on seeing the sculpture it is safe to say that they also had some interest in the other players many of whom were at least 8 feet shorter with more modest pectorals but lleyton hewitt who beat arnaud clement in his quarterfinal match yesterday seemed to encapsulate the general opinion of the players what do you think of the statue what statue he replied the one outside the stadium do n't know anything about it you were just involved in the tennis itself hewitt 's eyebrows narrowed i hope so he said
