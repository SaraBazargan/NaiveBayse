 before it was clear to her that you only have so much time on earth so you had better spend it doing what you love diane reeves sold computers for dell ms reeves 's clients were mostly corporate health care centers she had a degree from the university of texas a husband a young son a house and a career that many might envy so it came as a considerable surprise to those close to her when ms reeves decided a year ago to quit her job pick up stakes and move to new york to become of all things a fashion designer i made huge sacrifices for this ms reeves said last week as she pulled up a stool in brigitte conti 's sewing class at parsons school of design where ms reeves 35 was beginning the first term in a two year program that grants associate of arts degrees in fashion i dragged a husband and a child from texas ms reeves said with a grin and an expression that was far from resigned and i 'm looking for jobs now with salaries that are equal to my bonus at dell few professions it would seem registered the mass cultural chastening that followed the events of sept 11 as sharply as fashion as early as last spring economists were making it plain that the retailing outlook for the foreseeable future was grim it 's tough now said kal ruttenstein the fashion director of bloomingdale 's there are not a lot of new companies opening up established companies are not hiring it 's a tough moment for kids to find work in fashion in america zap following the terrorist attacks the same words and concepts that were once celebrated so lavishly turned up as pejorative terms ostentation frivolity luxury chic who needs those it seemed so frighteningly fateful that everything happened during fashion week the designer cynthia rowley remarked last week it was like a call to attention that the glamour the celebrity the fame and the hype had gotten out of control our priorities were wrong what were those priorities were they to sign on to a system that as the designer john bartlett recently said has gotten distorted to the point where all we 've been seeing are the megadesigners and megamodels and everyone 's ambition is to be mega or is it equally possible that the expectations many people in fashion hold were already pointing toward simpler more straightforward aims fueled by traditional dreams together with the fashion institute of technology also in manhattan parsons is the pre eminent incubator of design talent in the country the alumni roster of the school which was founded in 1896 includes many of those people in fashion who can be identified by a single name donna went to parsons so did calvin tom isaac and marc to name just a few it is easy enough and understandable to buy into cliches suggesting that most people who spend 20000 a year in tuition at parsons hope to forge big fashion careers the kind that include one 's name branded on the waistband of men 's underpants a heavily capitalized initial public offering or at the very least a special on e more and more it seems when i 've done critiques of students work at fashion schools over the past few years the designer anna sui said i 've found that students were focusing only on money you 'd get the sense that they thought designers spent their days draping beautiful fabric on mannequins sketching and then having lunch with their supermodel friends but well before september some fashion insiders say the tenor of the business was already undergoing change what i started telling kids mr bartlett said is that the most creative thing is open a small storefront where you can keep your costs low and it 's much more hands on writing to ingrid bergman the filmmaker jean renoir once noted that the real basis for great achievement is daily humble work within the framework of a profession among the surprises a visitor to parsons school of design recently encountered is how many of its students came to fashion for reasons that would seem familiar to mr renoir before his arrival at parsons from his native thailand werawat lungvedchakarn had already obtained a business degree in bangkok and worked for a time as an accountant at one of his family 's drugstores my brother is a physician mr lungvedchakarn explained my sister is a pharmacist my family wanted me to go into the business but it was like i was forcing myself i tried but it was not me i came to do fashion because it satisfies my passion and my dreams fiona angelini a student from australia quit a decade long international career in the cosmetics industry six of the years spent as a senior marketing executive at revlon to take up fashion studies at parsons eighteen months ago i just said 'this is not filling my soul ms angelini said i was a workaholic before but i work harder at this than i ever have in my life jessica mehta wangled a student visa and special loans to come to new york from india joanne abellera left law school fully aware that people look down on fashion especially now and feel it 's frivolous but i was very unfulfilled and this is the way to feel most creative for me at a social and psychic level thuy diep who is of vietnamese origin decided that fashion was less about sound bites and air time than deep psychic comfort people think of clothes as unimportant ms diep said when of course the act of clothing oneself is an important expression of art typically the students here are the kind of kids who in high school if their parents said 'what do you want to do and they said 'fashion they 'd have said 'you 're crazy explained pamela trough klein the director of parsons fashion program which has 470 students enrolled we 've had kids from wharton we had a guy who was a prosecutor in new orleans they come because they have to they love design lately mr ruttenstein said while some in fashion found themselves questioning the purpose of fashion its creative and commercial viability others have held tight to optimism it 's nice to think that things will change mr ruttenstein said that things will get better and people will be willing to gamble more and adventuresome talent will be hired again ms angelini for one was overcome in september with a conviction that there were few things the world needed less than another person 's concept for a pretty dress i was numb ms angelini said i could n't do any of it but little by little the desire came back the ideas returned and they had a voice in this business whatever the economic climate whatever the world events the only thing you can hope for is that yours is a voice that people will want to hear
