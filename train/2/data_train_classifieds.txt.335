 i have only a nodding acquaintance with robert a patient who sees a colleague down the hall still he waves when we pass and i register once again that he looks terrible worse than last month and far worse than last year despite that cheerful grin the skin on robert 's face is stretched tight against the bones silhouetting the movement of every muscle his smile is a death mask his arms and legs have become skinny and his torso bulky bloated into a belt encircled humpty dumpty oval when i tell you that robert is infected with hiv the virus that causes aids you would be perfectly justified in concluding that he is slowly dying you would be wrong robert is doing spectacularly well by the numbers in his chart he is an unqualified treatment success no traces of the virus in his bloodstream normal numbers of immune active cells no more of the recurrent infections that plagued him years ago back when he really was dying of aids back then he looked great taut and muscular with a slight fever flush a real adonis now restored to health with a concoction of hiv drugs he looks mortally ill like all drugs the lifesaving aids drugs have their annoying side effects nausea diarrhea skin rashes and the like but for some people they also come with a set of truly ghoulish complications slowly remodeling the body turning people into weirdly living visions of the exact fate they are taking the drugs to elude the process is called lipodystrophy a breakdown in the normal ways the body processes and stores fat of all the mysteries of aids it is proving one of the most difficult to crack some people never get it in others the body fat reacts to medication right away causing not only cosmetic disasters like robert 's but also diabetes high cholesterol heart and vascular disease and fatty fragile bones none of the 15 aids drugs on the market seem entirely free of risk no treatment seems very effective confusing the picture is that as aids patients live longer they are beginning to fall victim to the ordinary consequences of aging like diabetes cholesterol problems and slowly expanding waistlines what comes from the medication what from passing years a study presented at an aids conference in chicago last month found that an alarming 63 percent of people taking antiretroviral drugs developed lipodystrophy but according to the definition of the syndrome researchers were using 33 percent of ordinary hiv negative controls got it too aids clinics have always been full of strange juxtapositions drag queens slumped next to pregnant women businessmen leaning away from nodding addicts never has the scene been stranger than it is now when the well often look quite sick and the sick quite well and no one can say for sure if the arrival of that small gut of middle age is something to celebrate or not aids activists used to agitate for faster fda approval of aids drugs now they demonstrate for faster drug distribution to africa and other impoverished countries but the complexities of these drugs just do not fit on a placard anymore in yet another strange juxtaposition nearly all the patients in the clinic especially the activists are beginning to lobby to get off their drugs for a while coasting on the accrued benefits in hopes of avoiding the worst of their toxicity robert must have made his peace by now with the single overriding law of pharmacotherapy that you never get something for nothing i looked at his chart last week he has tried testosterone and anabolic steroid hormones to regain his normal shape to no effect last year he had minor plastic surgery small plastic ovals implanted below the cheekbones to plump out his cheeks a little this year he had the implants taken out they just added more ridges to his sunken face robert is not at risk of dying of aids any time soon perhaps ever but if you were to meet him at a party or perhaps interview him for a job unless you are an unusually wise informed or nosy person you would come away filled with pity dismay and almost certainly an instinct to hire someone else as i waved at robert last week i was ushering juan into my office he is robert 's age robert 's height robert 's body type and as far as side effects he is one of the lucky ones a living advertisement for aids drugs once so sick he could barely walk juan is now a true adonis after four years on the same medications robert takes he has had no problems at all he looked at robert as they passed robert looked at him i looked at both of them we 're all waiting for the other shoe to drop
