 the stock market is doing great honest just look at a recent crop of mutual fund advertisements check out the ad in the dec 4 issue of barron 's the one with the eight guys in sweats doing push ups on a football field with the stern headline american discipline according to the ad the american century vista fund which invests heavily in technology stocks had a 12 month return of 1081 percent imagine that no sign here of all that doomsday claptrap about technology stocks then there is the t rowe price science technology fund which according to a recent ad in business week had a 12 month return of 384 percent the 19 billion fidelity aggressive growth fund up 493 percent according to a recent ad in this and other newspapers scudder 21st century growth up 406 percent a bear market what bear market the stock market may be in general decline but everything is still blooming in the land of mutual fund marketers their message this holiday season is simple try to remember the end of september or at least what your 12 month mutual fund returns were back then and try to forget that the standard poor 's 500 index is down 68 percent so far this year fund companies defend their advertisements by pointing to securities and exchange commission rules that require them to include in their performance advertising their 1  5  and 10 year returns through the end of a fund 's most recent quarter but cynthia m fornelli a senior adviser to the head of the sec 's investment management division said the agency was considering changes in its rules maybe it 's not enough to rely on the last quarter of performance numbers if something extraordinary happens in the interim that makes those numbers misleading ms fornelli said i would remind people that there is currently an anti fraud provision in our rules that may require such updating the national association of securities dealers which reviews fund ads to make sure that they comply with the sec rules and its own has issued two additional guidelines in 1999 it said that more performance data might be necessary if the fund 's performance suffers materially after the end of the most recent quarter an official said last week that the guideline was meant more for catastrophes like the impact of a currency devaluation on an emerging markets fund than for market corrections this year it added a recommendation if a fund 's recent performance was the result of its investment focus in an unusually 'hot industry or other factors that may not continue to exist the association said in a notice we believe members should include prominent cautionary language fidelity and american century note that in recent weeks they have added stronger caveats to the usual past performance is no guarantee of future results in their fine print current performance may be lower than performance stated the fidelity advertisement says t rowe price however disagrees with the nasd 's 1999 guideline the nasd notice is just a recommendation said jane white a spokeswoman we have discussed it with them at length and disagree with them we use the sec guideline because the markets have been down this year especially since september adjusting the one year returns through the date the ads actually appeared yields a bleak picture t rowe price science technology was down 129 percent american century vista was up 149 percent far below the triple digit gains in the ad scudder kemper 21st century growth was down 042 percent fidelity aggressive growth meanwhile was down 412 percent fidelity 's nov 20 ad also lists the fund 's top five star ranking from morningstar inc but try to catch a falling star by the time the ad appeared morningstar had downgraded the fund to four stars neal litvak president of fidelity 's retail marketing division regretted the disparity that would not be my preference to have that happen he said since then he said fidelity ads besides adding stronger caveats have moved away from emphasizing individual funds we 're trying now to modify those performance ads so they show a wider range of products mr litvak said they show small numbers as well as big numbers at least fidelity t rowe price scudder kemper and american century include fine print then there is dow jones publisher of the wall street journal and barron 's in several recent ads in the journal the company promotes its dow jones industrial average and the 19 different companies and exchanges that sell mutual funds and other products tracking the average for which dow jones collects licensing fees the ad calls the average an unbeatable equation with an extraordinary return and encourages investors to contact your financial sales professional the prominently displayed numbers including a 2522 percent one year return are impressive but the ad has no fine print that says when the return was posted when the ad appeared on dec 4 the dow was down 57 percent over the previous 52 weeks if you guessed that the advertised return was through the end of september you would be wrong it was from the 1999 calendar year because it is not a fund company dow jones is not subject to the same regulatory standards but besides using a favorable period to calculate returns mercer bullard a former lawyer for the sec 's investment management division said the ad neglected to take into account the fund fees that would reduce performance mr bullard who now runs fund democracy a fund shareholder advocacy group said that if he was still at the sec i would refer it to an enforcement liaison he said that while it would not be easy to establish the sec 's jurisdiction in the sec 's favor this is a very misleading ad richard tofel a dow jones spokesman said that despite its note to call one 's financial adviser the ad was not truly aimed at individuals the ad is soliciting people to offer such funds not people to invest in such funds he said pointing out that the message at the bottom of the ad invites investment companies to arrange licensing some fund companies show more current results in a recent ad warburg pincus listed its capital appreciation fund with a 452 percent one year return through sept 30 next to that number displayed as prominently was the year to date return through october it was 419 percent a glimpse of reality in mutual fund fantasia
