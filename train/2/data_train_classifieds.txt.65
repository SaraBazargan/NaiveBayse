 the government argued today that it was perfectly legal to hold an american citizen in custody without filing charges against him and without giving him access to a lawyer paul j mcnulty the united states attorney for the eastern district of virginia made the argument in connection with yaser esam hamdi who was born in louisiana raised in saudi arabia and captured on the battlefield in afghanistan mr hamdi was held in guantanamo bay cuba and transferred to the naval brig in norfolk va in april after the authorities confirmed that he had been born in the united states a lower court ruled that mr hamdi could have unfettered access to a court appointed public defender but the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit has twice prevented that in papers filed today mr mcnulty challenged the lower court ruling saying that it is well settled that the military has the authority to capture and detain individuals whom it has determined are enemy combatants and that such combatants have no right of access to counsel to challenge their detention such people he said can be detained for the duration of the conflict and their american citizenship is not relevant mr mcnulty quoted a 1956 appellate decision that said a petitioner 's american citizenship does not confer upon him any constitutional rights not accorded any other belligerent under the laws of war mr mcnulty said the courts had no business interfering with the decision of the military and the president regarding enemy combatants in addition he said the lower court 's order to allow mr hamdi unfettered access to a lawyer jeopardizes compelling national security interests in two ways first he said it is likely to interfere with if not irreparably harm the military 's ongoing efforts to gather intelligence that may help protect the homefront from further attacks second he said terrorists have trained their adherents to pass concealed messages through unwitting intermediaries the court appointed public defender frank w dunham jr is to respond to these arguments on thursday mr dunham has argued before that mr hamdi is entitled to representation and should be charged if he is to be detained so far judge robert g doumar of federal district court in norfolk has sided with him in another development a federal grand jury in virginia made slight alterations today in the indictment of zacarias moussaoui the only person charged in the sept 11 terrorist attacks by dropping charges dealing with crop dusting equipment and by expanding the number of countries in which he is said to have worked the so called superseding indictment issued today by the grand jury in alexandria va left in place the six major terrorism charges against mr moussaoui who is acting as his own trial lawyer the indictment was made public this evening and federal prosecutors did not return phone calls to explain why the grand jury had sought the new indictment which replaces an indictment issued last december defense lawyers who have been assigned to assist mr moussaoui said the only significant change in the indictment might be the addition of malaysia singapore and indonesia to the list of countries cited where al qaeda operated
