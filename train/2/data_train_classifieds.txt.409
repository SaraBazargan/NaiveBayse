 until recently this hilltop village considered itself simple but modern now the villagers wonder if they are rolling backward in time a nearly three week israeli blockade has prevented them from leaving town by car except for medical emergencies we are back to the donkey misada abdel rahman srour principal of the elementary school said today there has been no delivery of gas in almost a month so many villagers are cooking over open fires the grocery shelves are sparsely filled so some are going into the fields to pick their dinner and with the health clinic closed because the doctor can not get into their town they have resorted to home remedies and to prayer we could pretend it 's an adventure on a desert island i guess but this little island is in a sea of settlements said sahid samha a palestinian government worker who has been unable to get to his office in 20 days nine miles west of ramallah janiya is a relatively isolated village of about 950 residents that is indeed bordered by jewish settlements on three sides the strict blockade which followed months of less stringent restrictions on movement has seemed a baffling punishment to the villagers janiya claims no martyrs to the recent uprising and is relatively low key politically villagers just assumed that the settlers did n't want them on the roads their children have taken to climbing the village fence and yelling into the wind at the settlers cars that travel freely below palestine yes israel no a group of 9 year old boys shouted in high voices today as third grade girls giggled beside them hiding their faces in the aprons of their pin striped pinafore uniforms janiya has been under palestinian civil control since last year but it remains under the security control of the israelis whose soldiers were positioned today at its outskirts some sat in armored personnel carriers others leaned on cement cubes drinking orange juice out of liter cartons it is total siege here one young soldier said except in cases of illness or pregnancy and there are suddenly a lot of sick and pregnant people in this town villagers say that janiya is known locally and rather precisely as the land of the 102 springs it is unusually green for a west bank town with leafy almond trees and fields of sage and relatively prosperous with daewoos and subarus in the driveways of terraced stone houses for many years the town has enjoyed nearly full employment most of its men worked inside israel or in the neighboring settlements but that came to an abrupt halt after the violence broke out last fall suddenly because of israeli security restrictions to prevent violence and terrorism most of the men were jobless and they began loitering in the rocky streets during the day wondering what to do with themselves it is painful for the men said mr samha who temporarily joined the unemployed after the blockade prevented him from going to work they feel they are without purpose and that they are without value for the last five years naji nidal 33 and a father of four has worked in talmon a neighboring jewish settlement he was a carpenter who built kitchen cabinets at a good clip and earned about 1000 a month now he earns zero he said except for occasional pennies from selling the sage and tomatoes that he grows his israeli boss he said recently called and told him that he was worth five of the romanian workers who had replaced him if you go to a man named yisrael in talmon and ask him who is naji he will tell you that i am the hard working palestinian mr nidal said he had confidence in me he sent me inside their houses with no suspicions at all several nights ago mr nidal 's 2 year old daughter asil upturned a pot of boiling tea burning her chubby little leg mr nidal threw her in his car and nervously approached the israeli checkpoint he said the soldiers signaled for him to turn around it was a tense night in which there had been some shooting on the road mr nidal said that he tried to tell them of his daughter 's injury but he was too nervous to insist that they let him through today asil 's leg was in bad shape red raw and oozing pus flies hovered over her wound her father said he had applied some cream to it and that he expected he would be able to take her to a hospital someday soon by showing her leg to the soldiers mr nidal probably could have passed through the checkpoint but it was clear that he felt defeated by his initial attempt almost everyone in the village has a litany of woes and they are recited more with depression than with anger to most the town 's misery is encapsulated by the death of a 29 year old woman in late january it was a month after she had given birth by caesarian section and she was suffering complications the israeli army said that her death had nothing to do with the way she was handled at the checkpoint but villagers insist that she was delayed so long that by the time she got to the hospital it was too late this is the son of the woman who died mr samha said placing his hands on a 9 year old boy 's shoulders wearing a fish themed back pack the boy froze with the attention he whispered i do n't know how she died in the half empty grocery store which has run out of such staples as flour sugar eggs and chicken ali abu sheikha explained how he got to work until restrictions were tightened a young chemistry teacher who worked in a town 4 miles away he was forced to take an 18 mile roundabout trek by foot and by taxi but a few weeks ago the back roads were blocked too and he gave up only two of the janiya elementary school 's seven teachers live in the village between them they have divided the 128 students and solicited volunteers they have shortened the school day and eliminated sports and arts classes but they said that it would be difficult to control their young students even if they were fully staffed they ca n't concentrate the principal said they want to leave so they can throw stones at the settlers a spokeswoman for the israeli army contacted this afternoon said at first that janiya was not under any kind of restrictions there is no closure at all on that village she said she was urged to check further later this evening lt col olivier rafowicz a senior army spokesman confirmed that the village had been encircled for several weeks as part of general security measures in the ramallah area he said that there was no particular threats from janiya itself and colonel rafowicz added the encirclement will be released it was in fact lifted already a little while ago they can pass with their cars now and so on facing international and internal criticism for tightening restrictions on palestinian movement inside the west bank prime minister ariel sharon said tonight that he would lift internal closures in the west bank where security considerations allow it
