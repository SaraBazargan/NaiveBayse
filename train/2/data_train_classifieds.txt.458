 here 's a conversational icebreaker for those interminable hours that you may be spending in airport lounges as this summer of endless flight delays grinds on did you know that 10 bolivian bolivianos got you 34 bulgarian levs at the money changing counters yesterday how about that cyprus pound one for 162 or that indonesian rupiah 9100 for 1 today this sort of detailed foreign exchange information which i guarantee will instantly trump any unwelcome lounge colloquies on the mind numbing subject of someone else 's frequent flier miles used to be somewhat inconvenient to obtain with any precision and convenience but smart international business travelers have recently been discovering a web site that offers current foreign exchange data in exhaustive detail it 's wwwoandacom extensively revamped last spring by the oanda corporation an internet company that was spun off four years ago by olsen associates the swiss econometrics firm oandacom 's most useful feature is called the fx for foreign exchange cheat sheet which allows a user to find a current exchange rate by clicking on one currency and comparing it with any of 173 other world currencies the chart can be printed out you also can instantly find out what the historical exchange rates have been for any of those currencies growing numbers of business people are making multi destination international trips when they come home they confront the headaches of filing an expense account that needs to figure say how much that 400000 lira a night hotel room in milan actually cost answer 194 yesterday 187 just 60 days ago being a business traveler it was always kind of a nightmare to figure out the exchange rates especially if you did n't do your expenses right away said timothy kelly oanda 's chief executive you 'd be 'what the heck was the rate two weeks ago or a month ago when i had a thousand dollars of expenses in milan and some more in frankfurt paris and london it could get a little hairy hairy even for the beetle brows in the accounting department by the way those fluctuations can total 10 or 20 percent during an extended trip abroad he said on extended trips abroad a 10 percent differential can add up to real money it 's a matter of not shortchanging yourself and not overcharging your company oanda said that its currency converter technology was licensed by 13000 clients many of whom use it on their own web sites among them are travel and airline sites and even retail merchants who can rig their online catalogs with oanda 's software to instantly display prices in various currencies incidentally i am one of those travelers for whom even the simplest permutations of foreign exchange remain invincibly unfathomable in a long conversation the other day mr kelly managed to keep my attention when he told me that oanda is about to join up with thomas cook ltd the travel and foreign exchange services company to offer an online service for ordering foreign cash and having it sent quickly to your home this way you can have a modest stash of local currency in your pocket when you hit the foreign airport some banks and travel service companies already offer similar foreign cash delivery but the oanda site had 25 million hits in june and has about four million users according to webtrends an internet traffic measurement concern that 's a lot of potential customers who might be persuaded to push a little button and order cash mr kelly suggested is n't it dangerous to send cash through the mail i asked him nothing that would dissuade us from doing this business mr kelly replied he said that the cash would be sent either by priority mail or for an extra charge by express or overnight shipping in envelopes that do n't advertise the fact that they contain loot the outer envelope is of course the generic delivery service envelope he said it does n't have a big emblazoned logo like oanda the currency site which would basically be a steal me sticker having thus reassured me on a simple financial point mr kelly began to outline oanda 's ambitious plans to one day soon become an online trading interface for individuals and a business to business exchange service linking importers and exporters and others within three to six months time we will be a fully integrated fx trading hub he said adding that oanda 's online penetration traction and velocity will aid in the establishment of a new electronic marketplace for foreign exchange obviously there are people including some reporters who can fathom the implications of this me i was listening politely and taking notes while at the same time fiddling on my computer with the oanda web site i can report that it has many entertaining travel features besides those currency conversion charts for example you can click on temperature and convert fahrenheit to celsius and vice versa another chart has shoe size comparisons american british and continental men 's and women 's another has those old back of the composition book favorites like charts for converting from meters to miles and grams to ounces incidentally did you know that a british hectare contains 10763910416709722 square feet
