 pelswick eggert loves drawing cartoons playing sports and drumming up trouble with his friends he 's smart gutsy and can always find the perfect pointed barb with which to slay his adversaries in other words he is your typical 13 year old boy  except for the fact that he is confined to a wheelchair and has limited use of his arms he 's just a normal kid who wants to be treated like everyone else and he 's not afraid to go after what he wants said john callahan the cartoonist and author who created pelswick a weekly animated series that has its premiere on tuesday at 8 pm on nickelodeon like his protagonist mr callahan is quadriplegic the result of an automobile accident that left him paralyzed at 21 over the years so many kids have come up to me and asked me about being in a wheelchair little questions like 'do you sleep in a wheelchair 'is your dog paralyzed he said the best thing to do is to be straightforward still pelswick is not that totally autobiographical he insisted he 's a little removed from me with the support of his family espeically his grandmother pelswick overcomes obstacles like being nominated for student body president against his wishes and dealing with his nemesis boyd scullarzo who focuses on psychological torture and humiliation all of which is fuel for mr callahan 's fire there are just so many ideas he said i ca n't show them all in 13 episodes even though adults at many of the networks he approached about pelswick flinched when faced with its subject matter mr callahan thinks the show 's intended audience gets his point i remember one of the comments made by a kid who had seen an episode he recalled he said 'i like pelswick because he 's in a wheel chair and does n't care he was right kathryn shattuck
