 bernie mac still recalls the moment when he was 5 that he decided to become a comedian mr mac who grew up in a poor neighborhood on the south side of chicago said he walked in from the backyard one evening and saw his mother sitting on a chair weeping i climbed on my mother 's lap and i kept saying 'why are you crying said mr mac star of a successful new fox comedy series and she kept saying 'nothing nothing and the more she hugged me the more emotional i got and i was crying too the tv was on and it was 'the ed sullivan show and bill cosby was doing a routine about finding snakes in the bathroom i did n't know what he was talking about but my mother began to laugh she was laughing and crying and i began to laugh i was wiping the tears from her face and i said 'you know what that 's what i 'm going to be just like that guy on tv i told my mom 'you ai n't never going to have to cry again mr mac 44 has spent most of his life trying to make people laugh first at school then on the train in chicago and at parks and finally at clubs and as part of the original kings of comedy tour in 1997 that tour before mostly black audiences sold out across the country and became the subject of a spike lee documentary the tour also featured steve harvey d l hughley and cedric the entertainer mr mac is now seeking to make a leap into national television with the bernie mac show a fictional series that seeks to tap into a persona that is alternately likable witty profane and blunt the half hour show which received mixed reviews has come in no 2 to nbc 's west wing on wednesday night from 9 to 9 30 gail berman president of entertainment at the fox broadcasting company said the network picked up the show immediately after a pitch by mr mac and the writer and executive producer larry wilmore who was also the executive producer of the pj 's an animated series about an urban housing project that ran for two seasons on fox and one on wb mr mac 's series has a strong point of view on a family ms berman said it 's not middle of the road i do n't think it would be appropriate for nbc or abc shows of ours like 'married with children 'malcolm in the middle 'titus 'the simpsons are family shows with unusual points of view mr mac plays a childless married comedian who reluctantly takes in his sister 's three youngsters after she is sent to drug rehabilitation mr mac who is married and has a grown daughter said the show was partly based on reality he and his family took in a teenage niece and her daughter and a family friend cared for the children of her drug addicted sister i wanted to do something about parenting which has been part of my act for years mr mac said over breakfast at a pasadena hotel nowadays parents do n't want to be parents they want to be friends with the kids we always say we want to give our kids more than we ever had but more is not better my aunt her son is 2 years old he 's treated like a grown man 'come on please you have to eat something come on you 're talking to a baby 'you better eat kid or else my grandmother would just look at you she did n't say a word but we did whatever she wanted we were scared of that look the show 's most controversial element and fox executives are uneasy about it is its approach to child rearing the bernie mac character believes in old fashioned discipline and threats when the children misbehave at one point he threatens to bust the older child 's head till the white meat shows addressing the television audience mr mac says when i say i want to kill these kids you know what i mean he and fox executives defend the language saying no one believes he will actually do anything bernie is a chump ok mr mac said his bark is bigger than his bite you can see he 's soft bernie does not hit his kids mr mac said his grandfather used to reach for his belt when children misbehaved but did not use it we 'd beat ourselves up trying to get away he said the success of my comedy has been not being afraid to touch on subject matters or issues that everyone else is politically scared of mr mac said it 's a joke believe me i 'm not trying to hurt anybody he said his threats against the children were as empty as jackie gleason 's yelling to the moon alice gleason is one of his idols a review of the show by neil genzlinger in the new york times said it flirted with offensiveness in a way that is likely to overshadow its good points in the los angeles times a critic called the show bold creative and ferociously witty mr mac himself is flying high in his career although he has appeared in several movies his biggest and most high profile role is as a con man in the new steven soderbergh film ocean 's eleven which is to open on dec 7 mr soderbergh said he cast mr mac after seeing him in the kings of comedy film i thought he was hilarious mr soderbergh said i also thought he had something beyond the ability to do great stand up he said that although mr mac was untrained as an actor he was naturally gifted he listens when he 's performing he 's very intuitive and very sensitive to what 's happening in a scene and he has a very strong presence a natural one mr soderbergh said he has a lot of range i would n't hesitate to cast him in a drama mr mac said he drew his material from his own bleak background he was reared mostly by his mother and grandmother one brother died in infancy another died of a heart attack at 26 his mother died of cancer which she hid from the family when mr mac was 16 his closest friend was shot to death in 1985 by a girlfriend being a comedian is really about pain he said it 's about being able to reach where there 's nowhere else to go you never see a comedian who was born rich like you never see a boxer who grew up in beverly hills the hunger the drive the desire is not there
