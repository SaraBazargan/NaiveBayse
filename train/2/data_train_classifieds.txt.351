 when i tell people at parties that i am a nurse the question i often get is how on earth can you bear to empty bedpans i usually stop them short with this reply my patients are too sick to use bedpans i had never planned on nursing as a life long career but after a few years into it i realized i possessed a passion for working with very sick people and i took a job in the coronary intensive care unit at st vincent 's hospital in greenwich village i 've been there for 14 years now a typical day might start out quiet but it rarely stays that way suddenly a three star alarm reverberates in my well trained ear my eyes dart to the monitor and instead of normal heartbeats passing on the screen i see a wavy line indicating someone 's heart is about to stop panic comes close but then i tell myself i must remain calm even a moment of indecision can lead to severe harm or death to a patient as a team doctors and nurses we rush to the patient 's room and try to save him when the resuscitation effort is over there is n't much chance to bask in the knowledge that i assisted in saving a life or if the patient dies to grieve the loss and assist the family in their grief because my other patients need my attention once i entered a patient 's room after losing someone in a cardiac arrest and was greeted with where were you i asked you for a box of tissues an hour ago i wanted to say listen i just lost a patient but i realized he was scared and felt no control over the most basic functions of his existence my compassion overrode my irritation and i replied i 'm sorry you had to wait i 'll get your tissues right now my career has also led me on adventures outside the hospital one summer i worked as a volunteer in a clinic in north carolina that treated migrant workers from central america who were employed on the surrounding tobacco and potato farms they were hard workers and would n't take time out for illness or even to take medicine for their high blood pressure or diabetes in the evenings we would travel to the migrant camps and question the occupants about any symptoms they might have experienced this way we could catch a few people before they were too ill for help at the clinic a year later i traveled to tanzania in africa as a member of a medical team we saw up to 200 patients a day in old buildings left over from a mission as we drove up people lined the road and clapped they were so happy to have us there they kept repeating asanti sana which is swahili for thank you i saw many symptoms of malnutrition which included thyroid problems in young children and infants dehydrated because their mothers could n't produce milk to feed them two surgeons another nurse and i set up an operating room we hung our iv 's from the light fixtures and used the light of midafternoon along with two lamps to work by the high pain threshold of the people amazed me one man after we removed a hernia from his groin got off the table and walked to a truck full of people waiting for him surprisingly there were no postoperative infections many of the people we saw there complained of general aches and pains and we gave them aspirin and tylenol soon people were coming in asking for the pills we thought the news of our great drugs for treating pain had traveled but the interpreters informed us the people were using the pills as money to barter for goods and services we laughed at ourselves for thinking we could impose our culture on theirs
