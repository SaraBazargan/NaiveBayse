 poland 's political future became murkier today with more complete tallies from the election on sunday indicating that the clear victors the democratic left alliance of former communists will not be able to control parliament without a partner likely to make demands that could slow entry into the european union and to slash the budget deficit the democratic left is likely to have to strike at least an informal alliance if not an outright coalition with one of the right wing peasant parties whose overall strength in the elections showed the depth of discontent among poland 's peasant farmers over the agricultural reforms that would be necessary to gain membership in the union over all an electorate fearful of the future 16 percent unemployment and a growing budget deficit showed clear disillusionment with the results of just over a decade of democracy and capitalism turnout was low 46 percent and a huge majority of the votes actually cast went either to the former communists considered likely to keep afloat at least some deficit ridden state enterprises or to parties with a nostalgic vision of the peasant poland of old a strong roman catholic strain or a pronounced hankering for law and order the only bright spot for poland 's new urban middle class was the second place finish of a new pro business party civic platform led by defectors from several other major parties they received almost 13 percent of the vote eclipsing the established pro market forces around leszek balcerowicz whose party posted only 3 percent on sunday and will not sit in parliament civic platform supports budget cuts and the european union but its strong business constituency and staunch laissez faire views would make it a difficult partner for the democratic left partial but official election results issued this morning showed that the democratic left was the landslide winner but the alliance led by leszek miller received only 41 percent of the vote compared with earlier estimates of 44 percent and could be 12 seats short of a parliamentary majority mr miller 's most likely partner is the polish peasants party which took 89 percent of the vote and was the democratic left 's partner in a rather unhappy coalition from 1993 to 1997 the peasants party is opposed to the european union but less militantly so than the samoobrona or self defense party of angry farmers which garnered 10 percent mr miller gave no public hint of who he would tap as partner saying he preferred to wait for complete results on tuesday samoobrona and its leader andrzej lepper made their name by setting up highway blockades to protest the government 's farm policies two other right wing parties will enter parliament one is law and justice a new party focused heavily on attacking corruption and street crime election results indicated that it received 94 percent of the vote the other is the league of polish families a group with xenophobic leanings that campaigned on the slogan so that poland can be poland and took 76 percent the demise of solidarity was complete with 56 percent of the vote it will not get into parliament
