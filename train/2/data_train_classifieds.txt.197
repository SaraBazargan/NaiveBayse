 the accounting firm ernst young announced yesterday that it would stop selling information technology services to companies it audits and that it would no longer serve as internal accountant and external auditor at the same company the move by ernst young comes as several competitors are announcing new limits on the range of services they will provide to a client on sunday arthur andersen the accounting firm that audited the enron corporation announced that it was creating a special oversight board with broad powers to change how the firm does business kpmg and pricewaterhousecoopers both announced last week that they would support similar changes ernst young 's announcement leaves deloitte touche as the only big five accounting firm standing by the practice of providing consulting services to companies it audits in a statement last week deloitte acknowledged that its policy was perceived as a problem by investors but said the public interest would be served by lowering the level of hyperbole in the debate and carefully considering potential unintended consequences of any proposed reforms james s turley ernst young 's chief executive said in a conference call with reporters yesterday that it was important for the large accounting firms to adopt clear positions on the question of which services auditors can provide to clients investors regulators and lawmakers have been calling for a review of the many services accounting firms provide since the collapse of enron and its filing for bankruptcy protection enron 's auditor arthur andersen provided both consulting and audit services and also served at times as an internal and external auditor it 's obviously a challenging time for the profession mr turley said over the last few weeks it became very clear to me that several of us needed to stake out positions and just get on with things relative to the scope of services mr turley said he favored the creation of an independent disciplinary organization unrelated to the accounting industry 's trade association a proposal similar to one made last month by the chairman of the securities and exchange commission harvey l pitt but he also suggested that regulators create a crisis response team that would react to situations like enron 's bankruptcy filing by recommending rapid changes to accounting standards mr turley said that providing consulting services to companies audited by ernst young did not in fact create conflicts of interest and that a prohibition against doing so would probably not prevent an enron style implosion rather he said the public perception of a conflict had to be addressed in any event he said giving up technology consulting would not be a serious hardship because the firm sold its consulting business to cap gemini a european consulting firm in 2000 ernst young will however feel the effects of no longer serving as both internal and external accountants for its clients mr turley said from 20 to 25 clients receive both services and the internal audit work generates several hundred million dollars a year for the accounting firm ernst young would not disclose exactly how much it earns from clients where it is both internal and external auditor the firm could lose some clients when it changes its policies but it could just as easily pick up clients from other accounting firms making similar changes not to take such steps might keep the accounting industry from recovering its credibility mr turley warned that in turn could cause it to lose its best people the profession could become one where existing professionals do n't want to stay in it he said and students would not want to work as accountants the same concerns are behind an e mail message sent yesterday by james g castellano chairman of the american institute of certified public accountants to members of that organization mr castellano wrote that enron 's collapse has eroded our most important asset public confidence and reported that the association 's board had approved a resolution supporting measures similar to those adopted by ernst young andersen and others mr castellano also advised the group 's members that in the next few weeks the association would take out advertisements in national publications to try to restore confidence in the accounting profession and attract recruits the profession 's heightened visibility mr castellano wrote makes this an opportune time to convey our messages regarding its viability dynamism and high standards enron 's many strands accounting
