 it may have been an aversion to baseball or to politics or both but american television viewers displayed a rare hunger for their nightly ration of prime time network entertainment in the first week of the new television season which resulted in impressive to outstanding performances by a number of new network offerings as well as by several returning favorites the delay in starting the new television season pushed back from mid september to october by the olympic coverage on nbc may also have made viewers eager to rid themselves of repeats and get back to their network viewing habits whatever the reason the first week 's ratings indicate that as many as four or five new series may be on the way to hit status while two established shows the west wing on nbc and everybody loves raymond on cbs look as if they are about to emerge as challengers to the likes of er and friends as the top drama and comedy on television the west wing only in its second year was the most watched show of the week with a season premiere audience of 251 million raymond meanwhile had its biggest audience ever last week 22 million and followed that up with a second episode on monday seen by close to 20 million but it was the news for new series that had many network programmers considering cartwheels among the shows pulling in surprisingly big initial audiences were dark angel on fox ed on nbc and csi the district and even a much maligned comedy yes dear on cbs other new shows performed well though not quite as eye catchingly including gilmore girls on wb titans and deadline on nbc and that 's life and the fugitive on cbs that cbs has no fewer than five new shows off to strong starts with both of its better reviewed comedies bette and welcome to new york set to start up tonight is one indicator that it is the network with the most momentum cbs won the week in terms of most viewers with an average of 145 million but startlingly cbs even won the week among the audience that its competitors always say is the big one adults between the ages of 18 and 49 nbc was clearly hurt by losing its big thursday night to the vice presidential debate still this is the first time cbs has won a premiere week in that young adult category since 1991 at least part of the reason cbs may be doing better with younger viewers is the opportunity the network had to expose its roster of new series to the huge audience much of it young that watched survivor on cbs this summer the explanation for the strong performance of ed may have been similarly linked to mass promotional exposure during the olympics or it may have had something to do with getting some of the best reviews of any new show this season ed soared on sunday for nbc delivering the highest ratings for an nbc premiere on a sunday in six years that made it a sensational week for david letterman 's worldwide pants production company which also owns raymond the explanation for the initial success of dark angel is a bit less lofty in essence fox skipped out on the usual expectation that each broadcast network without a sports obligation carry the presidential debate so that dark angel could face off against baseball and the debate a result was hit numbers for the new action series from the director of titanic james cameron fox executives acknowledged that it would take time to see how well angel would fare against regular competition that may be true of all the new shows most of which used the less than avid interest in this year 's baseball playoffs to grab viewers in the first week usually the television season starts with a horde of new shows all jumping in at the same time this season because baseball has played on two networks many new shows have had a chance to get on the air less challenged by entertainment series and the news has not been universally good for new shows nbc 's comedy block from 8 to 9 on monday daddio and tucker is off to a dreadful start with tucker looking as if it may be the first show to wear a cancellation bull 's eye this season that woeful performance damaged deadline which fared reasonably well in its first try then fell back on monday abc 's friday night comedy lineup hugely promoted all summer barely stirred a ripple of interest last week with one new series the trouble with normal looking most troubled while another new comedy madigan men showed just a trace of life on fox freakylinks on friday struggled though the network liked its reach with teenagers and young adults but in the new season 's first week the disappointments were actually outnumbered by pleasant surprises and that has not happened since well nobody can remember the last time that happened
