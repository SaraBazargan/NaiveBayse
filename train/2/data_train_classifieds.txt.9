 the funny thing about the university of okoboji winter games has always been that there is no university this year there was no winter but the games must go on in sleet in snow and yes even in sunshine so instead of parking cars on smith 's bay where the ice this weekend was about 8 inches thick instead of the typical 40 organizers used a dirt lot on the shores of west lake okoboji a firebird was spotted with its top down the wild women of okoboji relay race replaced its obstacle course of snow angels and hockey pucks with a sand course culminating in each contestant 's hopping with an uncooked hot dog in her mouth the dog sled races were scrapped because it was too warm for the huskies participants in the freeze your fanny bike ride were seen sweating the polar bear jump into a hole in the frozen lake was never more popular four years ago with the wind chill factor it was 54 degrees below zero saturday it was 64 degrees above breaking records not just for the day previously 45 degrees in 1973 but the entire month of january 63 degrees 1981 normally it 's just miserable and the idiot people still come out said bob shaw 56 who helped start the winter games 22 years ago with a broom ball tournament to lure people out of hibernation i think a lot of it is just the magic of okoboji some people might call it stupidity okoboji which locals translate from an unspecified american indian tongue as beautiful lake or place of rest is the name of two lakes and a town in the so called iowa great lakes a resort area 100 miles east of sioux falls sd and 175 miles southwest of minneapolis the county 's population of 15000 swells to 150000 in summer the winter games is a chamber of commerce effort to bring the summer visitors and their wallets back it is a lemonade from lemons kind of enterprise the residents have a big frozen lake they have beer they make fun the centerpiece remains the broom ball men 's and powder puff divisions a hockey without skates sort of game played not with actual brooms they tend to break but with special wooden sticks that have a red plastic triangle on the bottom there is also slow pitch softball where the rules demand must slide on close plays given the ice fields sliding is also fairly common in football bowling and miniature golf with this year 's record breaking temperatures some of the drunker competitors also slid on their stomachs to celebrate victory or numb defeat 's agony we 're still waiting for espn said carole caviness who works for the chamber and has lived in the area 20 years before there were winter games there was the university of okoboji a figment of herman richter 's imagination that has over the decades raised millions of dollars for charity not to mention mr richter 's clothing store in neighboring milford and spread pennants and bumper stickers from the great wall of china to the south pole mr richter 57 who says he majored in a severely positive attitude at the university of okoboji and has his thumb perpetually up looked around his hometown in the early 1970 's and saw the makings of a great university beautiful campus fun people plenty of bars we 're missing one little piece classes he said well who cares the school motto where fun in life is your degree means that all who take part and enjoy themselves count as alumni joe theismann ronald mcdonald and former president george bush have received honorary degrees along with a golf cap and beach towel during visits to the campus plenty of tickets are available all on the 50 yard line front

year the bonfire was on land rather than on the lake and it was hot the games which take 44000 and 600 volunteers to put on and draw some 3000 people most from northwest iowa but a few from omaha chicago and even denver began friday afternoon with a bridge party and will end with a dance monday night this year instead of three layers of long underwear weston sharp of indianola south of des moines had on shorts a t shirt and sunglasses saturday between his wool hat and boots for a game of softball i 'd go water skiing right now if someone could put a boat out mr sharp said between the softball fields and the beer tent sat the elgersma clan a group of about a dozen families from primghar iowa about 45 miles from here who camp on the lake in summer and started coming back for the winter games five years ago the ice fishing shack that gives the children a place to warm up was largely empty as everyone sat on the 1970 's era upholstered couch and easy chairs arrayed on the ice in years past by the time the hot dogs were done roasting on the outdoor fire the buns would be frozen this year the only concern was whether the beer was cold enough it 's not as fun we do n't get to ride snowmobiles or anything complained sara bootsma 10 who wore short sleeves as she stood outside it 's better when it 's cold
