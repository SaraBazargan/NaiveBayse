association will begin voting in the next few days on the tentative deal reached on friday night between the pilots union and the carrier the nation 's second largest the vote will be conducted by

and job reductions beginning in 2005 pay would again increase by 46 percent a year and would regain 2002 levels by 2008 if approved by the union 's membership the provisions would take effect on dec 1 in a statement released after the agreement was reached glenn f tilton united 's chief executive said the deal provided solid evidence that the airline was making progress in its efforts to avoid bankruptcy mr tilton who joined ual in september from chevrontexaco said the unions were cooperating in an unprecedented manner mr whiteford said the package was meant to give united help as quickly as possible although mr tilton has said that a bankruptcy filing was not inevitable mr whiteford said the situation was urgent if this effort does n't go through i think it 's likely that barring some third party financing that we would have to look at an in court restructuring he said yesterday in an interview mr whiteford said the pilots understood the airline 's plight adding that as united 's highest paid union we have the most to gain by this company staying in business and the most to lose if this company goes out of business last month united 's pilots flight attendants and machinists said they would support 58 billion in concessions which the airline sought as part of its effort to secure a 18 billion government bailout specific pay cuts and other contract changes were left up to the individual unions whose members together hold about 55 percent of the company 's stock united based outside chicago has about 85000 employees talks between the airline and its mechanics are to resume this week said joe tiberi a spokesman for that union the international association of machinists he would not characterize how those talks are progressing the airline is also in negotiations with its flight attendants union a spokeswoman for the group was not available for comment yesterday like other major carriers united 's labor costs far exceed those of southwest airlines the leading low fare carrier united spends 467 cents per seat mile on labor the third highest rate in the industry compared with 307 cents at southwest according to an estimate from airlineforecast an industry consulting firm without concessions it projects labor costs at united are expected to pass 515 cents a mile in 2005 a united pilot flying the same boeing 737 aircraft used at southwest is now paid 244 an hour compared with 140 at southwest as part of the cutbacks analysts said they expected united to retire up to 50 more planes including about 20 boeing 747 400 jumbo jets at least a dozen boeing 767 200 's and its remaining boeing 737 200 aircraft mr whiteford of the pilots union acknowledged that there would be some reductions in fleet size saying we 've got to get leaner and meaner but declined to be more specific but he was critical of the stabilization board created in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks to oversee 10 billion in federal loan guarantees approved by congress to help the industry get back on its feet thus far only one application that of america west airlines has been approved by the board although a number of airlines have sought help mr whiteford said the board was unfairly requiring carriers to forecast industry conditions and guarantee a level of financial performance that might prove impossible given the uncertain state of air travel united last month revised its original application to include additional spending and job cuts even so some industry analysts predict that it has only a 50 50 chance of winning the board 's approval they should n't be into 'how competitive will you be five or six years from now mr whiteford said showing some irritation we have a network and assets and now we have proven that there is a coalition of all labor they should be interested in helping to stabilize the airline mr whiteford said the union planned to start a campaign in support of united 's application and would appeal to members of congress to support the application a spokeswoman for the board was not available for comment on sunday members of united 's management met with board officials last week and are expected to have further meetings this week kevin p mitchell president of the business travel coalition which represents corporations and business travelers agreed that the board was being overly demanding they have the ability to restructure the industry said mr mitchell whose group supports united 's application he said united 's viability depended on how swiftly it could pull together its recovery plan along with obtaining union concessions united also faces a 300 million interest payment to a german special purpose lender kfw on nov 17 the company is in talks with officials of the lender over whether the payment date can be extended two larger debt payments come up in december
