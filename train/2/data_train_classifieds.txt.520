 in his first address to the city council today mayor michael r bloomberg plans to call for dissolving local school boards in favor of mayoral control of the board of education and will propose several economic development projects for the city many of them outside lower manhattan his aides say the mayor who in his inaugural address called for elected officials and city agencies to follow his lead in cutting back their staffs and budgets will begin to outline how he is trimming 20 percent from the mayor 's office said people with knowledge of the speech he will also talk about other areas of government where he believes spending has gotten out of control one area apparently is tort claims mr bloomberg will hit upon broad themes of accountability discipline and optimism said his communications director william cunningham the point will be that the city is resilient and strong and back mr cunningham said he will talk about partnerships with the city council and the legislature he will talk about private public partnerships and long term projects among the projects that mr bloomberg is expected to allude to are economic development plans in lower and upper manhattan on randalls island and in boroughs besides manhattan mr bloomberg will also revisit a pet project he has envisioned a 311 telephone system that citizens could call with nonemergency concerns and be transferred to the appropriate city agency he wants to make government more user friendly for the citizenry mr cunningham said mr bloomberg has often talked about using technology to streamline and cheapen government functions mr bloomberg who in his inaugural address called for sacrifice in the face of a roughly 4 billion anticipated budget gap will continue to urge government to scale back while keeping its sights on things like the development of manhattan 's west side and the need to attract more conventions to the city but the mayor will probably save his strongest words for the subject of education an area he has zeroed in on from the moment he took office mr bloomberg has already made his case to legislators that he would like to see the board of education put under his control a goal the governor supports the legislature which must approve such a move has been open if guarded to his gestures
