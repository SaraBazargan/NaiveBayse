 runner up lives elizabeth berger senior bronx high school of science bronx 'it 's called garlic bread not garlic toast i say to her when the waiter walks away my mother looks at me blankly here in america we call it garlic bread she looks at me and laughs refusing to be brought down by the sarcasm and rudeness that she 's used to getting from me my parents go out to eat more than any two people i 've ever met and my mother still has n't mastered the art of ordering from a menu it 's strange to sit across from her because it 's like looking into a mirror of myself 35 years later the same uncontrollable curls and green eyes it 's not too bad a reflection my mom can be pretty when she sets her mind to it but usually she does n't it 's a strange feeling to know that you 're destined to take on the physical being of the person who makes you crazier than anyone else in the world my mother 's eyes have gone from laughing to troubled she twists her napkin i roll my eyes because it 's all a game she plays this is her way of forcing me to bring up a topic i do n't want to talk about that way when the screaming is over she can ask what are you so mad at me for you brought it up she is clever i would never deny that what 's wrong mom i ask oh nothing i was just thinking to myself really it 's just too bad about condoms did you know that they 're not 100 percent effective it 's just too bad about condoms i replay the words in my head who speaks like that i was prepared for almost all personal attacks but i was n't prepared for it 's just too bad about condoms in an instant i decide i wo n't let her control this game i will not give any extra information nor will i withhold any necessary information i will come out the winner i did know i start evenly most people do they write it on the box i sit back calmly and cross my arms she 's going over my words one by one but her face does n't even move i know it is the on the box part of my answer that is giving her trouble she 's trying to decide if i know because i like to read condom boxes in drugstores hear about them from friends or am having sex that is really what this conversation is about ask me you coward i silently will her i dare you she starts slowly so i was thinking i smile i 'm ready perhaps the reason that you and your boyfriend have been fighting lately is that you have desirous feelings for each other and um sometimes there 's tension she pauses pleased with herself nope i do n't think sexual i hit the word hard just to make her squirm tension is the problem everybody 's handling their 'desirous feelings just fine we both sit back this is exhausting something about my mother 's face tells me that i should stop this is what she wanted but she 's in over her head so i try and be funny i was showing him this ridiculous handout about 'sexual myths the other day did you know some people believe a girl ca n't get pregnant if she stands on her head while having sex this works my mom laughs a little i guess they think everything 's flowing in the opposite direction she says i guess people also think   she cuts me off and says in hurried voice listen the first time i got pregnant i had n't exactly planned for it your dad was going to write and i was going to act i saw myself becoming a star when i got pregnant i saw my dreams being destroyed so i told your father i did n't know if i wanted to have the baby i told my parents too everyone told me that it was my decision and that they 'd all support me i went to a doctor and she gave me a number to call for an abortion but i could n't call it 's funny to think that i almost did n't have my son it 's weird to think my mom has secrets god i bet you feel stupid you obviously made the wrong choice she smiles anyway i 'm telling you this so you know if you ever got yourself into a situation we 'd all be here for you we 'd get through it if you 'll excuse me i need to use a restroom she stands up i know it 's my turn look mom she raises her hand i 'm not asking for any true confessions here do n't tell me and she walks away so i sit there trying to figure out what just happened it is too much to absorb my mother who has on more than one occasion followed me down the block to make sure i was going where i claimed to be going just made an attempt to speak to me she spoke to me like a person all of a sudden i understood what i had n't got before it was n't fear that kept my mother from asking me directly if i was having sex it was respect and this amazes me she sits down and says maybe instead of seeing a movie you and jackie could do sample sat 's that could be fun yeah that would be great i say i was wondering if it would be possible for you to follow me around all day that way i wo n't have to make a single decision for myself could you pick out my clothes because deciding what to wear is getting overwhelming and just like that we 're back runner up what they were thinking amy papa junior blue valley north high school overland park kan amy papa kansas city mo july 6 2002 my photograph is actually of myself it may seem impossible to do but believe me it is not when i enrolled in a summer photography class at a local junior college i was not excited to say the least because i had already taken more than a few introductory courses at my high school but this assignment caught my attention find a moment that is irreversible when i approached my mom about getting my eyebrow pierced being the cool mom that she is she said 'for the sake of art you can setting up this shot was very difficult how to do it with me lying on the table the answer zoom in and angle the camera on my best friend ashley after i set up the shot on the tripod and attached the cable release it was time for my decisive moment i lay down a rush of emotions filled my body as i felt the needle poke through my eyebrow the shot the shot the shot i thought there was no turning back i now had a hole in my eyebrow
