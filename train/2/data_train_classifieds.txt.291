 a top adviser to gov george e pataki is also a lobbyist who has pressed the governor 's office for legislation in an unusual situation that critics of mr pataki and of new york 's lobbying practices say raises ethical concerns john f o'mara who once served as mr pataki 's chief utility regulator is a lawyer the governor has hired as his lead negotiator with new york 's indian tribes on their land claims against the state and their attempts to open casinos he also heads the panel that screens judicial nominees for mr pataki at the same time mr o'mara is lobbying the administration he formed a partnership in august with former senator alfonse m d'amato to lobby for a project sought by a central new york shopping mall developer the effort paid off as the project was included in the broad gambling law enacted last month that included approval for up to six indian casinos former representative bill paxon plays a similar though less direct dual role he lobbies in washington for mr pataki 's request for federal aid to recover from the world trade center attack and for the state university of new york an agency controlled by the governor at the same time he and his law firm represent the seneca indians in their casino and land claim talks with the governor 's office mr paxon has said that he is not directly involved in those negotiations though he played a role in lobbying the legislature on behalf of the senecas in favor of the gambling bill such arrangements violate no laws or regulations legal codes of ethics say that as long as a lawyer 's clients are aware of potential conflicts between them and waive any objections the lawyer is free to represent people whose interests may be opposed new york state 's lobbying law says nothing about conflicts of interest i 've looked into it thoroughly and there is no conflict mr o'mara said i have been very careful in my professional life to avoid any improprieties when there was any question i have gotten opinions from the state ethics commission in advance which i 've done several times but groups that press for more open government and more stringent ethics laws have long complained of the potential conflicts affecting lobbyists particularly those who pass through the revolving door between government and those who ask things of government those groups and some democrats say the situation of mr o'mara and mr paxon representing the governor while seeking things from the governor on behalf of paying clients is a disturbing wrinkle this is a new layer in the chronic conflict of interest problems in albany said rachel leon executive director of the new york chapter of common cause it just seems like simple basic ethics and common sense that you should n't be lobbying the governor at the same time you 're working for him critics say the arrangement raises the question of whether mr pataki can drive as hard a bargain as he should with a lobbyist who is also his representative i think it creates huge potential conflicts for the governor said blair horner legislative director for the new york public interest research group others have gone through the revolving door but o'mara is the doorway he 's both in and he 's out michael mckeon mr pataki 's communications director used an expletive to describe such remarks what you 're saying is you 're not questioning o'mara 's ethics you 're questioning the governor 's ethics he said he dismissed mr horner and ms leon as surrogates for the democrats saying that their criticism of the republican governor was the worst kind of politics attacking people 's integrity as for whether mr o'mara 's dual role gave him any particular advantage in dealing with mr pataki mr keon said the governor has no problem saying no to anybody mr o'mara is a longtime republican power a former district attorney and judge in chemung county who for more than two decades has been close to mr d'amato who was once the governor 's political mentor mr pataki appointed mr o'mara chairman of the state 's public service commission which regulates utilities from which he swept away much of the long standing system of utility monopolies before leaving it in 1998 niagara mohawk one of the utilities mr o'mara used to regulate retains him as a lobbyist in august mr o'mara and mr d'amato in a partnership called d and o consultants were hired by pyramid management group a part of the pyramid companies a developer of shopping malls and other projects which is based in syracuse pyramid 's primary owner robert congel is a major political contributor who since 1995 has given 94900 to the state republican party 15500 to mr pataki and large sums to several other candidates republican and democratic pyramid intends to build a 13 billion expansion of its carousel center mall in syracuse making it the largest mall in the country the plans call for a number of features like a sports complex and an aquarium that would make the mall as much amusement park and tourist destination as shopping center pyramid wanted the state to build inside the mall a high tech center to promote upstate tourism and to create a new upstate tourism council to be based there the center would resemble a theme park with scale models of various tourist spots and interactive computer displays the company hired mr o'mara and mr d'amato to lobby the pataki administration for the 25 million project and patricia lynch a former top aide to speaker sheldon silver to lobby the assembly the tourism center and council were included in the gambling bill along with other unrelated projects that might not have won passage on their own the legislature passed the bill last month and the governor signed it
