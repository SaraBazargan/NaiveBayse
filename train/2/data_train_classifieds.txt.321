 ask a south korean on the streets of this city what he or she thinks about president bush 's recent statements including north korea in a so called axis of evil and many will say they are shocked and even insulted probe a little further and despite the widespread feeling of offense many people here also say they agree with mr bush up to a point with the approach of mr bush 's first official visit to this country on tuesday few south koreans took direct issue with his characterization of north korea instead in numerous interviews people from all walks of life expressed chagrin that mr bush had shown so little delicacy in addressing a government that their own government has struggled to engage and they said they were worried that mr bush had made things worse this is the world of south korean public opinion in which few countries arouse such conflicted feelings as the united states and north korea put the two together and add some provocative language from an american president and feelings that seem mutually contradictory begin to surface the sunshine policy is generally accepted as the greatest achievement of the kim dae jung government said song kyung sang referring to mr kim 's diplomacy of engagement with the north but with that single remark bush seems like he is trying to destroy it mr song a 58 year old novelist added the fact that he would say such things without consulting koreans first is frankly an embarrassment to us another man of the same generation who was out enjoying the last day of the lunar new year holiday with his family expressed the same kind of shock but with a nuance basically i agree with what bush said said the man a corporate executive named lee bong hwan the way he said it though just was n't professional maybe this is the way people talk in america but in korea and in this part of the world it sounds a bit strange washington has a history here of building up resentments with what south koreans see as scant consultation followed by rash actions and statements in 1977 president jimmy carter announced during a visit that the united states should withdraw its 37000 troops from this country similarly koreans say they were surprised to learn after the fact that president bill clinton had come close to war with north korea in 1994 over the issue of nuclear weapons production we have talked about this quite a bit among ourselves and most of my friends think that bush 's comments were way too strong said june lee a 28 year old employee of an internet company personally i kind of agree with president bush we are giving aid to north korea all the time and getting nothing in return the comments were too strong and the timing was bad but in a way he is right ms lee 's comments touch upon a major fault line in opinion between washington and seoul if mr bush thinks the government of kim jong il is evil because of its international missile sales many south koreans think the north evil mostly for its human rights abuses and for something more insidious the drag of a desperately poor north korea on this country 's astounding recent economic progress remarkably although seoul is just 30 miles from the world 's most heavily armed border and though north and south korea remain technically at war few south koreans perceive their neighbor as quite such a threat as washington says it is instead many south koreans dread the effects that helping north korea might have on their prosperity yet although a growing sense of being had by north korea has steadily eroded the president 's popularity most koreans say the sunshine policy should continue after the presidential election in december we do n't really know the inner workings of the sunshine policy said kim sang bum 34 a computer company employee interviewed in a downtown park but over all even though we complain about it everyone knows that it is a good thing
