 new york city 's budget shortfall could top 6 billion which would make it more than a billion dollars worse than mayor michael r bloomberg projected according to a report issued yesterday by comptroller william c thompson jr mr thompson also stated that much of the state and federal assistance that mr bloomberg was seeking to help close the deficit in the year beginning july 1 was not likely to occur warning that the city could fall 456 million short of its target in that area if that were to happen mr bloomberg would have to try to carry out most of his contingency plan which calls for 500 million in further budget cuts that he has described in the past as onerous and painful the contingency plan would cut school aid further shrink the size of the police department more eliminate fire companies from eight firehouses that currently hold two each reduce garbage pickups and lay off workers washington and albany must now stand up and realize that new york city is not crying wolf and that we need additional help mr thompson said in a statement mayor bloomberg puts the budget deficit at nearly 5 billion and has repeatedly expressed optimism that he will get the state and federal help he seeks the mayor 's aides said yesterday that they believed their projections would hold while we stand by the accuracy of our analysis the comptroller 's report reminds of the severity of the city 's fiscal problems said jordan barowitz a spokesman for the mayor mr bloomberg a republican wants to close the deficit by borrowing cutting services and getting help from washington albany and the unions the city council which is overwhelmingly democratic and must pass the budget in june wants to raise the income tax and to restore a commuter tax on people who work in the city but live elsewhere mr thompson one of two citywide elected democrats calls for restoring the commuter tax but not for raising the income tax in a speech last month he said that other tax increases are not the preferred course and were unlikely to be approved in albany the comptroller 's report says that the budget gap will grow for two basic reasons the city will take in less in taxes than the mayor expects because the economy will be slow to recover and the city will need to spend more than it expects on overtime pension costs labor contracts public assistance and legal judgments the report cast doubt on the mayor 's contingency plan it is unlikely that the city can achieve all of these savings given that some elements are unlikely to be approved by the city council or are programmatically undesirable it said
