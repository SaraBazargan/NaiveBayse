 three years after the city brought managed care to its jails and gave one hospital a set fee to care for the roughly 17000 inmates at the rikers island jail complex and the manhattan detention center the initiative has been quietly abandoned and the city appears set to return to the system it once derided as too costly and inefficient the city 's effort to contain costs and improve care at the jails which was built around a three year 342 million deal with st barnabas hospital in the bronx had been plagued by disputes over the city 's role in monitoring the care provided as well as a continuing criminal investigation into possible negligence by the hospital earlier this year st barnabas announced that it would not seek to renew its contract when it expires next february in april though the city began to solicit proposals for a new contract and the payment system it proposes is strikingly similar to the fee for service plan it had sought to overhaul under the old system the city reimbursed the medical provider for each inmate 's care and also paid for each inmate 's hospital visits without limit a system that it said led to excessive hospital visits related security risks and rising costs inmates made almost 10700 hospital visits a year when montefiore medical center held the contract often for minor ailments that could have been treated at the jails city officials said four medical providers including st vincent 's hospital in manhattan are presenting bids this week for a new contract which is likely to be the largest jail care contract in the country two other providers are bidding for a smaller part of the contract ernesto marrero the executive director of correctional health services the city unit that oversees jail care and developed the new contract said that the new contract would incorporate the best of both models st barnabas 's on site treatment centers and the designated triage doctors who send only the sickest inmates to the hospital will remain he said but because the city will reimburse its new provider only for care that it gives it will be better able to monitor how money is spent mr marrero added that a plan in which payments were capped or capitated served a purpose by giving st barnabas an incentive to improve care in the jails by expanding preventive care and creating specialty clinics on site with that goal met he said it was time to moderate the approach mr marrero acknowledged that since the current contract allowed st barnabas to submit projected and not actual spending and staffing levels it was hard for the city to know exactly how much profit the hospital was making or how much care it was providing i like as much control as possible he said and a capitated plan does n't give me as much control as i would like but conflicts over the contract with st barnabas continue on tuesday st barnabas filed a lawsuit against the health and hospitals corporation the parent of correctional health services asserting its right to remove key pieces of medical equipment from the rikers island jail complex along with intellectual property like software systems the managed care contract did not specifically compensate st barnabas for these items which it now owns as a result the lawsuit states mr marrero said that in any multimillion dollar contract litigation was always brewing inmate advocates are delighted with the new plan and say they hope it will restore the humanity in jail care and the ideal of rikers as a laboratory in which to treat medical and social ills that whole ethic has been ripped to shreds and stomped on the floor by st barnabas said john boston director of the prisoners rights project for the legal aid society the central concept of giving the provider a bag of money and saying 'you can keep what you do n't spend has certainly been abandoned when the managed care contract began in january 1998 with st barnabas as the provider city officials hailed the new venture as a remedy for the problem of open ended costs luis r marcos director of the health and hospitals corporation said it would provide an incentive not to send patients to the hospital unnecessarily but within six months two inmates had died after delayed hospitalization and the manhattan district attorney opened an investigation into criminal negligence in the deaths emergency room doctors said that many inmates sent to the city hospitals showed serious signs of neglect an internal report done by the city showed that in its first year st barnabas was on a path to make 14 million in profit in part by spending far less on each inmate than it proposed to the city it would as the city tried to defend st barnabas 's performance several officials at correctional health services quit their jobs saying that medical neglect was going unchecked however st barnabas which has formed a for profit entity that is seeking national jail care contracts and recently began a promotional web site has defended its performance saying that it reversed a jail care system in decline the critics notwithstanding st barnabas hospital has done an exceptional job at rikers island as evidenced by new services reduced inmate mortality and the fact that its employees and systems are being sought for the next vendor said gerald mckelvey a hospital spokesman he added that the city 's oversight was archaic and obsolete from its inception and called the quality of health care that st barnabas inherited deplorable with the contract in its final months the city and st barnabas agree on almost nothing for example correctional health services recently found that in the last quarter of 1999 st barnabas failed to meet 12 of 30 performance benchmarks outlined in the contract including providing required levels of asthma care and hiv testing the agency fined st barnabas 60000 but the hospital is refusing to pay asserting that the city has refused to divulge how it came up with those findings next month the city will select its new jail care provider and has emphasized in its request for proposals that complete cooperation with its monitoring efforts is essential
