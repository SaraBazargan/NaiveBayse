 robert frank the photographer best known for the americans a book of 83 pictures of 1950 's america and pull my daisy a fictional film about the beat generation is a walking contradictor he speaks then he unspeaks he takes pictures then sometimes years later he scratches words into their surfaces drills holes through them or hangs them on a clothesline like wet socks and rephotographs them the macdowell colony here has given mr frank 77 this year 's edward macdowell medal for his outstanding contribution to photography thus has this consummate outsider been pulled inside a small circle of writers artists architects and composers who have won the medal in past years including philip roth ellsworth kelly i m pei chuck jones isamu noguchi eudora welty and aaron copland and he could n't do a thing about it frank unintentionally made himself into an exemplar or classic case when he produced the americans wrote w s di piero in the catalog for robert frank moving out a 1994 retrospective at the national gallery of art in washington in other words mr di piero wrote mr frank 's work from the 1950 's and in particular his sweetly melancholic view of america became a kind of historical shrine that was probably not how mr frank intended it he seems to have made a career of slipping his reputation finding and refinding outsider status in 1947 he moved from switzerland where he was born to the united states soon after he was hired as a fashion photographer by alexey brodovich the powerful art director of harper 's bazaar but he quickly got sick of the slickness of fashion photography and began traveling around the world peru bolivia france spain england and wales in 1954 he applied for a guggenheim fellowship to photograph america as an outsider his application said what i have in mind then is observation and record of what one naturalized american finds to see in the united states that signifies the kind of civilization born here and spreading elsewhere by the time critics finally warmed to the resulting work the americans mr frank decided he would rather be making films in 1959 he and the painter alfred leslie directed pull my daisy with a script by jack kerouac and starring the poets allen ginsberg gregory corso and peter orlovsky and the painters alice neel and larry rivers mr frank followed up in the 1960 's with the sin of jesus ok end here and me and my brother in the early 1970 's he made a photograph of strips of his movie film which he called goodbye mr brodovich i 'm leaving new york dec 23 1971 ok years after he had officially left the magazine and mr frank and his second wife the artist june leaf moved to nova scotia his photographs became more inward more autobiographical and he began scratching words into new and old pictures paradoxical desperate sounding phrases like look out for hope or hold still keep going but even in his most inward revelatory work he also appeared to be hiding my work forms a fabric with my life he once said enigmatically i can never get too far away from it the question on aug 18 was how would such a paradoxical man deal with such a straightforward event as medal day at macdowell mr frank had just flown in from switzerland and was sitting onstage with the television journalist robert macneil chairman of the board of the macdowell colony carter wiseman president cheryl young executive director david macy residential director and philip brookman a curator at the corcoran gallery in washington who has known mr frank for 20 years mr frank had dark circles under his eyes before presenting the medal mr brookman told a story about meeting mr frank for the first time in 1978 mr frank held a mirror up to mr brookman and asked do you like what you see mr brookman concluded from this that mr frank sees the camera as a mirror something that shows what he sees outside and what he feels inside mr brookman remembered that in the film me and my brother mr frank fantasized about a cameraless movie would n't it be fantastic if you did n't even have to have a piece of celluloid between you and what you saw if the eye were its own projector instead of its own camera but is mr frank really hoping for less distance between himself and the world if you listen to him speak in his german accented paradox laden english you have to wonder is his way of speaking a way of revealing or hiding is this his true mode of expression the way he really thinks or is it intentional his way of creating privacy and uncertainty or is this simply a foreigner still struggling a little with english as with mr frank 's friend the painter willem de kooning a master of both paint and aphorisms and a european emigre you just ca n't tell mr frank graciously accepted his award but then as if to set matters straight back pedaled furiously away from his laureled self this is like being a star he said so much has been said about me you have a pretty clear idea of who this guy is he was talking about himself in the third person did he mean that the words spoken about him were better than what he himself could have said or did he mean that it was useless for him to buck his public image he asked what am i doing here and there as if there were some other option then he went on to give proof that he is as he put it really an outsider he pointed out that he left switzerland for america in the 1940 's and in the 1970 's he left his adopted homeland for nova scotia but i do n't belong to canada he said quickly and in switzerland he said i am just a tourist then he seemed to disown all europe he said that he had just taken part in a large exhibition there it impressed me the way they spend money there he said and the disregard of the success of anything they show did he mean that the money was ill spent and that the work was no good or that europeans were willing to take a chance on something that might not succeed for a second mr frank seemed definitively to prefer the united states if i had n't left switzerland to come to america what i am i would not be he said this is a generous country he said then just as everyone was getting comfortable with his compliment he added but the passport can be changed then he softened but just for a moment i have never felt so strong what a wonderful country this is and what a price you have to pay to be an artist here they do n't give you nothing for nothing a triple negative mr frank prepared to leave the podium i do n't think that much i think about myself a lot then just as he was about to wrap up his acceptance speech he said he wanted to make a correction to mr brookman 's introduction mr frank said that he never said it would be wonderful to make a film without a camera or celluloid that he said was the actress in me and my brother improvising a line finally mr frank concluded it 's a good day for all of us but by the time he was asked for an interview he had changed his mind this is not a good day
