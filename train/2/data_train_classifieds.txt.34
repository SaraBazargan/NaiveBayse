 the government ratified an important united nations human rights treaty today even as its own rights record has continued to come under increasing international criticism and scrutiny the standing committee of the national people 's congress approved the international convention on economic social and cultural rights a day after the united nations high commissioner for human rights mary robinson visited china but the government 's brief official announcement suggested that it might hedge on a full commitment to the part of the treaty that is the biggest problem for china article 8 which proclaims the right to form and join free labor unions according to the new china news agency the lawmaking body agreed to assume the obligations prescribed in item 1 a of article 8 in line with provisions of china 's constitution trade union law and labor law the law recognizes just one union which is state sanctioned and prohibits the formation of independent groups the constitution does not recognize the right to strike china has jailed dozens of people for independent labor activity on the one hand this is a big step forward mike jendrzejczyk of human rights watch in washington said but it makes it even more urgent now that china bring its labor laws into compliance with international labor laws and practices the chinese clearly hope that the ratification will sway two votes on march 19 a united nations human rights meeting in geneva will vote on whether to censure china for its continuing problems perhaps more important to china 's leaders in july the international olympic committee will decide whether to give beijing the 2008 summer games a spokesman for the high commissioner 's office in geneva jose diaz said it had not received the official documents from china and could not yet comment mr diaz said a clarification of the chinese position could take time although it is in their interest to do it quickly on tuesday ms robinson said a serious reservation on article 8 would be extremely disappointing the convention allows member countries to enter reservations on treaty clauses indicating that such parts will not be followed united nations officials said it was not clear whether china was planning to enter a reservation to the union clause or if it was merely signaling its intent to interpret the clause still ms robinson said the ratification would be enormously important legally and psychologically for china providing a real tool and a framework for progress in rights because it mandates periodic united nations evaluations of china 's record including its labor practices the convention 's goals include safe work places free compulsory primary education and equal pay for women members are subject to periodic united nations inspections even if china does not register a reservation the treaty gives countries fairly wide discretion in carrying out its terms the article states that no restrictions may be placed on the right to organize other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others this week china indicated it was not close to signing what is considered in the west to be a more important convention the accord the convention on civil and political rights enshrines rights like universal suffrage freedom of association and freedom to live where one chooses
