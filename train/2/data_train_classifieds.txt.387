 the seattle mariners have 26 victories this season but none of them include their local ratings triumphs in prime time over dramas and comedies like west wing frasier the seattle radio shrink who would not know where safeco field is and survivor playing in a popular new ballpark before a well heeled populace and featuring a group of likable players that includes the hitter known as ichiro the mariners are the top rated team in major league baseball far higher than the yankees mets dodgers or cubs their 157 cable rating on fox sports northwest is 69 percent better than the 93 rating for the no 2 team the cleveland indians the city stops for a game said tracy dolgin president of fox sports net which includes fox sports northwest among its 21 regional affiliates the only equivalent is the packers in green bay remarkably although the seattle market is less than one quarter the size of new york mariners games are drawing more households a game than the mets or yankees the mariners are in essence a daily reality series starring lou piniella as the wise former hell raiser from tampa fla ichiro suzuki as the mysterious lovable superstar hitter whose utterances in japanese are examined for their profundity and ruben sierra as an odysseus like character returned from his travels with his batting skills restored the mariners are as real as mtv 's osbournes they live at safeco field which is about the same size as the house ozzy et famille inhabit in beverly hills calif the mariners deftly wield bats that are swung ozzy once ate bats that fly we used to get pretty good ratings when people tuned in to see how badly they could screw up said dave niehaus who has called nearly all mariners games on radio or television since their creation in 1977 the mariners ratings potency was on vivid display last tuesday when they lost to toronto 4 1 the game rated a 161 or 265204 households the broadcast network program closest to it frasier produced a 136 on the local nbc station last wednesday the mariners rallied in the bottom of the 10th inning to beat the blue jays 5 4 the game generated a 191 rating which equals 314950 households nbc 's west wing its closest pursuer was 68 percent behind with an 116 locally on that night in the new york metropolitan area the giants mets game on the msg network received a 21 rating or 154782 households which was dwarfed in its time period by a 162 for west wing and a 169 for law order on the local nbc station one of the highest rated mariners games of this season on april 17 against oakland produced a 192 locally the no 2 program law order drew a meager 96 each seattle market rating point equals 16472 cable households regardless of the time the mariners play they invariably win their time slot when they played the yankees in new york on may 5 a 10 am starting time in the pacific time zone the game chalked up a 172 fox sport northwest is paying dearly to carry the mariners a new deal that began last season paid the team 37 million one of the steepest payments in baseball the previous year the fee was 18 million the cable channel carries 107 games a broadcast channel kiro tv is showing 35 at least a good thing happened when we paid this dolgin said they invested it in the club exactly why the mariners are such a dominant television attraction is not a feat of magic merely of alchemy the team except for losing years in 1998 and 1999 has been improving enough to weather losing randy johnson ken griffey jr and alex rodriguez and it got well in time for the opening of safeco field in mid 1999 then seemed to be touched by fairy dust when suzuki joined the team last season suzuki 's stellar rookie season was the main engine for the 59 percent rise in last season 's ratings there 's a huge japanese american population here said mark shuken general manager of fox sports northwest which sold a package of home games to japan 's nhk network because of suzuki and is working on a deal to beam games to hawaii the team does not break out the demographics of its japanese japanese american or asian american fan base about half of its fans come from outside king county where seattle is located and where 10 percent of the population is asian we work with japanese travel companies now howard lincoln the chairman of the mariners said until this started when the typical japanese tourist thought of going to the us it was san francisco or los angeles now we 're getting a huge number of japanese tourists and the reason is the seattle broadcasts and the mariners have become the baseball team of the northwest with games also seen in portland ore and vancouver british columbia they have no baseball competition to the north and nothing to the east for 500 miles rick burton the director of the warsaw sports management center at the university of oregon said and there 's no team to the south until you get to san francisco their appeal has a really wide circle but even within its local circle the mariners have the advantage of being in a less cluttered market than new york which has one of the wealthiest populations in the country with the seahawks and supersonics there are only three major league teams in seattle but the market is strongly collegiate with the washington huskies and washington state cougars it 's been huskies town not a seahawks town rodney fort an economics professor at washington state in pullman said when you go to husky stadium you see that they expect the rose bowl but now with the mariners renown surpassing anything the entertainer danny kaye and his partners could have envisioned when they acquired the expansion franchise in 1976 lincoln said the mariners are the most popular team in the region because we play every day bigger than the huskies football team which won the 2001 rose bowl lincoln could be partly right compare the mariners 157 average to some of last year 's huskies games on abc the local rating when the huskies played michigan last sept 8 was a 147 the oct 13 game at ucla rated a mere 71 while a nov 17 washington washington state game matchup produced a 197 seattle is a wonderfully supportive sports town gary barta the senior associate athletic director at washington said given their success it 's no surprise the mariners are getting the support they 're getting and that support especially on television would be the envy of george steinbrenner the principal owner of the yankees on his new yes network still without a deal with cablevision and its three million households the games are getting a 22 rating or 160623 homes on that score the mariners own the yankees
