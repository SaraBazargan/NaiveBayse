 as the red ink flows in a somewhat hidden manner the nasdaq 100 is setting new standards for a price earnings ratio by a major index the index is now trading at 811 times the combined earnings of the companies in the index the surge in the price earnings ratio means stocks in the nasdaq 100 are now exceptionally expensive on the basis of the companies ability to actually make money the ratio which had never been above 165 before this year reflects the fact that many nasdaq companies are reporting huge losses for 2000 when their financial results are analyzed using generally accepted accounting principles known as gaap that trend has been obscured however because many companies adjust the numbers in ways that make profits appear to be rising the disparity between the pro forma headlines that companies emphasize in their news releases and the gaap numbers has grown enormously over the past month and a half said thomas coleman the head of research and risk management for aequilibrium investments a london based money management firm the price earnings ratio is based on the earnings or losses of each company in the index for the most recently reported 12 months those numbers are weighted according to the relative weight of each company in the index which includes 100 of the largest companies traded on the nasdaq market the rapid rise in the price earnings ratio which stood at 127 at the end of december does not reflect any significant change in the price of the stocks in the index since the end of the year the nasdaq 100 stock index ended last week at 226177 down 34 percent for 2001 it is down 519 percent since it peaked in march when the price earnings ratio was 165 a fraction of the current ratio had earnings stayed the same the price earnings ratio would be less than half the 165 level instead the soaring price earnings ratio reflects big losses being posted for the fourth quarter of last year by a number of companies in contrast to profits or much smaller losses for the same quarter of 1999 overall profits of the companies in the index are down 90 percent since the index peaked the nosedive in profits is tied to write offs the largest of which appears to come from excite home the cable internet company which took a 46 billion hit other nasdaq 100 companies that took large write offs included amazoncom yahoo and cnet most nasdaq 100 companies have persuaded analysts to make their estimates on earnings numbers that exclude certain costs although the excluded costs vary from company to company most of the big losses being reported this year are in the areas that are not included in the pro forma or adjusted earnings that the companies want investors to focus on in some cases those losses may not reflect underlying problems for example many companies now take large charges when they make acquisitions to write off the value of acquired research and development work such write offs presumably do not represent a real evaluation of the value of the companies being acquired and as such are routinely ignored by many analysts similarly companies that acquire other companies using the so called purchase method of accounting often end up putting a large value for intangible assets on their balance sheets which current accounting rules require be amortized over up to 40 years the exact amount amortized during any year may have no relationship to the real value of the acquired company so those numbers are also usually ignored those losses are higher for the nasdaq 100 this year because a number of them made large acquisitions and because some chose to take the write offs very rapidly thereby putting them behind them for example i2 technologies an internet software company acquired aspect development another software company last year and chose to amortize the intangible assets over just three years the result was that it took a 772 million charge in the final quarter more than twice the company 's revenues for the quarter but many of the biggest write offs this year represent losses that are quite real excite home 's 46 billion write off for example represented its decision to quit some businesses for which it had paid large sums but now realized had no future it also includes losses on investments in other companies whose share prices have collapsed similarly yahoo took a write down of 163 million for losses on its investments and amazoncom wrote down its investments in other companies by 155 million and wrote down the value of companies it had acquired by 184 million none of those losses were included in the earnings numbers the companies had highlighted if the cumulative write offs become much larger in coming quarters the nasdaq 100 could find itself with net losses leaving it with no price earnings ratio at all that would be a remarkable situation for an index that includes major companies the last time the dow jones industrial average showed a net annual loss for its companies was in 1933 at the bottom of the great depression the standard poor 's 500 index has never had a period with net losses for all the companies
