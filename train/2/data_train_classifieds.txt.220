 one morning last week my friend sherri and i went shopping in one of those unfamiliar neighborhoods where low slung anonymous warehouses have loading docks and blank windows we were looking for a wholesale restaurant supply store but all the winding streets looked interchangeable except for a few discreet signs like allied fastener corp and cubbies unlimited is n't this the third time we 've passed american pallet i asked as i turned left onto east industry court and look there 's window rama again sherri said we were lost in a light industrial zone this is a cautionary tale this is what can happen if you are the sort of disorganized person who plans a really big luncheon at your home to celebrate your daughter 's bat mitzvah then leaves all the details until the week before the party then blithely decides to run a zillion errands during the final harrowing days when you should be concentrating instead on moving the furniture to a neighbor 's garage i had hoped to buy all my last minute party supplies online without leaving my desk and certainly without wandering around the outer reaches of east industry court and to be fair if i had stuck to the original list i could have done a week 's work in one morning it took only a few hours in fact to knock off the first few items on my list 1 coffee i ordered five pounds from zabar 's wwwzabarscom for 598 a pound even though i skimped by choosing the cheapest shipping option the order arrived within 48 hours 2 beverages for kids in various non carpet staining colors a day after i placed the order wwwpeapod com delivered sprite ginger ale seltzer and other clear liquids at supermarket prices i paid a delivery fee of 395 discounted by 1 for a late evening delivery time during a specified two hour period so i did not have to carry 11 heavy plastic bags from the store to the car to the house delivery is a heftier 995 for orders under 75 3 florists supplies like wet foam 150 per brick and wire 99 cents for a 10 yard spool to make centerpieces i ordered from afloralcom with standard shipping they arrived in three business days 4 glow in the dark necklaces which i learned fall into a category known as glow novelties the jewelry comes in such child pleasing variants as earrings rings and even bunny ears after comparing the prices of such party purveyors as chemlite com glostickscom and epartyunlimitedcom i settled on wwwaccessoriespalacecom luckily i phoned to place the order the owner craig weil told me that the bracelet necklace combo sets three pack glowsticks were out of stock but after he checked with his supplier then called me back to say he could get them in time i placed an order for six boxes of 24 three packs at 15 a box and four dozen pairs of glowing earrings at 720 per dozen and to meet the site 's 75 per order minimum i asked him to throw in some eerie glow in the dark mouthpieces in assorted colors 780 per dozen that should be a real treat to see in action those early successes emboldened me especially after i realized that in a pinch i could even turn to amazon com for a 55 cup farberware stainless steel coffee urn 14999 or to bedbathandbeyondcom for the smaller 36 cup model 11999 i could even have a folding metal coat rack delivered to the door 109 at organize everythingcom here is where i went overboard item no 5 on my list said innocuously enough plastic or paper plates but although i quickly found big selections at such sites as www 1partysuppliesandfavorscom and 4yourpartycom and www birthdayexpresscom i could n't bring myself to buy them maybe it was the unappetizing descriptions like solid color partyware which did n't sound like something on which i would like to put food could i afford to use china instead it was a far more appetizing possibility but i had already priced and rejected the possibility of rental china which at about 60 cents a plate seemed too dear likewise rental flatware at 65 cents apiece but when i searched for restaurant suppliers online i found promising leads like acemartcom and gandgequipmentcom which listed real plates for sale at near rental prices the headquarters of one company premium supply was in deer park ny about a half hour drive from my house if i picked up the dishes myself i figured i could even avoid the shipping charges when i phoned the toll free number to inquire i learned that premium supply welcomed walk ins between 9 and 5 lucky too because its web site would not allow me to place an order online armed with door to door driving directions from mapquestcom sherri and i set off to find the dishes but now as i passed the midland manufacturing company yet again i was getting desperate try making a right at the next corner she said as we approached grand boulevard i did and suddenly as if in a dream premium supply appeared on the left inside the store was jampacked with aisles of merchandise like enormous whisks that would not be out of place in the land of the giants the sort of huge heavy duty cone shaped soup strainer you dream of when you are trying to remove the boiled out vegetables from stock and millions of the disposable cartons in which chinese takeout food gets packed but i learned that the selection featured online was very different from the actual merchandise in the store for instance the basic wide rimmed white china plates i sought were out of stock bad but it turned out that there were plenty of narrow rimmed plates fine and in one corner packed willy nilly in nondescript cardboard boxes that reached to the ceiling i rooted around the close out merchandise to find treasure a trove of simple white coffee cups that i could get for 52 cents apiece by the time my car was loaded with all the booty i had also scored cake plates for 576 cents apiece nice heavy forks for 36 cents apiece and matching spoons for 24 cents apiece sherri bought the fine mesh soup strainer 49 an item i expect to covet for the rest of my life then i drove past american pallet a few more times finally found the road to the highway and arrived home congratulating myself on having nine days left until the party with nothing to do but rearrange furniture and hire a band online shopper e mail slatalla nytimescom
