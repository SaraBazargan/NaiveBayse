 the budget gap for the state university of new york 's hospitals has ballooned to 230 million about 13 percent of suny 's operating budget but the university is not asking for any state subsidies to close that gap according to the university 's budget request for next year which was released yesterday the university plans to borrow from the state to cover the gap as it has for the last two years while it continues to try to solve the problem university officials said h carl mccall the state comptroller has expressed concern that if suny does not press the governor and the legislature for money to close the gap the university may have to raise tuition or reduce the amount of money spent on instruction so far however the university has relied largely on borrowing to close the gap suny is seeking a 18 billion operating budget for its 30 state operated and statutory colleges next year a 132 million increase or 75 percent the university has turned to consultants at pricewaterhousecoopers for advice on how the gap might be closed but the consultants concluded earlier this year that the gap could not be closed by the hospitals themselves edward f cox a suny trustee and chairman of the board 's finance and administration committee said that suny had sought to give its hospitals more flexibility to compete with private hospitals and bring in more revenue unfortunately there has been no reaction from the political community he said so we have this problem there is not much more we can do as trustees the rest of the budget message was generally more upbeat of the 132 million budget increase suny is seeking 42 million is for contractual increases for faculty and staff it is also asking for 50 million for new initiatives including 40 million to improve quality and 5 million to help colleges that are struggling to shift their missions brian t stenson suny 's vice chancellor for finance and business said yesterday at a meeting of the finance and administration committee that suny would like to change its financial structure so the operating budget of the university does not depend on the payments of the hospitals suny officials say their problems stem from the state 's requirement that suny 's medical centers in stony brook brooklyn and syracuse pay 116 million a year to cover fringe benefits for their employees a sum they were once able to pay but can no longer afford because of belt tightening brought about by the growth of managed care instead of paying the money directly to the state the hospitals are supposed to pay the money to suny if the hospitals fall short as they have for several years suny must scramble to cover the shortfall in any way it can two years ago the hospitals paid 39 million of the 116 million assessment leaving a 77 million gap last year they paid that 77 million plus 2 million of the next 116 million assessment they entered the current fiscal year with a 114 million bill from last year on top of the 116 million they owe for this year mr stenson said that suny did not know what the hospitals would be able to pay this year the state has not always asked the hospitals to cover employee benefits in the 1980 's the state subsidized the hospitals which serve as teaching hospitals for medical students and provide care for the indigent in 1990 the state stopped paying the subsidy two years later it asked the hospitals which then had financial surpluses to share their bounty but changes in the economics of health care in recent years have turned surpluses into red ink for many hospitals including suny 's john clarkson deputy director for fiscal research and policy analysis in the comptroller 's office said that the university could not continue to roll the obligation over year after year eventually they 'll run out of room to borrow he said
