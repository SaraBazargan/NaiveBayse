 frank skala was driving down bell boulevard on his way to early mass on sept 1 when he saw it a 1000 pound bull lying in the street its horns tail and hind legs severed it lay in front of uncle jack 's steakhouse a neighborhood restaurant my first thought was 'somebody killed the bull said mr skala a local resident then he wondered how the perpetrators had gotten it to that spot it must have been an awfully strong force to move that there he said after all the bull was a 6 foot by 4 foot cast iron statue that had been bolted to the sidewalk in front of the restaurant on aug 23 william degel the owner of uncle jack 's paid 10000 for it it was symbol of power he said now if you look at it it looks dead he and some of his workers dragged the red orange statue back to the sidewalk he has vowed to repair and reinstall it this time on top of a large granite pedestal designed to withstand vandalistic assaults from the denizens of what he called the boulevard 's rowdy late night pub scene it has n't been easy a local ironworker offered to mend the bull free then changed his mind and said it would cost 1100 mr degel declined that offer another welder has offered to take the bull away for repair this weekend mr degel said that in the bull 's short public life it had already become a landmark people from all over were coming over and taking pictures of the bull sitting their children on it and taking pictures he said about two dozen local residents have taken part in a contest to name the bull first prize is a steak dinner with champagne the leading entry is chopper the bull 's butchers are still at large police officer santo elardo of the 111th precinct said there were neither witnesses nor suspects but the bull itself is in trouble with the law after a resident complained about it three weeks ago to the city 's department of transportation inspectors found that the statue had been installed without a permit keith kalb a department spokesman said the restaurant was sent a notice of encroachment a violation that can result in a fine of 50 to 500 on receiving it mr degel will have 30 days to apply for a permit and satisfy inspectors that the bull is not a safety hazard mr degel expects to obtain the permit he said because the bull is harmless after that he added we 're going to have a resurrection of the beast jim o'grady
