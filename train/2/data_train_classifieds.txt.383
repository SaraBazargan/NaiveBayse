 the philippine president gloria macapagal arroyo paid a call today on her ousted predecessor joseph estrada in his jail cell two days after his supporters stormed her residence saying she wanted to check on mr estrada 's well being mrs arroyo agreed to provide him with an air conditioner and curtains but the visit also seemed calculated to mollify the former president 's partisans who exploded in fury after he was arrested last week on corruption charges they 've been brainwashed into hating mrs arroyo said in an interview afterward at the presidential palace i consider them as victims more than as assailants and that 's why i would like to reach out to them mrs arroyo said she planned to visit estrada supporters who were detained on tuesday after their march on the palace was repelled by soldiers in a fusillade of gunfire resulting in four deaths if i can visit as many of them as i can i would like to do that she said i am going there with an open heart it was the first time mrs arroyo had met mr estrada since she resigned from his cabinet six months ago after a bribery scandal engulfed the actor turned politician the ertswhile allies traded small gestures he expressed sympathy for the stress she suffered during the palace siege she extended his visiting hours the contrast to the arrest of mr estrada at the hands of gun toting policemen was stark and it suggested that mrs arroyo was eager to mend fences with poor filipinos who are among his strongest backers and were greatly angered by his treatment i want to move on mrs arroyo said even as she relished her recent victory in the extreme sport that is philippine politics moving on might be difficult although the streets of manila were calm for a second day the capital remains in the state of rebellion mrs arroyo declared on tuesday to round up opposition leaders whom she accused of instigating the assault seven of those people remain free including an outspoken senator miriam defensor santiago who protested that mrs arroyo had actually instituted a state of virtual martial law senator santiago brandished a pistol at a news conference threatening to use it if the police tried to arrest her mrs arroyo said she planned to lift the state of rebellion which grants the authorities the power to arrest suspects without a warrant on monday but she did not rule out a further crackdown if the leaders she described as power grabbers mounted another assault on her government if they attempt it again then we will hit them again and defeat them again she said business and church leaders applauded the president 's tough approach which they say prevented an unruly mob from setting off a national crisis but there is lingering uneasiness here and not just among mrs arroyo 's opponents about her use of the rather nebulous concept of rebellion to arrest political rivals there is a suspicion that the police could abuse this ambiguous law said randolf s david a political analyst mrs arroyo who kept a well thumbed copy of the constitution at her side during the interview said declaring a state of rebellion was a necessary political tool to prevent the country from sliding into chaos i had to run after the coup plotters the power grabbers she explained and you ca n't run after them unless you declare a state of rebellion and declare them as rebels it 's not a matter of emotion it 's a matter of a step that has to be taken so that i can enforce the law the government 's crackdown came less than two weeks before crucial legislative elections senator santiago filed a motion today demanding that the ballot be postponed because one opposition candidate jose ponce enrile was in prison while two others were the object of manhunts mrs arroyo dismissed suggestions that the election be delayed she said the politicians who fomented the insurrection were lagging in the polls and wanted to overthrow her as a way to cling to power considering that they came within a stone 's throw of succeeding mrs arroyo looked remarkably composed today she described how her security agents hustled her from room to room in malacanang palace early tuesday morning as a crowd of 40000 chanted down with gloria and battled with soldiers outside whenever she entered an open area she was asked to wear a bulletproof vest mrs arroyo is the daughter of a former president diosdado macapagal and lived in the palace as a child she said she knew hidden passages she could have used if the crowd had pierced the gates despite her popularity with many filipinos mrs arroyo 's claim to the presidency is fragile given the way she ascended to power from the vice presidency a populist uprising not unlike the one her soldiers just put down there will always be part of the population that does not regard her as a legitimate leader but today mrs arroyo got an endorsement from an unlikely source mr estrada who insists he is still the rightful president said to her in tagalog it 's a good thing our president is visiting us he did address me as that she said with a broad smile correction may 5 2001 saturday an article yesterday about a visit by the president of the philippines gloria macapagal arroyo to her jailed predecessor joseph estrada misstated the given name of a leading opposition politician who was detained this week after an unsuccessful uprising by mr estrada 's supporters he is juan ponce enrile not jose
