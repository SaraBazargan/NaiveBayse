 it was the night before christmas a few years ago the adults were larking at the bar and supper buffet in the dining room while the children were playing upstairs in a less trafficked corner i was admiring my host 's christmas tree when a little girl about 6 appeared we had both gone awol from the festivities hello i said what 's your name my new friend did not respond she stood with her hands pressed defiantly on her hips at her feet was a miss kitty book bag the tree is pretty do n't you think she shrugged nice dress i offered complimenting her crisp party frock she scratched behind her neck where the dress label was rubbing the little girl looked left she looked right then like a magician plucking a rabbit she pulled a tattered madras jersey shift from her bag and slipped it over her party dress she exhaled and seemed relieved this simple old dress like magic made her happy not all little girls like to doll up but then mom appeared take that dress off why do n't you like your beautiful new dress mother wondered the little girl very sorry said she did not know a few weeks later i went to paris to write about the couture collections it was the height of the late 1990 's go go gold rush people did not come to paris in those days to praise the simplicity of perfect made to order fashion but instead to snowboard hot dog style in an avalanche of haute designer metaphors and high jinks eliza dolittle at the moulin rouge pocahontas on the orient express something borrowed and something blue the marriage of wilma flintstone to marat sade some of the clothes were beautiful some were downright peculiar they were complex and conceptual suffice it to say there was nothing to wear to your local chapter of the voluntary simplicity movement from one fashion show extravaganza to the next and then on the return flight home the image of the little girl at the christmas party and her one perfect dress played prominently in my mind it was an entertaining jostle between a little girl 's simple comfort versus 1000 designer concoctions in a consumer society where more is always the new better enjoying one perfectly simple thing is nearly an act of courage when it is n't the response to necessity and when an adult tells you he or she is on a quest for one perfect thing dress shoe macaroni and cheese recipe it usually has more to do with a fetish than a new lease on walden pond but there is a spell of time when children are innocent shoppers choosing what they like rather than what they are told they need by peers and marketers bubbles balls stickers teddy bears balloons magic dresses these are some of children 's favorite things the simpler the object is the better after exhausting themselves to find the best and brightest toy what parent has not felt frustrated when a child plays with only the box there is a reason simple things are so compelling simpler toys leave room for a child to try out her own dreams and wishes explain the child experts t berry brazelton and joshua d sparrow authors of touchpoints three to six with simple toys a child feels ready to face her world of transitions without it she must rely on adults who ca n't always be there no matter how reliable they are the little girl 's dress at the christmas party was hardly couture although that would have pleased her mother it was a tattered madras shmatte and it was her talisman it empowered her and why not is n't every dress from the newest of the new to the oldest of the old meant to be some kind of hope on a hanger style william norwich the entertaining editor of the magazine is author of the coming molly and the magic dress
