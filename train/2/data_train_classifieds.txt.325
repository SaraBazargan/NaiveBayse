 new york will become the first state to require that nearly all nonviolent criminals who are drug addicts be offered treatment instead of jail time in an effort to sharply reduce both the number of repeat offenders clogging the courts and the population in the state 's prisons and jails many states including new york have offered pilot programs like this in certain courts but not on this scale and never statewide chief judge judith s kaye who has wide latitude to restructure the courts yesterday ordered them to start phasing in the program immediately it will be fully in place by 2003 judge kaye said the initiative would divert up to 10000 nonviolent criminals a year to addiction treatment a significant number in a state where 95000 people are behind bars it will not however apply to nonviolent offenders convicted under the state 's rockefeller era drug laws which sometimes result in longer sentences for people arrested with drugs than for rapists and murderers criminal justice experts and court officials noting that court required treatment has an average success rate of 70 percent said the initiative would reduce the number of people who repeatedly commit crimes like burglary and prostitution to support their addictions they predicted that the state 's inmate population would decrease by at least 10 percent once the program was in full force some experts said judge kaye 's order was a sign that the courts were evolving into a social service agency of last resort focusing on rehabilitation as well as on punishment the chief judge said the plan would deal not only with a criminal justice problem but also with ruined lives broken families neglected children ravaged communities judge kaye estimated that the initiative would save the government 500 million a year in prison foster care and mental health costs without requiring more beds in treatment programs to be eligible offenders will have to test positive for drugs and be willing to plead guilty they will be assigned to specially trained judges who will monitor their cases instead of going to jail the defendants will enter a rigorous treatment program that will generally last two years and they will submit to strict monitoring by court officials including continued drug tests if they relapse they will go to jail most likely receiving stiffer sentences than normally given now although that will be left to the judge 's discretion even when defendants choose to stand trial the judges and district attorneys will still have the discretion to refer them to drug treatment until trial if they are found not guilty in all likelihood treatment will be continued said a court spokesman david bookstaver the commission that researched the plan for judge kaye included drug treatment experts district attorneys judges and lawyers who were asked to study how the burdens on the court system could be eased without compromising public safety the chairman of the commission robert b fiske jr a former united states attorney in manhattan said at a news conference yesterday that the initiative was not soft on crime noting that it would not apply to violent criminals or those punished under the rockefeller laws the commission however urged the state legislature to give judges more flexibility under those drug sentencing laws criminal justice experts praised the initiative saying that it recognized the futility of punishing drug addicts only to have them commit more crimes later but some experts said it did not go far enough and might tempt some people who wanted treatment to plead guilty even if they had not committed a crime in an ideal society we would not create compulsion or overly strong incentives to plead guilty said charles d adler chairman of the criminal law committee of the new york city bar association there are other questions about how the program will be carried out it requires a vast apparatus within the courts to screen and track addicts and those difficulties the commission 's report notes are magnified in new york city where the number of drug addicts accused of crimes dwarfs the caseload in upstate cities over the last two decades drug related cases in new york state have increased by 400 percent the report said in new york city alone 75 percent of all people arrested tested positive for drugs and the rate of repeat offenses among nonviolent offenders who are addicts can be as high as 35 percent the commission said typically these defendants are arraigned and then sentenced by judges with no expertise in drug problems who may see more than 100 cases a day spending an average of 5 minutes on each according to court records the quickest way for judges to dispose of these cases is to sentence the defendants to jail leading to spiraling costs the state spends nearly 650 million a year to imprison drug offenders or 29000 a person at the same time the more than 1200 drug treatment centers in the state have available space substance abuse experts said and can expand as the courts provide more clients most of the treatment under this plan will be paid for by medicaid or public assistance programs and the plan 's cost about 1036 million a year will be more than offset by the savings state officials said it 's an approach that 's steeped in rationality and common sense said timothy murray who developed the nation 's first drug treatment court in miami in 1990 and is the director of program development for the bureau of justice assistance at the united states department of justice it 's astonishing to see the results when people go through court mandated treatment on average court mandated drug treatment programs around the country succeed for 70 percent of those enrolled in new york city 's pilot programs only 12 percent of the offenders who participated were arrested again compared with 35 percent of those who did not go through a program marilyn sanders 37 said the pilot drug court in brooklyn on which this system will be modeled transformed her life ms sanders who is from a middle class family said that she fell into drug abuse and poverty and that the courts took away her two children after finishing the court treatment program she became an aide for the office of court administration in brooklyn the life i am living now is so great and wonderful she said they gave me a chance to turn my life around but she said if you get this opportunity you 've got to be willing
