 the day after his inauguration president bush sat for an official portrait taken by a los angeles times photographer named paul morse what was a times photographer doing taking official white house photographs in some respects he was following in the footsteps of better known photographers like david hume kennerly who left journalism temporarily to work in gerald ford 's white house the problem was mr morse had not yet left journalism this is a pretty ridiculous conflict of interest said dean baquet the managing editor of the los angeles times and a former national editor of the new york times this was not even debatable some of mr baquet 's subordinates however had not seen it that way one of the deputy directors of photography had given mr morse permission to take the portrait for the president mr morse said he had sought the permission because he was concerned about the conflict of interest knowing we cover the white house but he noted he was a general assignment photographer who did sports and feature photography in los angeles not political coverage in washington he said he took the portrait to help out eric draper the former associated press campaign photographer who had just taken over as official white house photographer and he said i thought it was a big honor to be able to shoot that picture it took roughly four days for word of mr morse 's freelance work at the white house to reach mr baquet by that time the photographer had already taken pictures some of mr bush and some of his dog mr morse was preparing to take an official portrait of vice president dick cheney he called back to his office to make sure that this assignment too would be acceptable that was when larry armstrong the photography director told mr morse he would have to choose between the times and the white house mr morse decided not to take the cheney picture instead he flew home and resigned he started a new job at the white house last week but the echoes of mr baquet 's displeasure can still be heard in the los angeles newsroom where every photographer has been asked to report all freelance activity when some photographers questioned why the request applied to them alone mr baquet said he extended it to the entire newsroom felicity barringer
