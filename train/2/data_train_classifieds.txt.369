 the seattle mariners cruised through yankee stadium this week on a hot streak pitching and hitting well playing with a special energy they swept three games from the home team and in doing so they illuminated some of the yankees current problems some subtle some more glaring the yankees made 10 errors in four games their pitching has been ineffective and three of their star position players look uncomfortable center fielder bernie williams rejoined the yankees last week after being away from the team for 11 days and he is struggling to regain his timing going into thursday 's game with seattle williams was 28 for 57 with six home runs against the mariners left hander jamie moyer and yet williams constantly seemed off balance going 1 for 5 since rejoining the team he is 5 for 26 with a double and a homer it 's a strange feeling he said david justice slumped on the recent road trip going hitless in 22 at bats before emerging from that slump and now he is in another he has one hit in his past 16 at bats and is 3 for 20 on the homestand justice sat out wednesday 's game and manager joe torre chatted with him yesterday about the possibility of taking another day off probably tomorrow when the yankees face the oakland left hander barry zito shortstop derek jeter missed the last two weeks of spring training and opened the season on the disabled list because of a thigh strain and it is apparent in his movement that he is still impaired to some degree sometimes he runs the bases in measured strides rather than in his usual all out gallop and several times he has fallen while fielding grounders as he fights to maintain his balance torre acknowledged that jeter might have been hurt by his inability to do much training before the regular season began body control is a big part of what he does torre said his legs are such an important part of every position on the field pitchers without their legs have trouble doing what they need to do shortstops you have to pretty much be acrobatic torre said he thought jeter probably felt the lingering effects of his injury and is controlling his running a little bit picking and choosing his spots to go full speed jeter agreed maybe a little bit but i think i 'm running fine looking but no deal yankees general manager brian cashman would not comment on a published report that suggested alfonso soriano might be traded to cincinnati for second baseman pokey reese but other club officials said there was no chance that such a deal would be made the initial proposal was made by the reds one executive indicated and the yankees are not interested in making the swap just as soriano is beginning his major league career and reese a fifth year player is beginning to make big money the yankees have been checking on the availability of a right handed power reliever and to that end they are monitoring montreal 's ugueth urbina on the sideline christian parker who went on the disabled list with shoulder tendinitis after making just one start during the regular season stopped a throwing session this week he is sidelined indefinitely outfielder henry rodriguez stopped by yankee stadium yesterday as part of his rehabilitation schedule rodriguez hurt his back in spring training and will most likely begin a minor league assignment soon outfielder shane spencer is two weeks into his 20 day minor league rehabilitation assignment and is gradually playing better the yankees could activate spencer from the disabled list next week and use him against some left handed pitchers sharing time with the left handed hitting david justice and paul o'neill but the yankees also have the option of assigning spencer to class aaa columbus barring injuries they will probably be inclined to do that to get spencer regular playing time as he rebounds from the knee surgery he had last summer
