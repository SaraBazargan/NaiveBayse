 it is 12 30 pm and i am riding the stationary bicycle at the livingwell health club a moderately priced gym a stone 's throw from parliament in london 's smaller dinkier approximation of capitol hill this is prime time for exercise when urbanites everywhere spend their lunch hours crunching and toning to look as lean and hungry as urbanites everywhere are supposed to look but not at this gym on the treadmill next to me is a man in an old gray t shirt with his stomach hanging down over his too tight shorts and a face so red and sweaty that he looks like he might well not survive into the evening over at the free weights is a woman wobbly in a retro style leotard whose concept of reps is to heave one of the weights over her head let gravity pull it back to the ground and then rest for a while in the pool which is not divided into lanes because people do n't generally swim laps in it are several women of various shapes and sizes who do the breast stroke for a few minutes then they sit in the whirlpool then they go home when i joined the gym two years ago it was with a heavy heart i am all too familiar with new york health clubs the ones with the people elbowing you in aerobics class the peak hour time limits on the rowing machines all those scary fat free exercisers with their sports drinks and their weight belts and their puffing and pulse counting one of the gyms i went to had a sign up next to the pool to remind you not to viciously kick your fellow swimmers swimming laps is not a competitive sport it said but when i arrived at livingwell for my first session i was in for a shock although i had n't exercised in months and could only manage about 15 sit ups at a stretch that seemed to be at the high end of the spectrum among this particular crowd some of the members were presumably there for the purpose of getting into shape but the general definition of in shape seemed a loose and impressionistic one this is a gym i soon found where when you go to the buns and abs exercise class people actually compete to stand in the back of the room as far away from the mirrors as possible the reverse of the classic new york scenario where people secretly hope you will injure yourself so they can take your spot up front it is a gym where even at the busiest times there is always at least one empty stairmaster sometimes all of them are empty it is a gym where many of the members look as if they have never actually set foot inside a gym even when they are in fact inside there are gyms with less lackadaisical clientele in london i know gyms where young buff investment bankers in bicycle shorts sweat and strut as if they worked on wall street and were members of the new york health and racquet club but they are much fewer and farther between with a higher proportion of body conscious foreigners real britons it seems go to gyms like mine to the extent that they go at all if asked most britons would freely confess that they do n't care much about their buns or their abs they do n't enjoy admiring their aerobicized selves in full length mirrors there are no full length mirrors in the remarkably comfort free livingwell changing room anyway and in general they do n't want to give up the sort of habits that would upset the american surgeon general m ore than a quarter of them smoke if they eat a vegetable with their meat which is not always the case they are likely to smother it in butter and if they eat fish they are likely to eat it deep fried in batter with a generous helping of french fries on the side just as it is no surprise that many americans are clinically obese it is no surprise that by many standards britons are stunningly unhealthy and proud of it although they have a universal health care system and relatively high average life spans they also have a yen for scotch eggs deep fried hard boiled eggs wrapped in sausage and rolled in bread crumbs although they like to go for long walks in the rain they also spend an average of 25 hours a week watching television americans watch about 26 hours a week they enjoy baked beans on their baked potatoes and drink an average of 11 alcoholic drinks a week and while one in four will get cancer at some point in their lives they seem to spend a curiously small amount of time worrying about it only 11 percent of the population has private health insurance and the rest take potluck with the national health service a system that can be wonderful and can be atrocious and which does not provide regular physicals teeth do n't even think about it fluoride is an thorny political issue here many people regard it as an unwarranted governmental intrusion into private life and as a result only 10 percent of the population lives in an area where the drinking water is fluoridated by way of illustrating how the country 's dental health is improving the british dental association recently announced that only 13 percent of british adults have no teeth at all down from 28 percent in 1979 of those with one or more teeth though only 50 percent visit their dentists regularly on a recent trip back to new york i went with a friend to the reebok sports club on the upper west side a health club so bustling and so full of hard core exercisers that it makes the weight room at livingwell look like the physical therapy department in an orthopedic hospital while livingwell has a breakfast buffet that involves a couple of vats of generic cereal reebok has a full service cafe that sells health shakes made on the spot with fresh fruit while the shower room at livingwell consists of three showers that smell of mildew the shower room at reebok is a vast complex where each shower is connected to its own changing room complete with its own set of shampoos creams and the like there were no free treadmills but as i waited already agitated as i willed the man ahead of me to get off the machine i remembered the new york gym one friend belonged to some years ago in the heart of wall street and filled with junior bankers with little time to spare between deals if your equipment of choice was occupied you had to sign up at the front desk and wait for your turn to be announced over the loudspeaker there was something wonderfully apt about a disembodied voice intoning brent to the treadmill brent to the treadmill as each fledgling executive took his place in britain brent probably would n't wait for the treadmill he 'd go to the pub instead
