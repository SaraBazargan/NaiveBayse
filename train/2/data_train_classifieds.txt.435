 before sept 11 john m guillot had composed what seemed to many a song of no commercial value after that day however his song the world anthem seemed to many to be a soothing antidote and it was recorded by a 48 voice chorus with the prague studio symphony orchestra now as numerous groups work on programs to observe the anniversary of the terrorist attack the world anthem a high tech amalgam of the world 's 193 national anthems from the star spangled banner to china 's march of the volunteers to the vatican city 's hymn and pontifical march is being considered for inclusion in ceremonies by peace groups and television networks and at one point was even being considered by the white house in the meantime the anthem was played at a peace conference in dubrovnik croatia and at the peace corps 40th anniversary ceremony at arlington cemetery both in june it was also recorded on a cd by the united states air force band of the rockies for children of military personnel while mr guillot nurtured the anthem from its inception in 1996 the two minute song was actually composed by a computer program renowned for its ability to generate music in the styles of bach mozart and other famous composers i knew that i wanted this to be a validated process and one of the things i was concerned about was people 's perception of who is this guy that he thinks he can write a world anthem said mr guillot a composer and part time music producer during a recent interview at his home i did n't want people to say this is some guy 's interpretation of what the world anthem should be i wanted it to write itself it needed to be a song that was based on the observations and commonalities of all of the national anthems and thus began a mission that has consumed most of mr guillot 's spare time and money since 1996 when he was working as a project manager for a compilation cd of 186 world anthems for the 1996 summer olympics he remembered a time magazine cover he had seen three years earlier that showed a composite face of humanity representing all the cultures of the world i thought we can do this with music mr guillot recalled i knew it could be done i knew that musicologists use formula to analyze music but because of the immense size of the project i wanted to link up with a university or a lab that used computers from then until last september despite rejections and being told repeatedly that there was no commercial value in such a song mr guillot was undeterred even through four layoffs from various jobs he was forced to take out two loans totaling about 10000 he finally found help from prof david h cope who teaches music composition at the university of california at santa cruz when i e mailed him i thought he was going to tell me to go away mr guillot said but he was very kind professor cope who considers himself a musician first is also a computer programmer and has spent the past 22 years perfecting a program he first created in 1980 called experiments in musical intelligence the program composes music by analyzing a database that mr cope puts into the computer which then distills it and produces a new piece of music he has generated four professional recordings with the program professor cope recalled i was intrigued by the fact that john 's need seemed to merge with my program 's potential just perfectly it seemed natural that a computer program that operates in a manner that a mind does was perfect for that sort of unbiased approach to put the 193 world anthems into mr cope 's program mr guillot enlisted stephen bigger a nashville composer and musician with whom he had worked on the olympics cd to help him convert the anthems into a format that the computer would understand mr guillot also gathered all the lyrics which took about three months and sent them to mr cope who then spent several months rewriting the program and putting hyphens between every syllable of all the lyrics in order for the program to work correctly finally after months of preparation and listening to each of the world anthems several times mr cope ran the program several hundred times and in a matter of seconds received several hundred potential world anthems the process was repeated with the lyrics mr cope sent three candidates of each to mr guillot and together they picked what they thought were the best with the musical skeleton of an anthem mr guillot and his collaborator randy kartchner a music arranger in nashville developed an arranged version of the song 's essence after about six months by spring 2000 mr guillot had his anthem and continued his task of finding an interested patron then sept 11 happened j ed goodman a friend of mr guillot 's and the executive director and founder of the mindshare institute and foundation in fort collins colo a think tank that supports socially conscious ideas remembered mr guillot 's desire to create a world anthem mr goodman said what the 11th did was it opened the world 's mind to communication with each other in a positive way and this fit in very well with that the foundation provided a 50000 grant mindshare contacted ted king an entertainment consultant in los angeles my job was to take it from its basic form and create a richer more beautiful and more exciting piece of music said mr king who quickly rounded up 16 professional singers including a soloist aspen miller and the prague studio symphony orchestra we wanted to give it an international flavor a recording was made in one day through a broadband connection in a local studio that linked the symphony orchestra in prague and the singers in los angeles allowing them to perform as if they were all in one room and the world anthem came into being it now has its own web site where listeners can hear an excerpt of the piece wwwworldanthemorg the anthem does not sound like computer generated music it is simple enough that it can be marched to i 've heard it so many times but i still like it professor cope said i can listen to it and find it interesting in new ways that i had n't thought of before mr guillot now has a simple dream what i 'd like to see is some world renowned artist perform this
