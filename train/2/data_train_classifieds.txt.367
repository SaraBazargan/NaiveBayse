 anti taliban afghan fighters appeared stalled today in their drive to capture a complex of mountain caves held by osama bin laden loyalists and then begin a full scale search for him there on thursday anti taliban commanders said the fighters moved about two miles forward in a series of fierce skirmishes capturing several caves just above the valley floor and seizing ammunition and at least half a dozen toyota and datsun pickup trucks the favored transport of all afghan fighters but there was little engagement today the commanders conceded the fighters are backed by the eastern shura a government that has replaced taliban rule in the jalalabad area over the past month puffs of smoke along the ridge line less than a half mile from the eastern shura command post suggested that troops loyal to mr bin laden and his terror network al qaeda were using mortar rounds to probe the enemy 's positions by late afternoon several pickup trucks filled with anti taliban troops bounced back downhill along the dirt track away from the front our commander told us to leave to go where it 's safer a young soldier in one of the trucks said the uncertainties of war are particularly evident on this fluid battlefield which is less a front than a number of pockets of conflict sprawled across a river valley the valley leads up to the folds of sharp ridges and on to a horseshoe shaped mountain range whose snow capped peaks mark the pakistan border a picture of the fighting can only be pieced together from the translated cryptic and sometimes boastful remarks of local commanders this may help to explain reports from kabul throughout most of today quoting a northern alliance spokesman as saying that mr bin laden 's headquarters was captured and that the entire cave complex was controlled by anti taliban troops on the ground the reports proved baseless yesterday we captured two caves but we lost them today said a frontline commander hajji moussa even on thursday in the first flush of the advance commander moussa said the fighting would only get more difficult there are 10 to 12 more caves up the valley he said they can shoot from above when we attack them we ca n't get through al qaeda forces estimated by eastern shura commanders at little more than 2000 have the advantage of terrain uphill dug in positions and cave fortresses built with central intelligence agency aid during the war against the soviet occupation in the 1980 's from these positions they can shelter from bombing and artillery and fire down on attackers who must work their way up the steep slopes exposed to danger much of the time american warplanes including giant b 52 's have been heavily bombing the area for eight days and nights continuing today sending huge plumes of smoke higher up the mountains afghan commanders said four american special operations military advisers had arrived at the front on thursday and directed the bombing overnight the american interest is of course piqued by the possibility that mr bin laden could be hiding in the caves but his whereabouts are far from certain the senior eastern shura security chief hazarat ali said this evening that mr bin laden had been seen in the area just three days ago another more junior commander kahan mir claimed that his soldiers had spotted mr bin laden thursday morning riding a horse in the company of a number of bodyguards none of this could be confirmed al qaeda fighters believed to be mostly arabs chechens and pakistanis appeared unlikely to surrender easily without the option of switching allegiance to afghans they may have nowhere to go their radio communications in arabic sounded confident almost cocky at one point taunting their hunters to send us the international forces hit the road hit the road came one radio call directing mortar fire in an attempt to pinpoint the eastern shura soldiers you idiot you missed the red pickup
