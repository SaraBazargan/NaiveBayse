 q you wrote your book lucky man without a ghostwriter did you find that writing uses a different set of muscles than acting it 's not even a set of muscles it 's a completely different behavior the thing about performing as an actor is that there are all these artists and artisans everybody doing whatever their discipline is and it 's like this big river you show up you have a cup of coffee people put makeup on you and you can take a little time to figure out what everybody 's doing and what your direction is going to be within all of that with writing it 's like standing naked at the edge of a lake you wake up every day and try to figure out if you 've got the energy to cross it it sounds daunting did you hate it oh i loved it a lot there really is something about saying this is the way that i want to say this and no amount of lighting or background casting or art direction is going to change it in any way so is writing the future for you i think i 'll still be involved in television and film but probably more as a director or producer and potentially now as a writer i think that 's opened up to me in the sense that i have a belief that i could finish something that was a great part about the book finishing it so now i think when i say that would make a terrific pilot or this would make a terrific film i know that i can actually sit down and with a certain amount of you know agony i 'll get to the other end of it in the book you offer a pretty harsh indictment of the world of celebrity it 's not meant to be so much an indictment as a there but for the grace of god go i not that i did n't go some places that were very godless and very graceless but at some point clearly i made a decision that i was n't going to set up permanent housekeeping in this place that was n't connected to the rest of the world it was n't necessarily a virtuous act where i looked at things and chose humanity it was more i have n't got whatever it takes to pull that off bottom line is it 's a great ride it 's terrific to have financial independence it 's even more terrific to be able to express yourself creatively and to have it be an actual vocation but at the end of the day it 's all kind of silly i was trying to explain to my son sam i said you know when you 're over at your friend 's house and you say 'you pretend you 're this and i 'll pretend i 'm that that 's my job it 's terrific but it does n't mean that i have a solution for the afghanistan situation which as a celebrity you might be expected to have that 's what i 'm saying once you kind of give in to it you can really build a network of support for just about any venture when i met my wife tracy i was already kind of thinking about some of these issues and then very quickly after that my son was born and my father passed and then i was diagnosed with parkinson 's a real saving grace for me has been not wanting to sacrifice my canadian politeness it really has been a major part of the way i approach my success and the challenges of this part of my life i 'm still very aware of what the rules are it took me a long time to get used to the new york jaywalking thing you 've lived in new york for 12 years do you feel like a new yorker i do there is something about this city where we all know we 're in it together you can say sweeping things about new york versus los angeles that new york is n't monoindustrial it 's not all about the business and smog but i love its juxtapositions and interactions donald trump has to walk by the korean grocer you 're more likely to step on a new yorker 's foot than you are to step on the foot of an angeleno you 're more likely to bump into an angeleno 's car and then the only kind of discourse over that distance is a bullet which to me is not preferable to someone saying your mother is a whore like in new york i love that about the city how have you found life here different since 9 11 one of the difficult things about the book was that i was writing the last quarter of it around the time of 9 11 and there was this great urge to contextualize it i 'm really glad that i did n't because while there are connections just on the level of personal grief and coping with change i did n't think it would have been an appropriate correlation to make down the line tragedy is egalitarian it was one of those moments where everybody was brought to the same level briefly at least remember all those obituaries for the ironic and the trivial those all went by the wayside the trivial is right back with its cockroach like staying power and it 's got deeper roots david rakoff
