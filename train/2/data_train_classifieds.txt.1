 representative richard a gephardt 's push to win the endorsement of the afl cio which is important to his hopes of winning the democratic presidential nomination has been set back by his problems raising money and his low standing in some polls many union leaders say mr gephardt of missouri has far more individual union endorsements than any of the other eight democratic candidates but to win the labor federation 's endorsement he needs the backing of unions representing two thirds of its 13 million members two thirds is a very tough and high mountain to climb said gerald w mcentee chairman of the afl cio 's political committee and president of the american federation of state county and municipal employees my own judgment is that right now he does n't have two thirds can he reach the two thirds it 's a possibility but i think it 's very challenging and difficult securing the afl cio 's endorsement before the primaries could give mr gephardt a major leg up political experts say because it would place at his disposal hundreds of union campaign workers already assigned to congressional districts across the nation all nine democratic presidential candidates are scheduled to debate tuesday in chicago before the afl cio 's executive council the council will not consider an endorsement this week federation officials say but mr gephardt 's backers hope that he can win the group 's endorsement at a meeting in october he very much would like the afl cio endorsement said steven elmendorf a senior adviser to the gephardt campaign even if we do n't get the endorsement a majority of unions will endorse gephardt he added there 's zero chance that any other candidate is going to get endorsed by the afl many union leaders question whether mr gephardt can obtain the needed two thirds majority hurting his chances several union presidents say is that three of the nation 's largest and most politically active unions the state county and municipal employees the service employees international union and the american federation of teachers appear unlikely to endorse mr gephardt any time soon the state county and municipal employees are leaning toward senator john kerry of massachusetts while the service employees and teachers say they are not ready to decide because they are still polling their members those unions represent nearly a third of the afl cio 's membership nine unions including the international association of machinists and aerospace workers the international union of bricklayers and allied craftworkers and the seafarers international union have already endorsed mr gephardt the unions that have endorsed him represented slightly more than one million members and then mr gephardt received a highly important endorsement friday when the executive board of the teamsters union which has 14 million members voted to support him bret caldwell the teamsters communications director said the union 's president james p hoffa would officially announce the endorsement in detroit next saturday mr hoffa will fly with mr gephardt to iowa the site of the first caucus and new hampshire the site of the first primary to speak on mr gephardt 's behalf a longtime union political official who insisted on anonymity said from the beginning there have been two schools of thought in the labor movement the gephardt loyalists and the pragmatists the pragmatists have been asking the question from the beginning can he win there is a reluctance some of them are pulling back a little bit certainly the money thing did n't help only two candidates have ever received the federation 's endorsement before the primaries vice president al gore in 2000 and walter mondale then a former vice president in 1984 when the decision was made to endorse gore who was a sitting vice president with him facing just one challenger it was still very tough to get to two thirds said steve rosenthal the afl cio 's former political director among union leaders there is a consensus that mr gephardt has the best record on labor issues that is one reason so many union leaders were concerned about his lackluster fund raising he raised just 38 million in the second quarter talking about mr gephardt 's fund raising bruce s raynor president of the union of needletrades industrial and textile employees said i would be less concerned about that than the question of the ability of a candidate to defeat george bush working families need george bush to be defeated we need a viable candidate to do that
