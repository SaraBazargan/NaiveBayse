 the bargain hunters never bargained for this mutual fund managers who specialize in spotting undervalued stocks often relish market declines because they expect to find more companies trading at attractive prices but the current market swoon is proving deeply frustrating for even these so called value funds their biggest bets have performed much worse than expected hurting the funds returns and damaging their managers images as discerning stock pickers value managers reaped good returns in the past by scooping up stocks that had fallen out of favor but this year many of their choices have continued declining the main culprit is earnings prospects which have deteriorated sharply in the weak economy they have helped to drag down the standard poor 's 500 index by 29 percent through september hurting returns for nearly all types of stock funds if you 've been in equities it does n't matter what you 've owned in the past few months because there 's been nowhere to hide said bill nygren manager of the oakmark fund which takes a value approach but the lackluster returns of value funds have not resulted only from the general market decline funds have also made some spectacularly inopportune purchases recent accounting scandals have punished many value funds even though value managers are known for being cautious investors who thoroughly analyze financial statements worldcom and adelphia communications both of which filed for bankruptcy protection this year were owned by several large value funds both companies were held by the vanguard windsor fund which lost 202 percent of its value in the 12 months through sept 30 according to morningstar inc charles t freeman the manager of windsor declined to comment the pimco value fund was another large owner of worldcom and at the end of july the fund also had high exposure to other stocks that have fallen sharply in recent months including j p morgan chase and el paso the energy company the pimco fund was down 244 percent in the 12 months through sept 30 phil neugebauer a spokesman for pimco did not respond to calls seeking comment there is opportunity for value funds but investing is riskier for them than it was in the past said harold evensky the chairman of evensky brown katz a financial planning firm in coral gables fla there could be more shoes to drop in corporate america on average value funds investing in large companies lost 186 percent in the 12 months through sept 30 according to morningstar compared with a 217 percent decline for the s p 500 that slight outperformance may not be enough to convince investors to buy shares in an actively managed value fund rather than an s p 500 index fund in fact mr evensky said most value managers were finding it hard to beat value style exchange traded funds which track the equity markets the way indexed mutual funds do but trade throughout the day like stocks for example the ishares russell 1000 value index an exchange traded fund was down a less severe 186 percent for the 12 months through september and is far cheaper for individual investors than almost any value fund because of lower fees another exchange traded fund ishares s p midcap 400 barra value which focuses on medium sized companies was actually up 27 percent for the period value funds lead over growth funds has been shrinking of late in contrast to value funds growth funds focus more on the earnings power of a company than on whether the stock is cheap value funds have done markedly better for the last 12 months than growth funds large cap growth funds were down 209 percent for the 12 months through september but in the third quarter growth funds investing in large companies were actually down less than their large cap value funds 159 percent versus 182 percent dissatisfaction with value funds may be showing up in the tallies of money flowing in and out of funds after attracting nearly 50 billion of net inflows in the first five months of the year value funds had a 105 billion net outflow from june to august according to lipper a fund tracking firm in this brutal market some of the most prominent value managers have taken hits perhaps the most revered value manager is william h miller iii of the legg mason value trust the only fund to beat the s p 500 in each of the last 11 calendar years with a 285 percent decline through september it lagged behind the index by about 05 percentage points the legg mason opportunity fund a value fund also managed by mr miller was down 29 percent big recent stock purchases by mr miller have hurt him on june 30 the third largest holding in the value trust was mgic investment a mortgage insurer that fell sharply in september after issuing an earnings warning the fund also held big positions in citigroup jp morgan chase and fannie mae all down substantially this year in the opportunity fund americredit the consumer lender was the portfolio 's biggest holding at the end of june it fell more than 48 percent in september after announcing that it would issue stock to improve its liquidity mr miller declined to comment mr nygren of the oakmark fund another celebrated manager has also seen some large holdings decline sharply one was electronic data systems the computer services provider that plummeted over 65 percent in september because it said future earnings would be well below expectations mr nygren said he could not comment on eds the oakmark fund was down 118 percent for the 12 months through september some value managers remain upbeat bob olstein manager of the olstein financial alert fund down 76 percent for the 12 months through september said the negativity has gone way too far this is the most opportune time for investing i 've ever seen mr olstein 's bets on certain financial companies and semiconductor makers have not served him well this year but one large investment in an unloved industry has done better that is the arkansas best corporation a trucking company that he regards as well positioned to gain customers who once used consolidated freightways which filed for bankruptcy protection in september arkansas best has the excess capacity to easily pick up the new business mr olstein said at the end of september the stock was up 60 percent from its july low many value investors love panic sell offs believing that investors mistakenly lose faith in damaged companies many including mr miller have bought tyco international which is trying to resuscitate its reputation after its former chief executive l dennis kozlowski and chief financial officer mark h swartz were indicted on fraud charges the tyco bet could backfire badly tyco is conducting a review of its bookkeeping but said last week that it had found nothing so far that would require additional disclosure but if problems are found many value funds could suffer another serious setback
