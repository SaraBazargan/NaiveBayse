 regulators may soon open a new front in their investigation of possible wrongdoing at mutual funds focusing on the role of lawyers who represent them a senior securities and exchange commission official said yesterday an attorney who is aware of credible evidence of a material violation of the securities laws or a material breach of fiduciary duty must report this evidence up the chain of command if necessary to independent members of the fund 's board said harvey j goldschmid the sec commissioner in a speech before the investment company institute the mutual fund trade group in washington for those who do not he said the commission has available its traditional broad spectrum of remedies penalties and other sanctions mr goldschmid 's comments come as regulators continue to uncover questionable practices by fund managers his remarks are a warning for lawyers who represent funds that they have increased responsibilities as a result of sec rules that took effect in august the whole tenor of his speech is you are the law 's gatekeeper said tamar frankel a law professor at boston university you are public servants you 're not selling justice and you 're not selling income producing property that means you have to tell the client sometimes 'i know you want to do it but you know something you ca n't no one has yet asserted that specific lawyers representing particular funds knew of possibly unethical behavior by managers said paul schott stevens a partner in the washington office of dechert what is more mr stevens said no one has charged that a lawyer knew that fund managers permitted after hours trading by certain favored investors or that the managers allowed some investors to buy and sell fund shares rapidly that practice known as market timing drives up costs for other shareholders it is not clear that all forms of late trading and market timing were violations of securities laws and that lawyers who learned of such practices should have reported them said robert pietrzak a litigation partner in the new york office of sidley austin brown wood if there is evidence in an area where the law is highly unsettled the question of whether or not there is a material violation may be a very significant question the answer to which will vary from case to case mr pietrzak said because the questionable practices uncovered by the mutual fund investigations are not clearly illegal they present exactly what lawyers feared would result from the sec 's new rules said john k villa a partner at williams connolly who frequently represents large law firms lawyers action or inaction could be analyzed and criticized with the benefit of hindsight he said there 's a certain irony that the paradigm case that corporate lawyers have been so concerned about is the one that is immediately presented under the new rules mr villa said
