 her voice can be like smoke velvet or acid it sobs whispers and seduces with the raw emotional daring of edith piaf 's by turns tender and defiant her singing is so expressive that you do n't need to understand the portuguese words to comprehend the bitter experience and pain this is misia and on her third cd ritual released by erato last month this portuguese singer demonstrates why she is gaining an international following for her passionate interpretations of fado the traditional song of her country on saturday night misia comes to the society for ethical culture on the upper west side her third appearance in new york she performs with an ensemble of guitars acoustic bass and violin led by ricardo dias on piano and accordion fado from the portugese word for fate is a kind of melancholic song about loss and the force of destiny it arose in the bars and brothels of lisbon during the early 19th century the roughly 100 fado melodies can be sung to traditional lyrics or as with the blues performed with new words in lisbon fado is presented in restaurants or clubs called fado houses in stylized performances the singer man or woman dresses in black and stands unmoving as if conducting a mystic rite i do n't go onto the stage to cry my own tears misia said in a recent telephone conversation in english from her home in lisbon i do that in my kitchen with my cats and my plants i try to do something transcendent to transmit the pain of men and women of humanity after the revolution of the carnations in portugal in 1974 which led to the overthrow of the military government fado was identified with the political right and fell out of fashion over the last two decades it has regained its place in portuguese culture fado 's international reputation is largely the legacy of the singer amalia rodrigues known as the queen of fado who popularized the form until her death in 1999 while misia was acquainted with rodrigues she maintained a respectful distance from her so as not to seem to curry favor everywhere i go everybody knows what fado is thanks to amalia misia said for me she was a muse and inspiration she had that wonderful voice she inspired many new fados and she wrote beautiful lyrics herself misia credits the song lagrima tear with words by rodrigues as her inspiration to sing fado she recorded the song in 1993 and rerecorded it for her latest cd another tribute to rodrigues on the album is xaile de silencio the shawl of silence while in london for performances misia received the song 's lyrics from its writer mario cladio who sent them by fax on the day rodrigues died misia asked the guitarist carlos goncalves who accompanied rodrigues and wrote the music for tear to compose new music for the memorial song the lyrics evoke the legacy of rodrigues as well as the spirit of fado singing what a shawl of silence you left us  what a strange way of living  oh voice that burns in the shadow thorn and stem  handkerchief beckoning at each dusk born in the northern city of oporto as susana aguiar she assumed her stage name after reading a biography of misia sert the muse of parisian artists of the early 1900 's but used the portuguese accent misia 's mother is a classical spanish dancer from barcelona and her maternal grandmother was a singer in music halls misia refuses to divulge her age but judging from her own biography she appears to be around 40 it was only after moving to barcelona at the age of 20 and living there for some years that misia felt the yearnings for the music of portugal she returned to lisbon a decade ago since i come from an artistic family i feel the most safe on the stage of a theater misia said my psychiatrist said i have made the perfect choice for myself because the stage is where i can be me with all my intensity i can go from being a mythologic goddess to being bambi like astor piazzolla and ravi shankar who were opposed by musical conservatives when they made innovations in tango and indian classical music respectively misia has been criticized for straying from tradition in the beginning everyone said i am not a fadista misia said referring to the title bestowed on fado singers considered authentic but who is the khomeini of fado who can say that one musical innovation she made was to add instruments like the piano to the standard accompaniment of portuguese guitars she also incorporated accordion and violin because as a child she first learned fado tunes by listening to street musicians who played those instruments for her lyrics she made a radical departure by commissioning poems from portugal 's esteemed novelists and poets including the nobel laureate jose saramago most of the writers had never written lyrics before and were initially hesitant to enter the proscribed world of fado misia recorded the songs on her albums garras dos sentidos and paixoes diagonais and the high quality of the lyrics attracted a more literary audience even her appearance was subject to criticism in the photographs on her cd 's she looks like the young anais nin dressed in the latest designer fashions this glamorous image did not accord with how a fado singer usually appears which misia described as a nice lady in a skirt but finally they have accepted me and now the younger generation is putting on the same clothes i wear she said at first change is like a sin or sacrilege then it becomes normal and finally it becomes tradition despite her success misia continues to haunt the fado houses of lisbon which range from tourist traps to neighborhood pubs she favors clube de fado and tasca do careca bald man tavern where she meets friends for dinner and occasionally sings everywhere she goes she says people have called her the successor to rodrigues but she does not need me to be her successor because she is not dead misia said her music will always be alive misia society for ethical culture 2 west 64th street manhattan
