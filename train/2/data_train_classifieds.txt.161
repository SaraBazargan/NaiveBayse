 the justices of the illinois supreme court have decided that all the state 's judges deserve cost of living raises themselves included so they have ordered the government to pay them more but others in this deficit ridden state disagree including the governor and the comptroller who writes the checks that has set off a storm of legal maneuvers that threaten to leave the comptroller in contempt of court and some of the state 's best paid workers judges suing the governor in their own courts i would n't say that this is a constitutional crisis comptroller daniel w hynes said this afternoon but it is a constitutional clash facing a state budget crisis aides to gov rod r blagojevich say now is no time to pay judges more not when state departments are slashing budgets and when other top level employees will be going without raises so this month mr blagojevich vetoed a 28 percent cost of living increase for the more than 900 judges that would have cost 38 million judges here earn more than 127000 a year supreme court justices who earn 158000 would receive an extra 4000 a year with the increase in the worst fiscal crisis in illinois history with a 5 billion deficit you have to make tough choices a spokeswoman for mr blagojevich cheryle jackson said between investing millions for well paid judges or investing in health care for children or in preschool for at risk children the choice is clear but the justices apparently did not see it that way after two sets of terse letters were exchanged between the courts administrative offices and the comptroller 's office the justices weighed in on thursday they ordered the state to give judges raises stating that the governor 's veto might have removed the financing for them but that the action did not remove a legislative resolution from 1990 that required judges to be given annual cost of living increases the state 's constitution the justices pointed out ensures that judges salaries not be diminished in their terms in office supporters of the justices argue that the dispute is not simply a matter of cash but of a crucial legal principle that is part of the constitution that judges must not have their salaries dropped at the whim of elected officials who might then punish judges for rulings with which they disagree a spokesman for the illinois supreme court joseph tybor declined to comment this afternoon citing a flurry of pending litigation among the legal claims and counterclaims are judges suing mr blagojevich and mr hynes in cook county circuit court and mr hynes asking the supreme court to vacate its order the question legal scholars said may center on how the annual increase should be defined is it really a raise or is it something else and is the state diminishing a judge 's salary if it does not give a cost of living adjustment the question becomes whether cola is part of the salary already said dawn clark netsch who teaches law at northwestern university and is a former state comptroller it comes down to the language if the adjustment is not a raise but a legally required annual change in a judge 's salary then the state can not constitutionally take it away supporters of the justices argued if they remove it they are reducing a judge 's salary and the constitution provides that they can not do that said kevin m forde a lawyer who represents judges in the cook county suit and the purpose is not because the founding fathers were so interested in protecting judges as persons it is to protect the public so that judges may be independent david a novoselsky a lawyer who represents his father a judge in a separate legal complaint filed against mr hynes in state supreme court said the issue was not money his father benjamin is 87 they will happily donate the raise david novoselsky said adding i care about the principle the us constitution has a provision in it similar to the one in illinois 's constitution you can not reduce the salary of a judge but mr hynes said he intended to issue checks with no raises when the judges receive their monthly salaries on thursday the last day of the month the supreme court he said reached its order telling him to pay without going through the proper process of a hearing there are legitimate legal arguments on both sides mr hynes said theirs was not an enforceable order there was no lawsuit filed at that time no parties were heard one branch of government can not just mandate that another do what it says mr hynes who earns 116000 said he would not be receiving a raise this year
