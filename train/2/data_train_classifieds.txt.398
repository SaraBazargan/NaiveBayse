 the coffin lay in the city hall rotunda beneath a coffered dome that recalls the pantheon in rome it was flanked by a pair of police officers who stood as rigid as beefeaters in their dress uniforms and white gloves with their shiny leather sam browne belts creaking diagonally across their chests outside the crowd stretched down the stairs past eight metal detectors and up both sides of city hall park to chambers street it was the first time since world war i that a dignitary was honored in death by being allowed to lie in state in city hall the honor was bestowed yesterday on city councilman james e davis not so much for how he lived but how he died assassinated by a political opponent last week at a crowded council meeting inside city hall the doors of city hall were thrown open to all who wanted to pay their respects as long as they agreed to be screened for weapons thousands did from new york 's top officials to city workers to business executives to the children who took part in mr davis 's marches against violence to people from brooklyn who came to know him first as a seemingly ubiquitous candidate and then as a city councilman quite a few of the people who took time off from work and waited patiently in the july heat said they had come to know mr davis only in death some said they were outraged by the manner of his death others said they were inspired by his life story mr davis was a former police officer who started an antiviolence group and then entered politics and several of the mourners the majority of whom like mr davis were black said they came because they were tired of losing promising black role models i 'm not into politics said allison chapman 41 a secretary who met mr davis while he was campaigning in her crown heights neighborhood who used her afternoon break yesterday to say farewell but just the fact that he was a young up and coming african american trying to do right for all people it 's tragic bernice watson said that mr davis was a familiar sight in clinton hill brooklyn where he campaigned door to door he always looked straight at you as if you were the only person that was going to vote for him recalled ms watson 49 a clerical worker for the housing authority every time there was an election i would see him in the neighborhood i always felt like he was going places all told bloomberg administration officials said 7000 people paid their respects city officials say that new york 's city hall is the oldest in the nation still in operation in its nearly 200 years of existence it has been many things the scene of untold hundreds of the pointed and sometimes picayune arguments unique to local government a place for citizens to rally in times of war a welcoming station for visiting dignitaries and a speakers corner of sorts where new yorkers come to air their grievances last week though it became something else a crime scene so mayor michael r bloomberg and the city council speaker gifford miller opened it up yesterday for its first lying in state since 1918 when the honor was given to john purroy mitchel a mayor who was voted out of office and joined the air corps only to die in a training accident it 's a small token of affection that the city can show out of respect for james davis mr bloomberg said yesterday before the viewing james davis tried to make this city better and the ultimate irony is that his whole term in office was trying to work against violence and yet it was violence that claimed his life mr davis 's colleagues on the city council who watched in horror as he was killed last wednesday are a varied group and they paid their respects in varied ways charles barron of east new york brooklyn paused at his coffin and raised a clenched fist in the air john c liu of flushing queens bowed his head yvette d clarke of crown heights brooklyn left a single red rose beside mr davis 's coffin then they went outside to city hall plaza council members embraced wept shared favorite stories about mr davis and relived the frightening details of his final minutes in the city council chamber i 've spent more time in this building with the people in here than i have with my family said a visibly shaken city councilman james s oddo of staten island the council 's republican leader so if you think about the very idea of someone coming into your house shooting one of your relatives that 's how i feel first you feel shock and then that gives way to anger and anger is what i 'm feeling right now mr davis 41 was killed by othniel askew 31 a political opponent he had brought to the council meeting that day and walked past security minutes before the council meeting was set to start mr askew drew a silver colored pistol in the council chamber and shot mr davis seven times in the torso before he in turn was shot dead by a police officer the slain councilman 's mother thelma was the first inside yesterday led gently to the dark cherry wood coffin by mayor bloomberg the mayor held mrs davis 's right hand and put his other arm around her mrs davis 's left hand rested on the coffin then mr miller led in the rest of the davis family including mr davis 's younger brother geoffrey who has said he would like to run for mr davis 's seat mr bloomberg handed out tissues from a small package outside the hall annie stevenson king 66 a retired social worker from crown heights confessed that she did not much like mr davis when she first met him because of his attitude she recalled mr davis retorting that he did not much like her either and after that at every affair he would come over and hug and kiss me and say 'i 'm going to make you like me she recalled with a laugh when i saw the news on tv i just broke down she said there 's so much bad press with young black men and then to see someone who is about change get cut down like that it 's a tremendous loss we are almost conditioned to think that all our black men are doing nothing look at how much he accomplished in his life i think of what martin luther king said 'it 's not how long you live but how well you live she drew a hand to her face as her eyes welled with tears anthony herbert who was mr davis 's rival in the coming democratic primary also came to pay his respects after spending part of the morning at the board of elections a few blocks south of city hall reviewing his nominating forms for the ballot mr davis had challenged his nominating petitions timothy hayes 41 a paralegal who lives in mr davis 's district arrived at city hall at 9 am and found himself 13th in line this is the ground where it all started and this is where it all stopped he said and nadia haywood 27 who teaches mentally disabled children said she took a half day off from work even though she did not know the councilman he was just an ordinary man and he lived in brooklyn he could have been my next door neighbor she said as the extraordinary day came to an end geoffrey davis thanked all new yorkers for the support they have shown since his brother was killed right now he 's saying 'i shook up the world in his own way he said
