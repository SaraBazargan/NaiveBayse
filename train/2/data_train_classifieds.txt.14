 as the federal communications commission continues to debate whether users of wireless telephones should have to pay to receive as well as make calls the idt corporation has taken matters into its own hands based in hackensack nj idt is the communications carrier that pioneered new services including phone calls over the internet and call back a service that allows people overseas to slash the rates they pay for international calls by routing them through the united states without building a wireless network idt is now set to introduce a service that would offer nationwide wireless service while eliminating the fees cellular customers typically pay for incoming calls almost all cellular phone subscribers unlike users of traditional phones have to pay when they receive calls as the wireless industry trys to become a pervasive competitor to entrenched local telephone monopolies it is pressing the fcc to establish rules that would extend the traditional calling party pays billing model into the wireless arena that would enable wireless users who sign up for a caller pays plan to receive calls free but idt is not waiting instead it has put together a system that includes a feature that even the major carriers may not have thought of idt 's approach is to buy large lots of cellular subscriptions from big carriers like att but before selling them to consumers idt links the phones to a system of its own making that allows each phone to have two numbers one number has a standard area code and when a call comes in on that number the wireless subscriber is billed as usual for the incoming call but each idt phone also has a toll free number when someone using a normal phone calls the toll free number he hears a message that informs him that he will be charged typically 10 cents a minute to reach the wireless subscriber who would then receive the call without fees the two number system could allow a wireless subscriber to give the toll free number to most people while giving the receiver pays wireless number to close family members for instance seth schiesel
