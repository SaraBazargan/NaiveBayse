 with mortgage rates matching their lowest levels in more than 30 years thousands of americans are rushing to refinance the loans on their homes but the lift to the economy that usually comes when homeowners negotiate a better mortgage deal is unlikely to be as great this time as in the past the falling rates dropping to 654 percent on average last week for a 30 year mortgage are indeed a prop for the wavering economy with loans so cheap home sales and home construction are booming those who refinance to raise cash also strengthen an economy dependent on consumer spending and in the new rush to refinance the majority of households are doing just that but many homeowners who might have refinanced their mortgages now did so last fall when rates also fell just as low for a few weeks the pool of people who missed that window is relatively small mortgage lenders say in addition a growing number of households are using the lower rates to shrink 30 year mortgages to 15 or 20 years for about the same monthly payments the economy gets no stimulus when a homeowner does this instead of using lower rates to decrease monthly payments and increase consumer spending the economy as a result is not likely to get the same kick from this round of refinancing as it did last fall when interest rates fell in the aftermath of sept 11 then people with 7 percent mortgages rushed to refinance at 65 percent and the tendency to shorten a mortgage 's maturity rather than to refinance was not as common the people most sensitive to interest rate changes refinanced last fall said sterling edmunds jr the president of suntrust mortgage a nationwide lender headquartered in richmond va and for them to do it again the 30 year rate would have to fall another half a percentage point not since the 1960 's have rates on 30 year mortgages fallen that extra half point to 6 percent or less the increasing popularity of shorter mortgages is apparent in the 11 offices of mortgageamerica which operates in florida alabama and georgia john b johnson the chief executive attributes the trend to a growing desire among cautious americans to be debt free by their late 50 's there is an absence today of more profitable investments than homeownership itself he said and people realize this the strongest reason for refinancing is still to get lower monthly payments mr johnson said but we are seeing significant numbers of people refinancing to shorter maturities while leaving their payments unchanged more than last fall for mr edmunds 's suntrust the flow of refinancing activity while up sharply from early spring is still running 25 percent below last fall 's peak of 4 billion in new mortgages in october or as dorothy lubbes the mortgage officer at southern commercial bank in st louis said i have lots of appointments and i am extremely busy through the day but i am not putting in the extra hours that i put in last fall it has not gotten to that point yet the window of opportunity last fall stayed open only a few weeks rates reached their low point in the second week of november then bounced back to roughly 7 percent by year end and stayed there until may when the current fall began accelerating last week through each episode stock prices also plunged displaying a grim relationship falling stock prices it turns out have become a principal reason why in this business cycle long term interest rates including mortgage rates are also falling in this respect the two have become wrapped in a strange embrace that has made the flight from stocks an unexpected source of strength for consumer spending mainly through mortgage refinancing in a recovery stock prices and interest rates usually rise together but this time they are falling together it suggests that if you get a rally in stocks you will get a setback in mortgage rates said henry kaufman the wall street economist and consultant we are caught in a recovery that helps people and hurts them at the same time fear seems to make this unusual mechanism work displaying more fear of stocks than at any time since the 1980 's investors are shifting their money to what they consider safe investments mainly 10 year treasury notes and mortgage backed bonds treasuries are guaranteed by the federal government and mortgage backed bonds have homes as collateral as the demand rises for both these types of bonds their rates fall and so do the associated rates for household mortgages the stock market is not alone of course in pulling down long term rates a weak economy has convinced many investors that the recovery from last year 's recession will take longer than originally anticipated and the federal reserve will not even consider raising rates until late this year at the earliest as recently as may forecasters had expected the fed to have raised rates by now to control inflation but in the weak economy inflation has been dormant a bit of gloom and doom has developed about where the economy is going and that weighs on rates said lyle e gramley a senior economic adviser to schwab capital markets clearly it weighs on the 30 year mortgage rate which edged down to 654 percent last week from 657 percent the week before according to freddie mac the government sponsored mortgage agency the 654 percent matched last november 's low of 645 percent after including the additional points charged in the fall as a refinancing fee freddie mac bases its average rate on a weekly survey of mortgage lenders its average rate last week also matched another post 1960 's low in early october of 1998 when a surge in refinancing helped to lift the economy during a growing global financial crisis stock prices fell then too as investors shifted their money to what they considered safer investments now in the latest round of mortgage refinancing many homeowners are reducing their payments by significant amounts some customers at southern commercial for example have cut up to 80 from each monthly installment on an 80000 mortgage the second most popular option has been to keep the monthly payments unchanged but borrow more thus tapping the rising value of homes when prices are rising so quickly that some experts say a bubble has developed alan greenspan the chairman of the federal reserve rejects that concern in congressional testimony he has argued that the housing market does not lend itself easily to bubbles because home prices vary by region and homeowners do not buy and sell quickly as stockholders do fed policy makers argue that even before the latest refinancing boom homeowners who sold diverted some of their windfall profits to consumer spending and that dynamic continues to provide crucial support for the recovery the fed is supporting every dimension of the housing market said albert m wojnilower a wall street economist in principle if stock prices keep dropping there is no reason why the rate on 30 year mortgages should not go below 6 percent
