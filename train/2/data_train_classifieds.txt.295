 the house at 19 gramercy park south with its strikingly elegant 1880 's interiors was called by the late critic brendan gill the greatest private house remaining in private hands in new york the house was recently put on the market as a stanford white house in part because mr gill had attributed part of it to the famed architect and the asking price is 18 million but what scant documentary evidence there is while certainly not conclusive suggests that the house was not by white but by another architect who shared white 's offices raising the question of just how much a stanford white attribution is worth especially to an already grand building gramercy park was opened in the 1840 's as an expensive residential enclave where the householders were given keys to the central garden kept locked to outsiders in 1845 william samuel johnson a whig politician built a simple brick house numbered 19 on the southeast corner of irving place and gramercy park south johnson lived in the house until 1850 when he sold it to a paper merchant horace brooks brooks built a stable on the lot to the south now demolished and in 1866 added a mansard fifth story to the house by the 1880 's census records show a variety of families at that address as if the house had been informally converted to apartments it was purchased in 1887 by the financier stuyvesant fish son of hamilton fish a former new york governor in may 1887 stuyvesant fish at age 36 became president of the illinois central railroad and in june his architect filed plans to alter what by that time was an old house the alterations were mostly interior delivering to mr fish and his wife marian nicknamed mame an attractive series of rooms some of which have survived later remodeling the low ceilinged first floor has a wide reception area of painted paneling with two rooms to the left at the corner is an exquisite intimate corner study with sophisticated oak paneling a fine fireplace and a carved chimney breast and also a half paneled dining room with sliding doors up a sensuously modeled staircase the second floor has a white painted central room with columns and unusual classical detailing early and elaborate for 1887 when american architecture was still in the thrall of the richardsonian romanesque in 1979 mr gill wrote in the new yorker that the fish house was designed by white reflecting a strong oral tradition that the famed partner in mckim mead white was in charge white 's house no longer standing was just across gramercy park at lexington avenue the fishes later house at 78th street and madison avenue was definitely designed by white and mckim mead white did render a bill to the fishes for work on the gramercy park south house but the internal records were marked check to stratton most of the firm 's surviving records are at the new york historical society indeed both the alteration permit at the department of buildings and the real estate record guide a trade journal list the architect as sidney v stratton not mckim mead white stratton is now a little known designer but he was one of the first american students at the ecole des beaux arts in paris along with h h richardson and richard morris hunt after the ecole stratton worked for hunt and went out on his own in the 1870 's he designed the queen anne style house school of industry at 120 west 16th street several country houses and the green alcove a gemlike portion of an older room now at the new york society library at 53 east 79th street mosette broderick a lecturer in the urban design program at nyu who has studied the work of both stratton and mckim mead white extensively says that stratton met charles mckim at the ecole sublet space from the firm in 1877 and developed an unusual arrangement from the early 1880 's to about 1889 stratton was listed on the firm 's letterhead but underneath the partners names and separated from them by a line mrs broderick says that in the early 1880 's stratton was much better connected to new york society than were charles mckim william mead or white that they used stratton to gain access to that world but he pursued and designed commissions independently she says that there may have been some interplay between the architects but that there no reason to consider this commission as by anyone but stratton further evidence bolsters that thesis stuyvesant fish 's brother nicholas altered a house at 53 irving place also in 1887 there was a mckim mead white bill for this work too but for the brother 's house the alteration permit was taken out in the name of mckim mead white not in the name of stratton mrs broderick 's view is not shared by the architect samuel g white author of the houses of mckim mead white rizzoli 1998 the office was so small everyone was working together says mr white a great grandson of stanford white and a partner at buttrick white burtis mr white thinks there is a high likelihood of design collaboration and stratton 's presence makes this more interesting than the run of the mill house by the firm he says the fishes remained at 19 gramercy park south until 1898 when they asked white to build an entirely new house at 78th and madison in 1909 a six story apartment building was added on the south end of the gramercy park lot and the complex was operated as a multiple dwelling cecilia beaux a prominent portrait painter lived there in the 1910 's and norman thomas was living there in 1944 when he ran on the socialist party ticket for president by that time the publicist benjamin sonnenberg was a resident and within a few years he bought the entire structure mr sonnenberg combined the old fish house and the apartment building to make a single vast private house of 35 rooms and added some magnificent interiors of his own like the second floor drawing room facing gramercy park with 17th century english paneling when the sonnenberg family put the house up for sale in 1979 the white attribution was used it had stuck the current owners the fashion designer richard tyler and his wife lisa trafficante bought it in 1995 for 35 million according to their broker leslie mason of douglas elliman ms mason has incorporated much of mr gill 's eloquent description of the house into sales literature including his white attribution ms mason says she does n't think the questioning of the attribution to white will harm the sale of such a building other brokers agree john foreman a vice president at the halstead property company said that if there 's a sophisticated buyer an attribution to white may incline them toward buying but that does n't mean the value of the house is increased and leslie j garfield head of the brokerage firm that bears his name said i do n't think the attribution adds anything at that price level people do n't care who the architect is they 're buying a house on gramercy park
