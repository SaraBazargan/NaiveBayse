 while neither democrat denise majette nor republican representative john linder is a household name they both scored impressive victories over better known rivals in the georgia primary on tuesday ms majette a yale educated former judge handily defeated a five term democratic incumbent cynthia a mckinney a vocal liberal in the democratic primary in the state 's fourth congressional district mr linder cruised to an easy victory in the republican primary in the seventh congressional district over representative bob barr a strident conservative who four years ago had led the effort to impeach president bill clinton i may only be 5 foot 1 but tonight i am 10 feet tall ms majette 46 told cheering supporters at her victory celebration as she stood on a platform in order to be seen over the lectern by winning their respective primaries mr linder and ms majette are virtually assured of victories in the general election since their parties dominate both of their districts we 're just here this evening to congratulate john linder for having run a very good race mr barr said in conceding defeat we go into the fall race very much a united party mr linder 59 a former dentist and business executive whose phlegmatic style was a sharp contrast to mr barr 's sizzle had at times made his steady demeanor an issue in the campaign during one debate for example mr linder said to his opponent i will remind you that i am the one who has been married for 39 years to the same woman a subtle criticism of mr barr 53 who is in his third marriage the race between mr linder and mr barr two incumbents running in a district reconfigured by redistricting and the contest between ms majette and ms mckinney were the two highlights of the georgia primary in other important races representative saxby chambliss whose campaign received strong backing from the white house defeated two opponents in the republican primary for the senate and will face freshman democratic senator max cleland in november mr cleland ran unopposed in the democratic primary in the gubernatorial race former state senator sonny perdue defeated two opponents for the right to take on governor roy barnes a democrat with 89 percent of the vote counted in the seventh district mr linder had 67 percent to 33 percent for mr barr in the fourth district with 75 percent of the vote counted ms majette had 60 percent of the vote to ms mckinney 's 40 percent reports indicated a strong turnout of republican voters casting ballots in the democratic primary presumably in a bid to defeat ms mckinney 47 state officials were investigating the source of telephone calls made to voters in heavily republican areas telling them it is a violation of state and federal law to attempt to vote in a democratic primary without proper documentation republican leaders charged that the phone calls originated with the mckinney campaign as an attempt to tamp down republican crossover voting in the open primary a spokesman for ms mckinney denied the accusation both of the congressional races were noteworthy as intraparty spats in carefully drawn districts dominated by one party virtually assuring the winners of being elected to congress as a result neither race will have an impact on the narrow balance between the two parties in the house still both races featured well known personalities many from out of state and both races produced their share of vitriol ms mckinney who has served 10 years in the house has been criticized for a number of tart comments such as declaring that the bush administration may have ignored warnings of the sept 11 attacks and that president bush 's allies in multinational corporations have profited from the war on terrorism she also said she would have accepted a 10 million check from a saudi prince for victims of the attacks that mayor rudolph w giuliani of new york spurned after the prince suggested that america 's policies in the middle east were partly to blame for the hijackings the mckinney majette race also rekindled concerns about a split between blacks and jews a rift that many leaders of both communities hoped had healed in recent years but ms mckinney who has been vocal in support of arab causes drew much of her campaign financing from pro arab groups while jewish groups contributed to ms majette 's campaign a number of prominent blacks including the rev jesse jackson and louis farrakhan of the nation of islam who have been accused of making anti semitic remarks campaigned for ms mckinney on the republican side mr linder and mr barr who has served four terms ran against each other in a district that cuts across atlanta 's northern suburbs the revamped district was part of a new congressional map created by georgia 's overwhelmingly democratic legislature that shifted much of mr barr 's old seventh district into a new one that favored a democratic candidate both incumbents are conservatives and differ little on fiscal and social issues like cutting taxes gun control and abortion with little to distinguish themselves on issues or ideology the race featured more of an emphasis on style a former united states attorney mr barr burst on the national scene in 1997 when he became the first republican to call for the impeachment of mr clinton mr barr soon became a regular on talk shows and the next year was a house manager making the case in the senate for mr clinton 's removal as befits mr barr 's celebrity status he attracted a host of conservative luminaries including charlton heston g gordon liddy and oliver l north to campaign for him in another primary on tuesday in wyoming businessman eli bebout won the republican primary to succeed gov jim geringer who could not seek re election because of term limits mr bebout will face democrat dave freudenthal a former federal prosecutor in the general election in the fall
