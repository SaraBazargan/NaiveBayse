 technology developers are being forced to rethink products from photocopiers to software to meet some new requirements from one of their biggest customers the federal government that is because the government is facing some new requirements itself under regulations taking effect today all technology purchased by federal agencies must be accessible to the disabled with few exceptions the provisions will affect a wide range of equipment and services from federal web sites used by the public to office equipment used by government employees while the regulations issued under section 508 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 exempt some sectors like sensitive parts of the military they otherwise extend broadly to agencies as diverse as the social security administration the coast guard and the tennessee valley authority some of the changes that will gradually become apparent are government webcasts captioned for the deaf and photocopiers accessible to employees in wheelchairs the postal service which operates 37000 stamp machines will now buy only vending machines accessible to the blind as today 's deadline approached however many of the policy 's implications and details remained unclear it 's a frenzy right now said amy berger the section 508 coordinator for the united states geological survey who is blind and uses software that reads web pages aloud there 's so much going on people are trying to figure how it 's all going to unfold only six months have passed since the requirements for accessibility were issued and the government is still trying to get the word out to federal employees and technology companies through seminars and an inundation of memorandums some standards have purposely been made general describing goals rather than how to achieve them to allow for the ever changing uses and specifications of technology as a result interpretations may vary among agencies and even within them also items may be exempted if they require a fundamental alteration or there is an undue burden terms that are subject to interpretation don heffernan the acting chief information officer of federal supply service at the general services administration the government 's main purchasing arm acknowledged that confusion had resulted these are not a clean set of guidelines he said trying to educate them all when you 're not quite sure yourself is not an easy task one misinterpretation arose in april when an e mail message was sent by a midlevel employee to the agency 's webmasters warning any web sites that are not section 508 compliant will go dark john sindelar deputy associate administrator of the office of governmentwide policy at the general services administration said that existing web sites were actually not subject to the regulations taking effect today but that the sites were being updated as part of a federal policy of accommodating the disabled with agencies using the section 508 standards as guidelines we were giving them the incentive to get hustling and get them done he said under the new standards web pages will be fully readable by the software that translates words into sounds for the blind meaning all images must have text equivalents at present web pages without such text tags can present hurdles for people like ms berger who tried to use the web to sign up for a training course about section 508 i went out to register she said and there was an instruction to click on the blue triangle it was a joke also under the new standards wheelchair users like craig luigart the chief information officer at the department of education will find it easier to use equipment like photocopiers it can be a pain said mr luigart who has a rare neuromuscular disorder called primary lateral sclerosis when the control deck is horizontal to the floor and above my eye level it means i have to wrestle myself out of the wheelchair to look at the controls apart from section 508 's effects on web sites and federal employees the regulations will affect the technology industry significantly though the regulations cover only purchasing by federal agencies the buying clout of the federal government more than 45 billion on information technology alone annually is pushing the industry to rethink and redesign a range of products hewlett packard for example is incorporating the accessibility standards into its product lines in large part because it does not want to develop separate lines and sees the demand for accessible products expanding to state governments and schools companies like ibm canon and adobe systems are taking similar steps but although most large corporations are aware of section 508 many small and medium size companies are being caught off guard francesca brown the federal contract market analyst for the boston information group said she found out about section 508 at a government exposition last month i was shocked said ms brown whose company is planning to sell software to government agencies i see this deadline as impractical and untenable while it certainly is a worthy act i think it 's also unrealistic section 508 was added in 1986 to the rehabilitation act of 1973 setting goals for accommodation of the disabled in federal purchasing in 1998 congress enacted legislation toughening the requirements and enforcement provisions individuals can bring legal complaints against agencies for failure to comply though they can not seek punitive damages some of the regulations are very specific for example on web pages images that blink or flicker are forbidden to flash 2 to 55 times a second to protect people with photosensitive epilepsy from having seizures triggered by the visual stimulus but other guidelines are more general for example the regulations say that if a piece of equipment requires biometric forms of user identification like a fingerprint or a retina scan there must also be an alternative process so that people without the use of their hands or eyes may use them some predict that accessibility in technology will become standard much as closed captioning is routinely included on television what we are entering here is a transition period said mr sindelar of the general services administration in five years what we are seeing as issues now will no longer be issues
