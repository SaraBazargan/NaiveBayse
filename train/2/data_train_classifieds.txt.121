 the pell mell advances of rebel forces in afghanistan have so outpaced expectations that american commanders are considering a new war plan that would scale back bombing raids and intensify counterguerrilla operations senior officials said today the new plan would include a greater concentration on gathering intelligence and hunting leaders of the taliban and al qaeda in diminishing pockets of resistance the officials said it could also make use of coalition troops either americans or others to secure key points wrested from the taliban the officials said though the pentagon 's preference is have those tasks done by local anti taliban forces the commander of american forces in afghanistan gen tommy r franks is expected to arrive in washington on thursday to brief secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld on the details the immediate effect of the evolution of the pentagon 's campaign could well be an easing of american strikes in afghanistan that coincides with the beginning of the muslim holy month of ramadan which it to begin friday night you 're going to see a lot more flying but a lot less dropping of bombs and missiles a senior officer said another senior pentagon official said there would be no declaration of the reduction in the air campaign and certainly no formal suspension of the attacks as some leaders in the region had sought in view of the imminence of ramadan american warplanes will still hunt for targets with the goal of denying the taliban and al qaeda any opportunity to regroup after their retreat from cities they held earlier this week but the gunners would pull their triggers more selectively success has a way of reducing your target set one officer said the proposal includes several new elements and is a significant reshaping of the campaign general franks who has led the troops from his headquarters at macdill air force base in tampa is also drafting plans to deploy allied forces including americans to conduct a broader spectrum of operations from striking at the taliban and al qaeda in mountain redoubts to securing routes for food and medical convoys to seizing airfields pentagon officials said they were receiving more detailed intelligence on the movements of mullah muhammad omar the taliban 's leader as the swath of territory in which he can safely operate has shrunk they added that several strikes had been ordered in recent days on buildings and vehicles thought to contain taliban leaders or members of al qaeda an attack was ordered on kabul tuesday after the united states received compelling evidence of al qaeda personnel inside a defense department official said today officials presume that all those inside were killed but the official dismissed reports that osama bin laden had been spotted during the recent days of confusion as commander of the united states central command overseeing forces from the indian ocean to the red sea general franks is contemplating the formation of special task forces to deal with missions like aid counterterrorism and reconnaissance officials said central command planners are also deciding how to assign troops from other countries working through a military office in qatar even as the rebels advance and the taliban appear to have collapsed the pentagon continues to build up its forces and senior officials continue to assert that their mission is far from over a senior officer said today that secretary rumsfeld had ordered three more ac 130 special forces gunships which bring a withering rapid fire high caliber attack to ground forces for a total of nine almost half the air force 's fleet general franks is also reviewing growing offers of troops from other nations pentagon officials said he is working on new arrangements for providing relief on a grand scale including the use of nato airlifts and the need to put troops at airports to protect the planes as supplies are flown in officials said turkey is willing to play a role similar to australia 's in east timor leading an international force to secure kabul but has not been asked yet the pentagon 's first choice for securing relief routes is the northern alliance itself the second choice is coalition members especially from islamic states american troops are a final option the officials said finally general franks is reviewing plans for concentrating his forces in the air and on the ground in the narrowing sections of the country where the conflict is still hot and where mr bin laden and the top taliban leaders are thought to be hiding this has moved so fast we have to step back and review where we go next one defense department official said another senior pentagon official said given the developments it 's time to take stock the narrowing of taliban operations presents opportunities and difficulties the united states can now focus both its surveillance and its direct action on smaller portions of afghanistan at the same time the job of identifying taliban and al qaeda targets as separate from northern alliance troops soldiers loyal to a southern pashtun tribes and even afghan civilians has become increasingly difficult given the turmoil in the region in the south dispersing taliban fighters are moving in small units and are mixed up with emerging resistance forces once again fighter jets operating from two american carriers in the arabian sea were reported to be returning with most of their bombs still fixed beneath their wings pentagon officials also said that as the taliban 's fortunes appear to wane rapidly offers of rewards for information might be more likely to be accepted officially the pentagon cautioned against an early declaration of success saying it could be days before it is clear whether the taliban and al qaeda are on the run or simply in tactical retreat to more defensible positions at a pentagon briefing today rear adm john stufflebeem deputy director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff said the united states is prepared if conditions dictate to shift to a counterguerrilla strategy in this he suggested the anti taliban forces might well take part we should also presume that northern alliance opposition groups or for that matter all opposition groups are familiar with this kind of guerrilla warfare he said especially since it happens in a country that they are experienced in
