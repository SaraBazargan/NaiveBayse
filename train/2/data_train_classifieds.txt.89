 so has ebay put itself up for the ultimate auction probably not financiers close to ebay said yesterday the morning after cnbc carried a report that the company was in talks that could lead to an acquisition of the auction site by yahoo the big web portal but they said ebay was still trying to figure out a deal that would let it tap into yahoo 's huge audience of internet users as it had already done with america online and disney 's go network an outright sale is far less likely because ebay 's 26 billion market value makes it an expensive prize even a limited deal that would put ebay auctions on yahoo 's site would be complex as yahoo now has the no 2 auction service and while analysts said rumors about a possible merger had sent both stocks higher in recent days investors yesterday appeared to conclude that a deal was unlikely analysts said ebay 's stock closed at 18952 off 2148 from tuesday 's close while yahoo fell to 15850 a decline of 1025 then again on the internet anything is possible and certainly there have been any number of cases where companies that began to talk about small deals wound up at the altar and few analysts would have predicted that america online and time warner would be able to come to merger terms given the disparities of their stock market valuations what 's more analysts and financiers say a combination of yahoo and ebay two of the few profitable internet companies is in fact more sensible than many possible deals bandied about since the america online time warner pact yahoo despite a 35 percent drop in stock price since the start of the year still has a market value of 96 billion big enough to buy almost any company willing to take its stock but yahoo has steadfastly insisted that its best opportunity is to be a switzerland of the web linking to information from a wide range of sources devoting more resources to creating its own information or entertainment or even buying a media company it argues is simply a burden that will drag down its high margins and it is counting on its brand to continue to drive traffic rather than owning or being owned by a telecommunications company many wonder whether yahoo will be able to maintain this strategy as the focus of the internet shifts from pages of text to audio and video delivered over high speed connections aol is betting that it is better to own both the content from time warner 's television movie and music properties and the distribution from the company 's cable systems yahoo by contrast has maintained its model buying broadcast com which maintains links to a wide range of audio and video content by others and it just started financevision a daily internet video feed on business and stock market news it does have live anchors but they act as a human search engine providing introductions and links to video feeds provided by others the one place where yahoo 's strategy has shifted over the years is that it increasingly wants to earn fees from linking buyers and sellers together both in its shopping channel and in its auction service this approach to electronic commerce can have much higher margins than the messy and expensive business of running warehouses and holding inventory that amazoncom is in and no one has proved the potential of such an electronic marketplace as well as ebay which has transformed an electronic flea market of classified advertising into a huge rapidly growing and profitable community of buyers and sellers ebay 's growth has continued even in the face of competition from amazon the web 's biggest store and yahoo which lets sellers list items free ebay and amazon charge listing fees and take a percentage of each completed sale so ebay analysts say is perhaps the best single acquisition target for yahoo it would make it the undisputed leader in person to person commerce while keeping the company focused on the internet i do n't think a traditional media company would dovetail with yahoo 's vision but ebay would give them a great way to monetize their large user base said paul noglows an analyst with chase h q of course the biggest stumbling block for yahoo is the price henry blodget merrill lynch 's internet analyst suggested that yahoo could pay up to 300 a share for ebay or 40 billion without suffering any significant dilution in its earnings but others question whether yahoo which has a reputation for being extraordinarily cheap would be willing to give up what would be 30 percent of the equity in the combined company to get ebay for ebay by contrast the issue is whether the company needs to link with a broader service the strategic question for ebay is what comes after auctions said jim breyer a partner at venture firm accel partners to justify their valuation they have to get bold about their strategy and move beyond that others argue that ebay has plenty of growth left in recent weeks it expanded its auction model to other markets including used cars and business equipment if ebay stays independent it can become a much bigger company than it is today said jamie kiggen a donaldson lufkin jenrette analyst the bear case on ebay rested primarily on the idea their opportunity was not very large just in the last two weeks they have shown they can identify new markets still ebay is constantly looking for ways to expand its audience and head off potential competitors as much as a year ago even as yahoo was readying its own auction site ebay executives were holding exploratory conversations with the company about how to capitalize on yahoo 's extensive distribution network then the dialogue centered mostly on a strategic partnership although the two companies flirted with the idea of a potential merger those talks faltered though and yahoo and ebay soon found themselves competitors in the online auction market after that ebay negotiated and subsequently expanded an arrangement with america online to operate auctions on all of aol 's various services and this year disney 's go network abandoned its own auction plans and decided to offer links to ebay instead ebay obviously would love to gain access to yahoo 's audience as well the second largest on the internet after america online but analysts say such a deal would be more complex than the ebay arrangements with aol and disney as it would have to find a way to account for yahoo 's existing auction service perhaps analysts said ebay could buy yahoo auctions for some combination of cash or ebay shares ebay and yahoo officials declined to discuss any potential business arrangements sara farley an e commerce analyst at painewebber said it might be smartest for ebay to partner with as many companies as possible and not limit itself to an alliance with a single company in this market they do n't know who the next newcomer will be she said they do n't want to limit their options
