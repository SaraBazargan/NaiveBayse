 calling a state financed radio advertisement that promoted the economy of upstate new york an obvious plug for representative rick a lazio her opponent in the senate race hillary rodham clinton contended today that mr lazio had violated an agreement to restrict spending on commercials it was the second time the two candidates squabbled over the interpretation of their pact to ban the use of soft money largely unrestricted unlimited contributions to political parties that buy air time for commercials today 's dispute came in the final weeks of the campaign and erupted over a murkier issue than the first one indicating that the candidates are intensely scrutinizing each other 's spending practices on the lookout for anything that could break the deal and perhaps allow more spending in the first incident mr lazio who has made banning the use of soft money a theme of his campaign agreed earlier this month to return about 14 million he had received from the republican national committee and spent on commercials but this time mr lazio called mrs clinton 's accusation laughable and his campaign immediately fired off a vitriolic response saying in a news release we thank mrs clinton for the chuckle the radio commercials at issue which were broadcast for four days this week on radio stations from westchester to albany and in binghamton featured a voice over by gov george e pataki a close republican ally of mr lazio 's the ads cost 14000 which was paid by the empire state development corporation a state agency the two candidates have disagreed sharply over how upstate new york 's economy is faring and the message in the commercial which touted ibm 's recent announcement that it would invest in a 25 billion chip manufacturing plant in dutchess county echoed mr lazio 's view that the region 's economy was rebounding in the commercial governor pataki said new york state 's economy is strong and our future has never looked brighter during a campaign stop on long island today mrs clinton cited an article published in the buffalo news that said the commercial was broadcast just before lazio commercials on several albany radio stations on friday the commercial she said was clearly intended to help mr lazio 's campaign i am appalled that the state would be doing this and spending state taxpayer dollars on it she said and i call on mr lazio to end it immediately she called the ads the second breach of our agreement and to use a baseball metaphor it 's a second strike although the pact apparently does not apply to ads by state agencies but mr lazio while on an eight stop campaign swing from manhattan to buffalo today said the commercial had no connection to his campaign and was a routine and effective tool to promote tourism economic development and job creation here in new york i am flabbergasted that she would reach so far he said speaking to reporters between campaign stops in binghamton the fact is these commercials have been running based on the 'i love new york theme i do n't know if mrs clinton has ever heard of that that slogan a spokesman for mr pataki called mrs clinton 's insistence that the commercial was aimed at helping mr lazio 's campaign a desperate desperate charge from someone who has no facts to back it up the spokesman michael mckeon said the timing of the commercial had no relationship to the election but was pegged to ibm 's announcement of its plans to build a plant in east fishkill the commercials began running tuesday a week after ibm 's announcement mr mckeon said the empire state development corporation regularly ran promotional ads when there was good news about the economy mrs clinton 's campaign manager bill de blasio sent a letter today to mr lazio 's campaign manager bill dal col asserting that if mr lazio wants to run feel good commercials justifying why he does n't have an economic plan for upstate he should do so with hard money and not rely on these state run issue ads the lazio campaign then issued a largely sarcastic news release likening mrs clinton 's accusation to saying that president clinton 's weekly radio addresses because they reflect viewpoints mrs clinton has also expressed during her campaign on topics like education and the middle east were also a breach of the soft money agreement the tongue in cheek news release continued the lazio campaign also revealed that an ad for oscar mayer bologna aired in the syracuse media market last week was aimed at subliminally boosting mrs clinton 's nonsensical economic plan the dispute spiced up a day of campaigning that while so close to the nov 7 election was otherwise sure to be overshadowed by the opening game of the world series mrs clinton who whispered me too to a young yankees fan at a bookstore in port washington was stumping through lazio turf he is from long island and on pretty solid met fans territory as mrs clinton was touring the dolphin bookstore on port washington boulevard robin ryan a co owner of the store offered the first lady a baseball cap that said port washington and suggested that she wear it mrs clinton smiled broadly but did not take the cap she did pick out two books barbara kingsolver 's prodigal summer and the pocket size blue day book a lesson in cheering yourself up mrs clinton suggested that she would give the little blue book to her mother she also signed several books for customers including little women which she said was one of her favorite books mr lazio a met fan posed for a picture at a baseball stadium in binghamton that is home to a mets minor league team his other stops today included a center for the elderly in binghamton where he promised to support prescription drug benefits for the elderly poor and spoke nostalgically about his grandmother rose who immigrated from italy when she was 11 he lately has taken to emphasizing his italian roots in a bid to appear more attractive to that sizable voting bloc at the binghamton center mr lazio encountered a dozen protesters who carried signs imploring him to pay more attention to the economy one demonstrator wore a pink ostrich costume and bent over repeatedly as if trying to stick his head in the ground a play on a clinton ad about the economy that mocks mr lazio by showing an ostrich sticking its head in the sand
