 it was a year ago that edward f stancik the special new york city schools investigator issued the finding that dozens of teachers and 2 principals in 32 schools had helped students cheat on standardized reading and math tests used to rank schools and promote students mr stancik said the methods from teachers using palm cards to overzealous test coaching were so varied and widespread that they could only be the tip of the iceberg but a year later a former school inspector hired by the teachers union has reinvestigated the allegations and accused mr stancik of padding evidence of cheating to make wrongdoing look far more pervasive than it was and of shoddy and unfair investigative methods the investigator thomas d thacher 2nd a former inspector general of the school construction authority found that of the 9 teachers dismissed outright 3 have been offered reinstatement and that 15 others who were the subject of disciplinary hearings were back in the classroom mr stancik 's post was set up 10 years ago to investigate recurring corruption in city schools but successive chancellors have accused him of exaggerating problems in a quest for media attention his supporters say he is a much needed outside check on a huge school system that has been inept and sluggish in investigating itself mr thacher said that mr stancik 's investigators ignored evidence that pointed toward the innocence of at least 35 out of more than 50 educators accused of cheating routinely declined to interview teachers when they asked for a union representative or lawyer to be present and ignored some eyewitnesses in classrooms where cheating was alleged to have taken place one 11 year old girl a student at ps 99 in queens was interviewed when she was home only with her 14 year old brother mr thacher said the boy let the two men in because they showed badges and he lacked the confidence to say no according to mr thacher the cheating report mr thacher said was so flawed that it lacked credibility amounting to nothing more than a terrible miscarriage of justice randi weingarten the union 's president at a news conference with mr thacher called on the board of education to review the charges against all the teachers the union said it hired mr thacher now president of his own private investigation firm because of his reputation as a thorough and scrupulous investigator mr stancik stood by his report yesterday saying that he would not be intimidated and that mr thacher 's report represents nothing more than the union 's desire to protect dishonest educators in an interview mr stancik said that in hundreds of interviews conducted during the cheating investigation his office might have made some mistakes but that it 's like during the jfk assassination listing 100 interesting things and saying 'see it was a conspiracy in one case study mr thacher said a teacher rebecca ballantine had been wrongfully accused of cheating because of a sudden spike in the test scores of her students in his december 1999 report mr stancik accused ms ballantine a seventh grade teacher at intermediate school 450 in the east village of major transgressions including directing children to check their answers during the test or pick another answer interviews with students mr thacher said made it clear that what mr stancik had construed as cheating had actually occurred during practice examinations he said mr stancik had failed to interview a proctor during the exam who later said ms ballantine was innocent miss ballantine her eyes glistening apparently with tears attended the news conference yesterday and described the experience of being accused of cheating as devastating she added it changed my life in very huge ways it was hard for everyone i know family friends also colleagues at my school as an untenured teacher she was dismissed the day after mr stancik released his findings she was later offered reinstatement she said mr stancik stood by his findings in ms ballantine 's case yesterday saying that his investigators had originally suspected all of is 450 because of high numbers of erasures on test sheets but had been able to substantiate cheating only in her class and in the class of a colleague mayor rudolph w giuliani ridiculed the thacher report yesterday saying that the uft hired someone to reach the result they wanted to reach and i think it really is a shame both ms weingarten and mr thacher took pains yesterday to say they were not denying that cheating had occurred in some cases but mr thacher said that mr stancik had aggregated data over four years and many test administrations and he noted that the accused educators amounted to 05 percent of the 102000 educators in the city system long after it had completed its investigation mr thacher said mr stancik 's office sent a series of thank you notes to the parents of several children who had been questioned the notes warned that the teacher 's union has hired private investigators who may try to ask your child about the answers given to our investigators they went on to advise the parents that they did not have to allow their children to be interviewed but if they did you have the right to be present after getting such a thank you note the mother of the 11 year old girl who was interviewed while her parents were at work wrote a letter of complaint to mr stancik accusing his investigators of using gestapto like tactics mr stancik said yesterday that the investigators believed the 14 year old boy to be 18 and legally an adult
