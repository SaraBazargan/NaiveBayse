 when richard a grasso the chairman of the new york stock exchange said last year that the big board was considering a backup trading floor at a nuclear distance from new york city it was treated as an ill phrased gaffe but after last week 's power failure that blanketed an area stretching from the northeast to the midwest companies are taking a harder look at whether their disaster recovery plans go far enough literally the geographic dispersion of this event really causes some rethinking for companies said jim simmons the chief executive of sungard availability services a company in wayne pa that runs disaster recovery centers for about 10000 clients in north america and europe many companies that tried to manage their own disaster recovery plans he said found on aug 14 that the backup site they had created was still within the blackout area he said customers told him gee i never thought it would be out on long island and out in new jersey but even having backup centers hundreds of miles away might not have helped he said since the blackout zone extended into the midwest and canada the education coming out of this disaster is you ca n't predict a disaster he said companies like his ensure that the data is there and desks are there for clients who pay anything from a few hundred dollars a month to a million dollars a month for some companies he said minutes of downtime can cost millions of dollars so many companies look to services from companies like sungard and ibm to handle that side of the business for them they can create disaster hardened backup offices even if they happen to fall within the blackout zone ready to go on short notice and linked directly to their computer networks in ways that ensure against any loss of important information and little if any interruption of business transactions having operations distributed across the nation is an old and honored strategy for companies with big call centers said gary morgenstern a spokesman for att when a call center in new york goes down he said that traffic is automatically routed to the west coast and the flow of commerce continues but for many companies setting up redundant operations in far flung places can be expensive said don demarco vice president for business continuity and recovery services at ibm and the probabilities are fairly low that a true test of such preparations will ever come i can only think of one or two clients in the past couple of months he said who have told us they want substantial geographical separation between their operations centers every single company should decide what their tolerance for risk is he said the thriftier strategy makes sense until a big problem like the blackout occurs if they need it it 's sure nice to know it 's there he said more and more the choice is not theirs to make government regulations of financial industries for example increasingly require substantial efforts aimed at ensuring stability in an emergency and in many cases customers are demanding to see proof that a business is ready for trouble before they will award it a major contract or place a company within its supply chain of manufacturing he said today he said risk involves the whole ecosystem of commerce still despite last week 's big scare new customers have not started banging down the doors said john shields executive vice president of telehouse a data center and disaster recovery company in new york that works largely with the financial services industries employees of sumitomo bank a client walked from their midtown manhattan offices to the telehouse offices near wall street and found a building with the lights still on and the air conditioning still working but it will take time for many companies to evaluate their disaster planning before deciding whether they want to follow in sumitomo 's footsteps the fallout takes a little while to get organized he said current customers of so called business continuity and disaster recovery firms however are already talking about increasing the scope of their contracts said richard fleischman founder of a disaster recovery firm in new york that bears his name i 'd say 75 percent of them he said have requested additional facilities and additional service that is not surprising but it is not always the case mr demarco of ibm said that some customers learn from experience but seem to learn the wrong lesson he described a corporate client that survived a major flood with the help of his company 's disaster recovery services and then declined to renew its contract for the next year mr demarco said he was aghast are you kidding he recalled asking we just saved your company the client however was unmoved we 're in a hundred year flood zone mr demarco recalled him saying and it just happened
