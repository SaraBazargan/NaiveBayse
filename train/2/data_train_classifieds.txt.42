 a federal judge has ordered that the simon property group be stripped of its control of the mall of america in minnesota saying that the company the nation 's largest retail real estate investment trust breached its fiduciary duty to its canadian partner by secretly arranging to gain an ownership interest in the mall in his ruling issued late wednesday judge paul a magnuson of united states district court in minneapolis ordered simon to sell a 275 percent stake in the mall to its partner triple five a company owned by four brothers raphael nader bahman and eskander ghermezian for 814 million that transaction would put triple five in charge of the mall a 42 million square foot shopping and entertainment complex that is the country 's largest the ghermezians who originated the idea for the mall and were awarded the right to develop the site in 1986 own an even bigger 53 million square foot mall in west edmonton alberta the judge who heard about nine weeks of testimony in the nonjury trial also ordered that triple five replace simon as managing general partner of the mall which is a mile and a half from minneapolis st paul international airport he also increased the ghermezians share of the management fees to 80 percent from 20 percent those fees are about 5 percent of the mall 's annual gross income or 5 million according to the ghermezians lawyer roger james magnuson who is not related to the judge the ruling calls for a special master to determine how much simon owes triple five including net profits resulting from its ownership interest in the mall since 1999 and those from the sale to ikea of a 15 acre site north of the mall in a statement issued yesterday from its indianapolis headquarters simon property said the company believes that the court 's order is legally and factually wrong the statement did not say whether the company would appeal les morris a company spokesman said only that the court order contained many inaccuracies but declined to elaborate simon now owns or has an interest in 239 properties in 36 states in conjunction with westfield america another shopping center developer simon has been engaged in a battle to take over a rival mall empire taubman centers for 174 billion simon 's shares closed at 4336 yesterday up 08 percent from 4315 mr magnuson a partner with dorsey whitney said his clients would add value to the mall but he said he did not expect the ghermezians to replace all of simon 's managers they do n't want to rattle any sabers or rock the boat he said nader ghermezian said in a statement that the company expected a smooth harmonious transition and a cooperative relationship with our partners the partners plan to expand the mall by developing a 43 acre site adjacent to the new ikea store which is under construction the partnership between triple five and simon then known as melvin simon and associates to develop the mall of america began in 1987 after the mall opened in 1992 teachers insurance annuity association the financial services company converted its 650 million construction loan into an equity loan and was given a 55 percent stake in the property with simon and triple five each owning 225 percent in june 1999 however teachers now known as tiaa cref sold half its interest to simon for about 318 million in their lawsuit buttressed by dozens of e mail messages letters and secretly recorded telephone conversations the ghermezians argued that not only did simon not tell them about the negotiations but that simon executives tried to intimidate them once they heard about the transaction during the trial simon contended that teachers did not want to deal with the ghermezians and said that triple five did not have the money to buy the 275 percent interest rejecting these arguments the judge said triple five had enough cash in 1999 to buy all of the interest sold to simon as late as december 1998 the judge said teachers thought that the ghermezians might be involved in the transaction triple five bears some responsibility for its strained relationship with its partner judge magnuson wrote but he said evidence in the trial showed that simon executives engaged in behavior that can best be characterized as boorish behavior one might expect to see on a playground but not in dealings between sophisticated business partners he added business people can not and must not ignore ethics fairness and sound judgment when ordering their affairs this case presents an example of a situation in which business expediency overshadowed the very high duties the law imposes on partners correction september 15 2003 monday an article in business day on friday about a judge 's order to transfer control of the mall of america from the simon property group to a canadian company triple five referred incorrectly to parties that were found to have breached their fiduciary duty to triple five they were melvin and herbert simon and si minn lp not simon property si minn is a subsidiary of melvin simon associates that is controlled by melvin and herbert simon who are also co chairmen of simon property the article also misstated the location of another large mall west edmonton owned by triple five it is in edmonton alberta there is no municipality of west edmonton
