 most music fans congregating in napster 's chat rooms yesterday afternoon were seeking an answer to a simple question as anongirl put it succinctly how long do we have besides setting off a stampede to download free music before it is too late yesterday 's decision by a three judge panel of the ninth circuit court of appeals in san francisco that napster should be prohibited from enabling the swapping of copyrighted music appeared to hand a significant victory to the recording industry in its crusade against internet piracy but the second most asked question among napster users yesterday may indicate that major record labels that sued napster for copyright infringement have a longer way to go to win in the court of public opinion jeffoboy15 's query does anyone know of any other programs for music transfer was echoed and answered by many others the answer is that there are several although none provide the wide range of music or the ease of use of napster much of the debate over napster has centered on whether consumers have a fair use right under copyright law to share music that they already own with whomever they saw fit whether it be one friend or napster 's 58 million users the court ruled yesterday that napster users were infringing copyrights in its decision the court said napster would be required to remove any copyrighted material that it was informed was being being traded through its service and officials at the recording industry association of america the trade group that sued napster on behalf of the major record companies talked of new technologies that would make it possible to identify the copyrighted songs stored on the computers of the individuals who make them available for other napster users to download and listen to but the extraordinary napster phenomenon has been fueled only in part by the technology that made it possible it is also based in the antipathy many users express toward the music industry and the sense that the cost of compact discs is far too high hey napster is stealing songs one participant in the alternative napster chat room wrote yesterday afternoon you must admit if there was no napster you would pay for cd 's another responded no i 'd just burn my friends cd 's the music industry is getting too much cash from kids to burn a cd is to transfer computer files onto a compact disc aware of the sentiments of the napster users some legal scholars who disagreed with parts of the ninth circuit 's decision said the ruling would ultimately work against the recording industry my view is that the riaa loses the battle and loses the war because they become the bad guys said lawrence lessig an expert on internet law at stanford university with every song they tell napster to remove the political resistance to this extreme view of copyright law will grow stronger napster with backing from the bertelsmann music group plans to make a subscription service available in the fall several legal experts said the court decision yesterday would probably encourage a settlement between napster and other major record labels which might enable napster to offer more music by subscription in the meantime however napster users may have to find other alternatives and judging from their online comments few seemed inclined to return to the record store the leading possible substitutes like gnutella and freenet are considerably harder to use but they are also harder to police because unlike napster they do not maintain a central index of users that share music files the developers of those programs said they did not see how the court ruling could be applied to them this is going to make life difficult for a lot of music swapping fans out there said gene kan a developer of gnutella but maybe the larger concern should be that there 's no above ground alternative for napster users in the sense that the music industry has not come forward with their own version of napster to allow people to swap files on line which is something they obviously want to do of the major record labels only bertelsmann has sought to build a fee based music sharing service by teaming with napster many napster users have said they are willing to pay a small fee to use the new service if it works as the current version does to provide access to much of the world 's music but few have expressed an abiding loyalty to napster as it goes mainstream and perhaps unfortunately for the music industry the ability to share digital music files in the mp3 format has acquired a certain subversive cachet that may be hard to shake if napster does shut down there are more sites out there obsidian tempest 24 a security guard and disc jockey in ontario wrote in an e mail message to a reporter and they may get a few but they ca n't stop all of them wes feltz 16 of pittsburgh wrote in an e mail message they 'll never stop mp3 's they 'll always exist i can upload mp3 's on my web site right now if i want to mr feltz for one is not worried about finding a napster alternative he said he had enough cd 's to listen to for now because over the six months that he has been using napster he has burned almost 70 separate discs
