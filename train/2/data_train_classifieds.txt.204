 a panel of experts appointed by schools chancellor harold o levy has recommended that a more demanding high school math curriculum be created for students who want it because it said current programs geared to state standards are not rigorous enough to meet the needs of thousands of college bound students the recommendation in a 52 page report released yesterday would restore a two track system just as the state board of regents has begun abolishing the old two track system beginning this spring all students who started ninth grade four years ago will be required to pass a state regents examination in math before they can graduate from high school the regents driven city and state math curriculum for all students leaves the most advanced ones as much as three years behind where they should be the panel said if they want to be ready for college level math science architecture nursing and even law which requires analytical thinking while the regents contend that the new graduation tests raise standards for everyone the panel gave the current math curriculum only a lukewarm endorsement calling it adequate for the time being the panel urged city schools to give college bound students in grades 9 through 11 the choice of a more traditional approach to math involving an emphasis on abstract thinking and mastery of standard mathematical rules known as algorithms more than half the 1100 city schools use a different approach called constructivism which encourages students to discover how to solve problems on their own rather than depending on formulas the content and scope of these courses should emphasize more extensively and in greater depth the logical formal and abstract aspects of mathematics the report found although buried in the jargon filled text of the report this particular section appears to be a cautiously worded critique of constructivist math which encourages students to rediscover centuries old mathematical principles for themselves using materials like beans and calculators to add fractions students taught by the constructivist approach might fold paper strips rather than reduce the numbers to the lowest common denominator at a news conference yesterday at board of education headquarters in brooklyn where the report was released mr levy said that he would follow up on the recommendation for an advanced track although aides said later that the new system would not necessarily be ready by this fall mr levy suggested that a two track option would provide an alternative to constructivist math without dictating curriculum and teaching methods he emphasized that it would be available to any student who was interested one shoe fits all for all students did not seem to me totally appropriate mr levy said alan ray a spokesman for the state education commissioner richard p mills said mr mills had no objection to advanced courses the regents requirements are supposed to be a floor not a ceiling he said adding that mr mills believed that they were an improvement over the graduation requirements of the past the panel started working in october matthew goldstein chancellor of the city university of new york was the chairman mr levy focused on pressing the case for more qualified math teachers a recommendation that had been included in a draft of the report that was released in april recruiting more qualified teachers of all kinds and paying them better have been mr levy 's top priorities the report blamed teachers inadequate training for city students low scores in math only 22 percent of city eighth graders passed last year 's state math test but 40 percent passed statewide the report did not provide statistics or even anecdotal evidence to support its contention that many math teachers are underqualified mr levy said the panel members did not visit classrooms the report was prepared by analyzing documents and talking to teachers his office later released statistics showing that 81 percent of math teachers in high school and 64 percent in junior high meet state certification standards some of the city 's most vocal critics of constructivist math said yesterday that they doubted that a two track program could be carried out fairly how will we select which children in high school are eligible for the reform said elizabeth carson a leader of that opposition and the mother of an eighth grade boy she said it was racist it is classist it is appalling not to give all students the best courses
