 while the ultimate tests of a presidency are the success or failure of its great endeavors speeches in times of crisis are critical rites of passage especially those meant to say we know what we 're doing it 's hard but we 're going to be all right ronald reagan met the test several times in telling the nation of responses to terrorism but his finest oratorical moment may have come on jan 29 1986 soon after a nation accustomed to routinely successful space flights saw the shuttle challenger explode in flames he spoke early at 5 pm to be sure to be heard by the nation 's children who knew that one of the crew had been christa mcauliffe a schoolteacher astronaut he spoke to them directly i know it 's hard to understand that sometimes painful things like this happen it 's all part of the process of exploration and discovery it 's all part of taking a chance and expanding man 's horizons the future does n't belong to the faint hearted it belongs to the brave the challenger crew was pulling us into the future and we 'll continue to follow them he ended in poetry quoting john gillespie magee jr a canadian air force pilot who died in a spitfire crash in 1941 mr reagan said the astronauts would be remembered as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of god john f kennedy often addressed a worried nation he gave great speeches on berlin and on civil rights but he had a singular challenge on oct 22 1962 he was not memorializing as bill clinton did after the oklahoma city bombing nor was he announcing a specific course of action as president george h w bush did when outlining the 1991 attack on iraq as bob shrum a speechwriter for top democrats for three decades put it mr kennedy 's task was not just to react but to define the event to which the country was reacting he laid out the problem soviet offensive missiles in cuba despite a pledge foreign minister andrei a gromyko had given him personally he explained the plan a blockade of cuba to halt delivery of any more military equipment and a warning that if a missile was fired the united states would strike at the soviet union and he closed with a determination that moved the nation noting that there was danger implicitly that of world war iii ahead the path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards as all paths are but it is the one most consistent with our character and courage as a nation and our commitments around the world the cost of freedom is always high and americans have always paid it and one path we shall never choose and that is the path of surrender of submission in the era of radio no one commanded national attention as strongly as franklin delano roosevelt starting on the day he took the oath of office it was the depths of the depression and he told his listeners the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance but perhaps his simplest and most forceful speech was delivered the day after pearl harbor when he told congress yesterday dec 7 1941 a date which will live in infamy the united states of america was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of japan he cataloged japan 's deceit and its ravages throughout the pacific but the point was to rally not educate since americans already knew of the attacks no matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion he said the american people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory like mr reagan 's peggy noonan and mr kennedy 's theodore c sorensen mr roosevelt had speechwriters but according to his biographer arthur m schlesinger robert e sherwood and samuel rosenman were both in new york on dec 7 1941 they caught the first train to washington but the president had already dictated his speech to his secretary grace tully on tuesday in the crisis of the moment some of president bush 's first comments seemed casual almost unscripted from sarasota he promised to hunt down those folks who committed this act at barksdale air force base he offered thanks for all the folks who have been fighting hard to rescue our fellow citizens he had a more organized message in the evening from the oval office but his delivery without much practice was not commanding even when he warned we will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbored them but three days later he spoke most effectively at the washington national cathedral where he said we are here in the middle hour of our grief so many have suffered so great a loss and today we express our nation 's sorrow he was firm when he said this nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger this conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing still his true test is ahead he will be judged both for oratory and policy by what he says when he goes on television some night soon to explain that the united states has just struck back correction september 23 2001 sunday an article last sunday about historic presidential speeches misstated the means by which two speechwriters for president franklin delano roosevelt rushed back to washington from new york after the japanese attack on pearl harbor the two robert e sherwood and samuel rosenman took a plane not a train
