 mayor michael r bloomberg and gov george e pataki are suddenly at odds over tens of millions of dollars in homeland defense money that congress is poised to approve with each man lobbying at the other 's expense in washington for a larger share of the aid the dueling messages from albany and city hall come at an extremely sensitive time with leaders on capitol hill working out the final details on how to best allocate as much as 1 billion in federal aid to help the most vulnerable states and localities defend themselves against terrorist attacks lawmakers in both parties said the governor 's aides were furiously working the phones yesterday trying to change a formula that gives new york city 80 percent of any money that will be doled out to new york state the governor believes the state should have a larger share mr bloomberg meanwhile was pressing lawmakers to preserve that very same formula one that his aides and other lawmakers insist he helped create through his persistence and persuasive lobbying in washington in recent weeks the aides said bloomberg administration officials were astounded at mr pataki 's move all of the legislators we talked to in washington were sympathetic about giving at least 80 percent to the city said a senior new york city police official we are very very angry about this attempt to shift money away from where the threat is mayor bloomberg has ostentatiously declined to criticize mr pataki even as the governor has refused the mayor 's request for more state aid blocked the city 's plan to impose a commuter tax and proposed a budget that would cut millions a year to schools and health care programs even when pressed by other city and legislative leaders mr bloomberg has maintained that he would rather quietly negotiate with the governor whom he strongly supported in the last election than pick public fights and cause a political commotion honey is his favorite analogy for his methodology but with both the city and state facing huge deficits and dismal revenue projections the two republicans are at loggerheads over this expected pot of federal money aides to the mayor said mr bloomberg called mr pataki after his successful trip to washington to relay the good news but the governor immediately began complaining about the 80 20 split people close to mr pataki confirmed that the governor was upset about the formula the rift between the city and state has opened at a critical moment on tuesday the house appropriations committee approved a bill that would give 700 million to localities considered to be at high risk of a terror attack a similar spending bill is being hammered out in the senate though democrats have raised the stakes by seeking a little more than 1 billion for high risk localities both houses are expected to pass a bill perhaps within the week that would allocate the money tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to places like new york city and washington which are considered at high risk of another attack and are taking extensive steps to protect themselves the high risk money is on top of at least 15 billion that congress is expected to divide among the states based on population the house measure gained momentum after furious lobbying efforts by mr bloomberg who persuaded both democrats and republicans that new york is a special case and has incurred great expense   in the midst of the worst fiscal crisis in a generation to protect itself against future attacks but mr pataki is arguing that the state is also spending an inordinate amount to protect itself and that most of its expenses are incurred in bolstering the city in the midst of its own desperate financial situation with an 115 billion deficit new york state is spending 75 million a week on security measures the governor 's aides said state officials said the state is spending 25 million a week for increased patrols in subways grand central terminal penn station and other transit hubs 2 million a week for increased port authority patrols in new york city particularly at the airports 21 million a week for an increased state police and national guard presence at power plants transit hubs and new york city reservoirs across the state a lot of the state 's costs are being incurred by the port authority and the mta said one pataki official yesterday mr pataki 's administration was lobbying aides to tom ridge the secretary of homeland security and leaders on capitol hill to have the formula changed so that the state would be eligible for more than 20 percent at the very least the governor 's allies argued the funds should be disbursed at the discretion of mr ridge who in turn could decide where the genuine need is we do n't think 20 percent would be adequate said one person close to the governor the governor 's actions have left the bloomberg administration seething switching to that formula does not bear any relationship to where the threat is said a senior new york city police official he said every briefing indicates that new york city is a target of terrorists and it is not the state that is carrying the bulk of the protection load we are very unhappy the police official said told of the city 's unhappiness lisa dewald stoll a spokeswoman for the governor said the governor continues to work with mayor bloomberg to advocate on behalf of both the city and the state to insure that there are adequate funds to protect the people of new york city the surrounding areas and communities throughout the state meanwhile the governor was facing a greater hurdle in the senate where his aides said democrats were proposing a formula that could cut states out entirely and give all of the 1 billion pot they were proposing in homeland security funding to localities mr pataki himself called new york 's senior senator charles e schumer a democrat today expressing his concerns some congressional representatives said they were sympathetic to mr bloomberg who was summoned to washington from the opening day baseball game at shea stadium on monday by congressman john e sweeney to make his case to key members of the committee i think the mayor was strongly influential in getting this done mr sweeney said yesterday today the full house is expected to vote on the appropriations bill and several members of the new york delegation predicted that the state to city ratio would remain as written i would suspect that someone may come to the floor with an amendment to reconfigure the formula said mr sweeney but i do n't expect that they will be very successful
