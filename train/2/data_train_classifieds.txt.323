 with a play reading actors read the words aloud the audience reacts one playwright will stand onstage cloaked by the curtain watching intently as the audience laughs was there a laugh there he asks himself nervously checking the script another may walk over to the chinese restaurant across the street for him the reaction any reaction is just too much to bear he 'll wait for the exit poll playwrights are sweating out the birth of their plays at the bendheim performing arts center in scarsdale monday nights through the spring painful as a first reading may be it does n't compare with the possibilities for the program following michael taub a professor of judaic studies at purchase college mediates a discussion with the playwright the director the cast and for all frustrated armchair critics the audience for some playwrights the audience interaction is a gift 'that 's really the exciting part of it said bruce bloom of southold on long island a marketing consultant and longtime member of the greenville community theater mr bloom 's best meal you ever ate is next on the block dec 4 to have an interactive thing with the audience is something you do n't get every often mr bloom said mostly the lights come up and they get up and leave you want to be able to see the audience response to certain lines turns of the plot does it all work of course they may say your baby 's ugly what are you going to do if they make a valid point then i have a basis for going back and making it better and if it 's absolutely a bomb then i throw it away and start another one for the playwright the anxiety the pain and the applause are all part of a play 's birthing process said leslie wiesen the artistic director of the bendheim and assistant director of the jewish community center of mid westchester of which the bendheim is a part this is a tightrope to walk she said you 're raw you are out there some people are better at it than others the playwright for the oct 16 reading of the last jew of boyle heights steve greenstein avoided the tightrope altogether he stopped audience members if he sensed they were going to criticize the play for me it was to hear my own work said mr greenstein a bronx native who divides his time between new jersey and los angeles to get up there and hear feedback from the audience i 'm too vulnerable a lot of people say way off base things and it 's an unfair place to put the writer the audience has to understand that they are in a very ground level place a growth place but people love to play the critic mr greenstein had other issues to cope with his director quit forcing him to direct the night before the reading appendicitis struck an actor that forced mr greenstein to act too both jobs made it challenging for him to play the playwright although he called the opportunity a positive experience ms wiesen and the bendheim 's managing director barbara lavery choose the plays this year 10 were submitted the bendheim 's staff is small so it has relied primarily upon word of mouth to advertise the selection process to avoid being overwhelmed for obvious reasons the bendheim tends to get plays with jewish themes the best meal you ever ate tells the story of jean paul a celebrated chef who makes his way through the rubble of the jewish ghetto to create an exquisite meal for avrim and netti the last remaining jews fighting the nazis the setting for the last jew of boyle heights is an area in los angeles that was once the largest jewish community west of the mississippi the disputation occurs in spain during the middle ages when christians and jews publicly debated ideas it is a screenplay adaptation by andrzej krakowski and andrzej wohl from a play by hyam maccoby and will be read april 2 just one play james b nicola 's donuts and discussion to be read feb 12 addresses issues beyond jewish culture a 16 year old boy who is committed to a mental institution for shooting his classmate meets with his lawyer perhaps most important in the choice of a play ms wiesen said is the presence of a strong voice we want a play that says something interesting to the community that is of social value or the best laugh you ever had she said do we think this is something that needs a lot of work and would benefit from a sophisticated audience this is the second season for the monday play readings the goal is to gain exposure for the playwrights work and to increase awareness of the field of american jewish drama a field open to good work whether or not it has a social message mr taub said it 's an ongoing debate should a play that says a lot but is weak get preference over a good play with less weighty subject matter mr taub said a good quality play is definitely the one that should be chosen over one that is bad but has a great deal of substance people want audiences who want satisfaction me i like the good plays bendheim performing arts center jcc of mid westchester 999 wilmot road scarsdale the
