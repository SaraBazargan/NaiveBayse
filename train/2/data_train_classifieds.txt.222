 hoping to stem the purchase of fake police badges that could be used by terrorists representative anthony d weiner said yesterday that he would introduce a bill to restrict their sale nationwide new york state law prohibits the purchase of police badges real or fake by civilians although a bill passed in 2000 by congress made it a federal crime to sell replica badges across state lines they can still be legally purchased by someone wishing to use them for recreational purposes within the state where they are bought badges nearly identical to those worn by new york police department and new york state police lieutenants are available over the internet for 2995 those for higher ranking officials sell for about 80 the gleam of these fake badges is often enough to trick unknowing civilians each year the new york police department receives more than 1200 complaints about someone impersonating a police officer officials said there are people using fake badges to commit very real crimes mr weiner a democrat representing parts of brooklyn and queens said yesterday during a news conference as he held up a fake new york police sergeant 's badge alongside an authentic one mr weiner pointed out that the two were nearly identical from the golden hue to the span of the eagle 's wings you 'd have a very hard time determining which is the real sergeant and which is the sergeant who found his identity on the internet he said most web sites that sell the fake badges ask buyers to click a button saying that they intend to use them legally but there is nothing that these web site operators do to ensure that you are indeed following the rules mr weiner said the prohibition on purchasing fake badges is completely toothless he said and in this age of heightened awareness of terrorism we simply can not allow these things to continue a study by the general accounting office in 2000 found that plainclothes officers showing fake badges easily gained access to federal buildings including the headquarters of the cia the fbi and the justice department as well as the pentagon they were not searched or asked for additional identification this is a virtual pass for terrorists mr weiner said you can almost be any rank you want the potential for trouble is particularly acute in new york city which has nearly 40000 police officers mr weiner said in smaller communities he said officers are more widely known the president of the sergeants benevolent association in new york ed mullins voiced his support for the bill which would require anyone wishing to buy a fake badge including television movie and theater producers to submit an application to the applicable police department detailing what it would be used for collectors would only be able to buy badges encased in lucite
