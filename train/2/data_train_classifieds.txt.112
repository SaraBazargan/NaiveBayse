 in a way josh pais was always looking for rino thunder in the early 1970 's when mr pais was a child rino thunder was well known in alphabet city for his penetrating eyes and waves of silvery hair some said he was trying to be an actor mr pais who lived with his artist mother lila in a ground floor apartment on east seventh street between avenues c and d usually knew where to find mr thunder a lanky american indian he would be walking his mangy dogs around the block or telling jokes in his rooftop apartment across the street for a time mr thunder and lila pais were lovers the boy already had a father in abraham pais a quiet physicist who lived on the upper east side and had once worked with albert einstein but whenever life on seventh street got dangerous as it often did in those days josh pais felt that rino thunder would protect him so would manny schwartzberg a grizzled foot soldier in the jewish mafia who lived a few doors down so would mickey the block 's con man and merlin the block 's hippie sage mr pais cherished the block he shared with these characters and it is their stories that fill his new documentary 7th street which opened friday at cinema village the film examines mr pais 's own past while chronicling the history of the block from salt marsh to bohemian outpost to crack den to real estate gem i could 've shot the whole east village because it was and is my neighborhood mr pais said after a critic 's screening of the film the other day but seventh street is precious to me the 72 minute film revolves around mr pais 's story so he brushes lightly over the block 's early history with voiceovers and vintage photographs but to document the block of his lifetime he relies on oral history weaving a jumpy succession of street interviews with news clippings and grainy color views of the former ghetto latin and tribal music wafts in and out mr pais a 38 year old actor who resembles ben stiller makes an earnest narrator with his new film mr pais joins a long list of new york filmmakers with a fondness for one classic city spot or another martin scorsese has his vicious five points woody allen his rose colored carnegie hill nora ephron her combative upper west side but mr pais confesses a dedication to seventh street between avenues c and d that borders on obsession he spent 10 years filming the block which today is lined with prim row houses some old some new along with wrought iron railings and spindly trees when he began filming in 1992 he knew that outsiders saw the street only as an anonymous stretch between tompkins square and the jacob riis houses a low income project he knew that local residents often claimed the jazz musician charlie parker as the block 's only past superstar resident and that parker had actually lived around the corner on avenue b even so mr pais could not escape the feeling that his ever changing block merited remembrance territories tend to be small and fluid in this city and he worried that some day he 'd look around for mr thunder and the rest and find strangers there was just some need in me to go out and film them he said to hang onto them before they all vanished when mr pais and his mother moved to seventh street in 1967 josh was 3 and the block seemed unlikely to evoke nostalgia arsonists plagued its boarded up buildings and its cars police officers were a rare sight east of second avenue two years earlier a riot had broken out on the block and several residents had been injured racial tensions bubbled as hungarian jews were replaced by blacks and puerto ricans into this mix came counterculture thinkers artists draft dodgers and musicians many of whom found refuge in the pais home mr pais spent weekends uptown with his father where he wore a jacket to dinner and listened to nobel laureates pontificate but he was shy and preferred seventh street where he could play stickball with a childhood friend named angel or listen to the philosophical ramblings of merlin a bearded hippie who used to sit on the sidewalk later mr pais befriended mickey and john two bit con men who hung out in front of a hungarian hangout called vasac hall he always asked to tag along whenever rino thunder or manny schwartzberg who had moved to seventh street in 1945 left the block to run errands growing up mr pais said i started to realize i was surrounded by people who were passionately alive seventh street felt raw but i found it incredibly theatrical mr pais did n't learn about the riot on the block however until long after he had graduated from dalton where he went at his father 's insistence and attended acting classes in london he moved briefly to hollywood and played the part of raphael in the 1990 movie teenage mutant ninja turtles fourteen movies later that role is still his largest though he may be familiar to law and order fans as borak an assistant medical examiner in 1992 having married the actress lisa emery and moved back to seventh street where he lives today mr pais decided to buy an 800 hi 8 video camera and trail a few of his favorite local characters rino thunder who had just played the kooky role of owatonna in the 1991 spoof hot shots liked the idea so did mr pais 's father josh pais never intended to film for more than a few years but even as the stacks of videotapes piled up in his apartment he felt that he needed more footage crack had ravaged his block but there were flickering signs of recovery perhaps even gentrification he filmed in spurts between acting jobs until 1995 when a local drug lord threatened to harm mr pais 's wife and young son if the camera work continued it stopped three years later police arrested the drug lord and mr pais bought a digital camera he filmed and filmed knowing that his original cast of characters was already dwindling last spring he sent a final cut to cinema village a small theater on east 12th street which agreed to show it the documentary also won a spot in the american film institute festival in los angeles after last week 's screening he wandered from the theater over to tompkins square and his block today many of its buildings are adorned with scaffolding or new coats of paint the block echoes with hammers and renovation crime is lower and rents are much higher at the park mr pais stopped looked around and seeing no one familiar shuffled on in many ways his love letter to his childhood has become a eulogy manny merlin mickey ray his parents all have since died and what of rino thunder he was evicted from his apartment a few years back mr pais said and his dogs died mr pais found him a place at a brooklyn nursing home but mr thunder did not stay there for long he felt too confined mr pais said too far removed from seventh street since then the now shriveled mr thunder has split his time between tompkins park and city shelters he is such a role model to me and it 's hard mr pais said i keep trying to find him a new place but he wo n't go 'this is home he tells me and i ca n't change that
