 liane le tendre does not work for google the operator of the web 's most popular search engine but she depends on google for her income the google search engine directs more than 3000 people a day to ms le tendre 's web site bareboatsbvicom for her brokerage service for yacht charters in the british virgin islands her four year old company has always relied on web visitors but the traffic used to come from a wide range of search sites now the visitors who arrive from google generate about 85 percent of her business providing her with a comfortable living and because her site shows up prominently in the search engine 's free listings for queries like british virgin islands yacht she has never had to pay google a penny ms le tendre says she assumes that there are many thousands of proprietors like herself who are dependent on google traffic for their incomes i could n't even guess at the amount of sales generated by google she said but i would imagine it would be sufficient to run a good sized country think of it as the google economy much as ebay spawned an army of entrepreneurial auctioneers google has become enough of a web gatekeeper that its leads now prop up plenty of commercial sites companies can pay google to promote their sites although the paid listings are labeled as such and are listed separately from the unpaid results but many smaller merchants in specialized niches like ms le tendre 's rely on their sites turning up in google 's free search results google uses many variables in its automated ranking process but a key one is the number of other pages linking to a particular page because links can serve as a kind of endorsement google regularly shuffles its rankings to reflect changes in its own methods or in the web 's link structure and content that makes its free listings a risky platform on which to build a business google also routinely slashes the rankings of sites that appear to be using tricks like hiding keywords in invisible text that can be read only by search engines but it is hard to discourage those who see good positioning in google 's search results as the path to riches on webmasterworld com and other discussion boards site owners and consultants gather to exchange tips on the black art of what is known as search engine optimization and to analyze google 's every hiccup traffic from search engines is especially important to small sites that unlike those of amazoncom or gap do not have the brand recognition to attract shoppers on their own only about 15 percent of consumers used a search engine to locate their most recent online purchase according to carrie a johnson a senior analyst at forrester research and yet search engine users tend to be more technically savvy she said those are the people who spend the most money online a common complaint on webmaster discussion sites is that google through deals to provide its search results to yahoo america online and other partners controls too large a share of the search market the complaints grew louder in october when yahoo demoted its own directory listings and gave more prominence to google 's results with its partner sites included google is now responsible for about three quarters of all search engine traffic to web sites according to the research firm statmarket because of this power google can be your best friend or your worst enemy said dario ferreira the owner and operator of connecticut weddingscom and similar wedding portals for other states sergey brin one of google 's founders and its president of technology acknowledged that google 's large market share can leave web site owners vulnerable to fluctuations in traffic but he was unapologetic about google 's success and its emphasis on keeping users happy even at the expense of webmasters the only reason people come to google is because it works for them he said sometimes a site 's ranking plunges drastically or disappears from google altogether often this means that google detected some evidence that the site 's owner was using deceptive tactics like building a network of linked sites to create the illusion of popularity and thereby receive a higher ranking but site owners say google can sometimes be overzealous in its fight against manipulation and some say they live in fear that a small mistake or a technical glitch will get them booted from the search results and wipe out their income ms le tendre the yacht broker for example said she was building separate sites for two new branches of her business just in case nancy bernardine a jewelry maker in cincinnati who sells her work online said she did not know for certain why google dropped her site from its index a year and a half ago resulting in a 75 percent drop in her web traffic she did several things that she said she now knows are frowned upon by google like using software that monitors a site 's rankings although she has stopped using the software and has sent e mail messages to google many times she says she has received only generic responses and that her site has made only a partial recovery in search results she says she believes google may still be punishing her somehow i 've groveled i 've apologized i 've acknowledged my sins she said but still nothing google officials declined to comment on specific cases but mr brin said google 's staff was trying to be responsive to queries and complaints from site owners by participating in online forums and answering some portion of the mountains of e mail it receives google also looks for trends in such messages that might warrant changes in the company 's software algorithms he said online merchants can guarantee their appearance on google 's search pages by signing up with google 's advertising programs they can ensure placement on other search sites by using similar services from companies like overture services which supplies paid listings to msn search and others these keyword targeted ads have been popular with advertisers and lucrative for search engines but merchants who have learned how to do well in the free listings through careful use of keywords and site structure say they receive more traffic through the nonpaid methods allan pollett who lives near toronto and runs an online art dealer ucanbuyartcom said paid listings with the search services yahoo and looksmart had failed to bring in much business the same was true of magazine and television ads he said i got more visitors from google than i got from any of those other outlets and i could do it for free he said the free ride may not last however ms johnson of forrester says larger companies have been discovering the power of search engines and site optimization as was the case on ebay when big retailers moved in search listings are becoming less democratic it 's going to be more and more difficult for small sellers to get noticed she said the free listings lunch may be ending soon
