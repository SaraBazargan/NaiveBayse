 the opposition northern alliance mobilized at least three attack units north of kabul today in what could be the first sign of an offensive against taliban forces on the front line here alliance commanders declined to discuss the move but soldiers in the units said at least 900 special attack troops had been ordered to report to their bases for duty they said they expected to be assaulting taliban lines near here within days in recent days alliance officials have said they will curtail their military operations during the islamic holy month of ramadan which begins in mid november the two sides have fought through the holy month in the past but alliance officials fear that if they attack during ramadan that might turn muslim opinion against them that leaves two and a half weeks for the alliance to stage attacks in this area which is 35 miles north of kabul as well as around the strategic cities of mazar i sharif and taliqan there appeared to be little military activity around taliqan today and alliance attacks in mazar i sharif have slowed in recent days at 11 am today col abdul jalil surveyed 300 of the assault troops as they stood in formation at their base in the village of tutumdara the colonel and his soldiers appeared comfortable confident and relaxed we have had a few days off he said referring to a recent leave we are ready if the alliance attacks here it faces a difficult task an estimated 5000 to 10000 taliban soldiers man a maze of pillboxes mine fields and trenches on the other side of the front line alliance forces here are believed to number between 3000 and 5000 american jets have been bombing front line positions across northern afghanistan for eight days but alliance commanders have complained that the strikes have not been heavy or continuous enough to weaken the enemy sufficiently the bombs they complained have been dispersed among taliban targets in kabul mazar i sharif and taliqan rather than being concentrated to pound a single front line repeatedly if they do pierce the taliban line alliance officials have promised to advance only as far as the outskirts of kabul they would then wait for a local or international security force to enter the city the success of any offensive will depend largely on units like the one colonel abdul commands called zarbati or rapid they were created by the alliance 's former military commander ahmed shah massoud who was assassinated last month general massoud tried to replace an army made up primarily of local militia forces who were haphazardly armed wore no uniforms and were loyal primarily to their local commanders the soldiers in the zarbati units are volunteers who are paid twice as much as their comrades given uniforms and placed in units comprising troops from different parts of the country they receive six months of training and live on military bases instead of at home today the zarbati soldiers in tutumdara seemed almost relieved to have been called up they are a mix of old and young muhammad naim a 40 year old who said he had 20 years of combat experience dating to the soviet intervention here proudly explained that he was his unit 's rocket man he is responsible for handling the 10 man squad 's rocket propelled grenade he said he had destroyed or disabled 10 tanks with the weapon at noon abdel nasir ziai a political officer showed up to give the soldiers a speech he praised the men who had recently served for four months in northern afghanistan for their work there he told the soldiers they were fighting terrorism and foreign invaders a reference to the pakistani and arab volunteers who fight alongside the taliban and are vilified here he told the soldiers they were fighting for afghanistan 's right to control its destiny and for a multiethnic democratic country he then invoked the memory of general massoud and concluded by wishing the men well as i see you happy here today i hope i 'll see you the same way in the squares of kabul he said all the civilians in kabul are waiting for you it is difficult to judge how well these soldiers might fare against the dizzying array of fortifications built along this front line in six years of fighting several soldiers said they would be able to break the line using their training any attack is likely to be at night and led by special teams that will first clear a path in the mine fields for soldiers squads of 10 will then move in and try to seize trenches and bunkers but it will be very difficult for the soldiers to have any element of surprise since the american bombing began and as it continued tonight small arms fire has flared along the front line with the taliban soldiers firing at the slightest hint of a northern alliance advance but aqapacha a 27 year old soldier in the unit said he was confident that they could breach taliban defenses he is a specialist with a pikati a powerful russian made rifle that can fire about 2800 yards the young soldier known as his squad 's pika man showed the same confidence and high spirits as other soldiers when asked how well he could shoot his weapon if you want go sit 1000 meters away from me he said i 'll shoot you
