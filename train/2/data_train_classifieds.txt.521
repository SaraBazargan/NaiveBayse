 on the golf course this year paul willey was virtually unstoppable in november with thousands of golf fans from around the world glued to their screens willey put the finishing touches on a historic season defeating mike schuetz in a hawaiian tournament that earned him a cool 100000 a 37 year old military veteran from palmyra me willey won 40 of 50 tournaments he took part in this year and 47 of 71 tournaments last year during his spectacular run willey has become a celebrity far beyond the links of his small town in some golf circles people are even chatting about willey in the same sentence as tiger woods after all while woods has been filling the competition green with envy and his pockets green with cash willey has been playing out of this world it 's an honor to be compared to tiger willey said i guess the one thing that the two of us have in common is the determination to win tiger and i do not like finishing second but there are a few things that tiger woods and paul willey do not have in common willey has multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair and while woods swings a golf club to fuel his passion willey clicks on a computer mouse to fuel his champions of cyberspace like willey are slowly creeping onto the sports landscape when willey captured microsoft 's 100000 virtual golf association championship taking home the largest purse awarded for an online tournament he made national headlines not only had willey outdueled more than 12000 online competitors to earn a trip to hawaii to compete in the finals he had also done it without getting a single blister the whole thing has kind of been like a dream said willey who was handed his hefty paycheck by the former san francisco 49ers quarterback joe montana i still kind of do n't believe i won it all willey was born into a family of golf enthusiasts both of his parents golf and his sister thea davis is a local teaching pro willey has been ranked no 1 in the virtual world since he started playing pc golf as it is known in 1996 a year after retiring from military duty because of his multiple sclerosis i started spending more time on the computer willey said then one day i discovered a competitive golf site looked at the leader boards and told my wife 'i could beat those scores four years later willey a father of two has become the tiger woods of cyberspace where he is shooting in the low 50 's willey said he had been approached by one company to endorse its merchandise he is seriously thinking about hiring an agent to help place him in high profile big money tournaments and to help him make the most of his market value it sounds crazy willey said but the time is fast approaching when certain cyberathletes can actually make a living playing sports on a computer while agents like scott boras are not about to put clients like alex rodriguez on hold to talk to champs like willey anytime soon the increasing popularity of computer games is in fact setting the stage for gaming officials to create more tournaments in other sports with large prize money attached in this new cyberage that is now dawning there are definitely cyberathletes that have just as great hand eye coordination and mind body coordination as our traditional athletes said walter day president of twin galaxies which is considered an online authority on player rankings scoring and record keeping day said more contests would probably be held in the coming year and that his company would name video game champions for several sports willey said it would benefit the michael jordan of cyberspace to log a few minutes on a real basketball court and for the virtual version of mike tyson to know his way around an actual boxing ring i 'm a much better online golfer because i play the real game once in a while and the skills i take from the virtual game i 'm able to apply on a real golf course said willey who shoots in the high 90 's on a real course when i 'm online and i 'm swinging a club i have a better feel for the flight of the ball and how it 's going to act when it lands on the greens and when i 'm playing real golf i have a better idea at how to handle my trouble shots last year i was on a course and my ball was under a few trees 80 yards from the greens i stopped for a moment and thought to myself 'online i would just take a 4 iron put the ball back in my stance and punch it out of there so i did it and the ball landed on the green about 10 feet from the cup willey and day agree that a scenario in which children will one day participate in football or baseball practice by coming home from school and simply turning on their computers is more likely to take place in a galaxy far far away but both insist that cyberathletes being able to earn money without taking an elbow under a basket without being spiked at second base or checked hard into the boards are the wave of the near future i 'm all for kids getting out and playing ball in the sun but hey if you want to be great at anything including cybersports you have to put in the practice time day said and i predict that one day very soon we will see more great champions like paul willey
