 like most of us ann hamman is deluged with mail offering preapproved credit cards and various lines of credit from banks and financial services companies large and small gold cards platinum cards titanium cards credit lines of as much as 100000 unlike most of us however mrs hamman 93 never sees them that is because she has been in an assisted living residence in homestead fla for more than a year she suffers from memory problems and needs help with daily activities she can not prepare meals or manage a bank account her mail goes to her son henry hamman who lives nearby in miami and mr hamman who has his mother 's power of attorney says he is appalled at the mail solicitations she receives when you market indiscriminately to the elderly and the susceptible i think it 's pretty reprehensible he said this is the financial equivalent of handing a loaded gun to a kid he is particularly angry about a check mrs hamman received from household bank in las vegas a subsidiary of household international the check was for 150002 all mrs hamman had to do was endorse it and presto the money would be hers along with a legal obligation to repay the loan in monthly installments of 5572 for 48 months that means that she would repay 267456 which translates to an annual interest rate of 31945 percent more than four times the prime rate if this check had fallen into her hands it 's entirely conceivable that she might have used it and not really known what she was doing mr hamman said celeste murphy director of investor relations at household international which is based in prospect heights ill said her company did not specifically single out older people for such solicitations she agreed that the 31945 percent rate offered mrs hamman was stunning mr hamman was also puzzled that many of the offers cited his mother 's excellent credit history as a reason for offering her up to 100000 of credit she does n't have any credit he said she has no assets other than her pension and social security and has n't owned a home since the 1960 's either there is a credit report mix up or this is the biggest bunch of hooey i 've ever seen a spokeswoman in washington for the american bankers association a lobbying group said that members look at creditworthiness before making credit card offers mrs hamman grew up in oklahoma and during world war ii was a lieutenant in the women 's army corps serving in italy and algeria she later worked in indiana as a consumer education agent and as a food editor at the evansville courier after retiring she served in the peace corps in belize for two years she 's always been a very independent person who stood up for folks who could n't stand up for themselves mr hamman said these credit offers would upset her because of the damage they can do to people who are n't financially sophisticated the seemingly personal solicitations can also prove seductive to the psychologically vulnerable mrs hamman is lucky that she has her son to look out for her in these matters many older people who are on their own especially if they are homebound lonely or confused can easily fall victim to such practices that while not illegal are certainly questionable travis b plunkett the legislative director of the consumer federation of america based in washington said indiscriminate and reckless marketing had become the rule in the credit card industry which last year mailed out a record 35 billion solicitations while members of this industry are asking congress to make bankruptcy more restrictive they have actually increased their solicitations and lines of credit he said referring to a bill pending in congress that would make it harder for people to erase their debts their business model the way they profit is to make risky loans to people who often do n't have the financial skills to know whether it 's right or not he added they 'll give a credit card to anything that moves consider the case involving the late doug x ping doug was a shar pei who was struck by a car and killed in 1994 when he was 5 the dog 's brooklyn owner who had brought him to the united states from china later put the pet 's name on some random consumer survey earlier this year doug received a solicitation from first usa bank in wilmington del for a national geographic society platinum mastercard with a solid line of credit of up to 100000 a spokesman for first usa bank which is a member of the banking association and a unit of bank one said we make every effort to ensure that the offers we mail out go to credit eligible adults if you 're not a dog you can take some steps to limit the number of mail solicitations you receive for a 5 fee the web site of the direct marketing association wwwthe dmaorg consumers allows you to remove your
