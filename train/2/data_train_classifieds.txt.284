 should the owners of a company be allowed to have a say when a company hands out millions of stock options the owners of mentor graphics a software company decided this week that they wanted to be heard on the subject a shareholder proposal sponsored by the big institutional money manager tiaa cref won the support of 572 percent of stockholders according to the preliminary tally reached yesterday mentor is the first company whose shareholders have adopted such a resolution said patrick connor a spokesman for tiaa cref a mentor spokesman declined to say whether the company would comply with that proposal which is nonbinding it 's premature to talk about that the spokesman ryerson schwark said but we heard loud and clear what the shareholders said under current rules at both nasdaq where mentor is traded and the new york stock exchange companies do not need to submit most option plans for shareholder approval few companies allow such votes many companies have fought bitterly against efforts to change their rules contending that they need the flexibility to grant options quickly to attract or keep valuable employees companies could seek shareholder approval for plans that had such options available but many prefer not to mentor is unusual in that it even allowed its owners to vote on the proposal which said that shareholders request the board of directors to submit all equity compensation plans and amendments to add shares to those plans for approval by the stockholders it did not have to do so the chairman of the securities and exchange commission harvey l pitt said last month that new rules were needed that would force companies to put to a vote of shareholders any plan that provides options to senior management he did not address whether all plans had to be voted on before the speech the sec 's corporation finance division had supported four companies that refused to allow their shareholders to vote on similar proposals from tiaa cref adobe systems cadence design systems autodesk and synopsys the sec concluded that option plans were compensation matters requiring no shareholder approval a spokeswoman for mr pitt christi harlan said last night that he would not comment on specific cases and she noted that tiaa cref had appealed the decision on the four companies but she said that in mr pitt 's opinion in general on compensation issues letting shareholders have a vote is in the best interests of the company and management ms harlan added that mr pitt would not vote on the appeal because tiaa cref had been a client of his when he was a lawyer in private practice before joining the commission under the former sec chairman arthur levitt the commission tried and failed to persuade the stock markets to require more shareholder votes on options the cost of stock options is a contentious one in many ways the tiaa cref proposal noted that in 2000 mentor graphics granted options on 47 million shares more than 7 percent of the outstanding shares during the year it said shareholders should be consulted when there was a possibility of substantial dilution of their stakes in urging shareholders to reject the proposal mentor said there had been little dilution it noted that the average exercise price of options issued during the year was 1736 and that it had reduced the possibility of dilution by repurchasing three million shares of common stock at an average price of 1762 not much higher than the option price mentor did not note that in 2001 its share repurchases cost 2447 a share 21 percent more than the 2020 exercise price of the options it issued nor did it note that the options actually exercised in each year options that had been issued in previous years were at prices far below the price the company paid to buy back shares in trading yesterday mentor rose 69 cents to 1812 companies that try to buy back shares to offset their stock options do reduce the risk of dilution but at a cost if the share price does not rise the options will never be exercised and the company will have paid for shares at prices that turn out to be high even if the options are eventually exercised the company will have put out cash in the intervening years but to shareholder democracy advocates the matter is not whether options are a good idea it is whether the owners of a company should have a voice on the matter as it stands now the sec has ruled that companies do not have to allow even advisory votes
