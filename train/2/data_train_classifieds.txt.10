 sometimes success in television turns to failure faster than a teenager can change channels this is an especially painful truth at vh1 these days once a cultural force for baby boomers vh1 is not just a fading music channel with a ratings slide it has become a major worry for viacom its parent company that is why viacom has brought in the mtv programming president brian graden a cable wunderkind known to have an uncanny eye for hit programs it hopes he will be able to pull off the delicate balancing act of trying to reach what it considers the ideal broad vh1 audience those in their mid 20 's who have graduated beyond the pierced bubble gum pop of mtv through those who remember swimming in the mud of woodstock the first time industry executives will be watching closely mr graden 's touch in the late 1990 's brought new hits to basic cable that broke the old rules with raw anything goes humor and ultimately pushed the barriers of taste for all television when the pop culture history of the last decade is written it will certainly not leave out graden backed projects like south park on comedy central and jackass and the osbournes at mtv a lot is riding on the continued success of mr graden 's golden instincts for viacom in the last two years vh1 an important revenue generator has failed to develop any new hits instead relying on old shows like behind the music the biography program about rock stars from days gone by 80 's sensations milli vanilli motley crue def leppard in the meantime its average audience decreased more than 20 percent in the past year to 200000 people last quarter with even worse dips in key demographic categories some weeks that has cost viacom tens of millions of dollars in rebates to advertisers who did not reach as large an audience as vh1 had promised and were compensated with free spots with so much advertising time filled with those give backs vh1 ran out of room to accommodate everyone viacom was forced to find time on its healthier networks like mtv and tnn officials said mel karmazin the president of viacom was not pleased suddenly one of viacom 's proudest assets had become a serious liability even as its younger skewing music channel sibling mtv climbed to historic highs there is wide consensus in the television industry that mr graden with help from vh1 's new general manager christina norman is the right person to right the ship his responsibilities were extended to vh1 last week by judy mcgrath the mtv networks music group president who took charge of vh1 when john sykes the former vh1 president was put in charge of infinity radio in march mr graden effectively replaces fred graver head vh1 programmer for a year there is considerable fear within mtv networks that mr graden a harvard mba may be spread too thin and that the division of his attention could hurt both vh1 and mtv but that seems to be counterbalanced by general impatience for a recovery at vh1 it 's a drag on everybody said one viacom executive ms mcgrath said mtv was humming along so well that mr graden would have ample time to focus on his new charge people inside and outside viacom often take jabs at vh1 referring to the cobwebs hanging on the behind the music and before they were rock stars franchises and blame an over reliance on those shows for vh1 's problems they just basically ran their hits into the ground said larry gerbrandt chief content officer of kagan world media a media research firm but current and former viacom executives said that after so many years building a rock solid brand identity for vh1 its leadership erred recently in trying to make the network so long considered a haven for baby boomers more narrowly focused on the hipper younger members of generation x those in their late 20 's to mid 30 's taking aim at generation x had its own difficulties some at vh1 felt it was dangerous to put so much emphasis on a younger demographic that considered it a network for older people while risking the alienation of its more mature core many at viacom felt the team spent too much time wringing hands about the target audience and not enough time making television supporters of mr graver said he was not given enough time to make things work none of the four new programs introduced in march including a nighttime talk show late world with zach and a music trivia show called never mind the buzzcocks generated much attention or ratings mr graden now has his work cut out for him to reach what is jokingly referred to as the new vh1 target people with eyeballs he has been here before he found mtv in a similar position when he arrived there in 1997 with mtv riding on the strength of programs like real world but little else it was bleeding ratings and revenues they were in a little bit of a calamity he said in a telephone interview people would say 'if we were just cooler more people would watch there was too much concern about marketing and not enough about programming he added mr graden said he quickly began to apply his formula it does not include any grand vision he says he casts aside focus group research and follows his instincts assigning a team to produce inexpensive experimental pilots freely and keeping an open mind to their ideas like following the family of an aging rock star the osbournes or showing someone stun himself with a taser gun jackass i believe in constantly being open and never thinking you know too much he said sometimes the good ideas are the ones that borrow nothing from the world before them if somebody came in a year ago and pitched ozzy osbourne as the next big thing on paper nobody would have bought that before he started at mtv mr graden was already somewhat of a cable legend as a young executive at the news corporation 's foxlabs experimental programming studio in the mid 1990 's he discovered the hit young animators matt stone and trey parker to keep them in his fold he gave them 2000 to create a video christmas card for him featuring the characters of what is now south park that made the rounds in hollywood eventually to become south park on comedy central of course what appeals to an mtv audience that includes teenage girls and fraternity boys will not necessarily appeal to the more grown up vh1 audience mr graden acknowledges that he is being asked to draw a broader audience than that of mtv but his biggest hits like the osbournes and south park have appealed to people of all ages he said he would seek programs he considered funny or insightful or touching and hope his tastes squared with those of the audience you ca n't be that precious about it he said my job is to find that universal emotional connection he said he believed his instincts would be on the mark at vh1 because just like many in the vh1 audience his tastes are maturing beyond mtv at some point i 'll grow out of it and i 'll just program vh1 he said and after that i 'll go program the aarp channel
