 architecture is a protagonist in the public realm often it is called upon to enact the primal drama of loss and compensation when the loss is great compensation is often visualized in terms of civic grandeur the losses this year were incalculable the attacks on the world trade center were felt across many dimensions of space and time from the neighborhood to the globe from the televised real time moment to history 's multiple points of view the attacks target was modern civilization civilization fought back not just with weapons and slogans but with the capacity to contemplate its highly complex self the attack drove home the importance of discriminating between modern progressive outlooks and oppressive feudal ones discrimination was the big story in architecture this year this matters that does n't this is useful that 's a waste of time this feeds into the future that is stuck in a dead end clarity itself came into sharper focus this is an idea that is a box of orange jell o this is architecture that is etc etc etc such distinctions are not easily made but they are worth the time and effort it takes to form cultivated opinions the need for more penetrating analytic tools became urgent before sept 11 in march a team of real estate developers organized a competition to select the architects to plan an office and residential complex for the so called con ed site a nine acre property on the east river waterfront just south of the united nations headquarters announced with great fanfare as an international search for architects of major talent the competition invited submissions from three winners of the pritzker architecture prize and other noted figures on the world stage it ended with the choice of two local firms of lesser distinction during the selection process richard meier and peter eisenman withdrew after they were asked to play a subordinate role as consulting architects rodolfo machado and jorge silvetti boston architects who had agreed to participate as consultants later resigned as well in the past episodes like this tended to fall beneath a critic 's radar on the premise that all architects are created equal it is often assumed that only fully realized designs should be subject to critical appraisal actually all phases of the building art including zoning economics politics context history aesthetics and ideology fall within the traditional scope of critical interpretation to these factors must be added the inflated and inflationary pressures of professional marketing architects operate in an increasingly competitive market and in an aesthetically eclectic period that is not guided by educated consensus on matters of taste or style the profession benefits from the myth that its members can not be qualitatively ranked the con ed competition illustrated h h richardson 's belief that the first law of american architecture was to get the job the developers did n't want to pay for architecture but richardson never suggested that marketing should be the only law concepts other than social darwinism should make an appearance from time to time architects ca n't buck the market system and should n't try they should use the system as an intellectual as well as an economic framework they should make vivid architecture from the system 's inherent contradictions how can you criticize people for doing what they think is right i was asked that question in one form or another many times this past year my routine answer i read a lot of history in the weeks following the attacks the con ed competition came to seem like a warm up for the full dress performance of an anxious status quo the city 's leading corporate architecture firms linked arms with their developer clients to devise strategies for turning a catastrophe into a business opportunity an ad hoc group the nyc rebuild infrastructure task force convinced its members that they had earned the moral stature of firefighters medical personnel emergency volunteers onlookers were less persuaded the attacks required the entire city to draw on its deepest resources of historical awareness and imaginative reflection but it did not entitle architects to assume that they had been awarded a special franchise to answer the call survivors philosophers firefighters shopkeepers musicians window dressers and dentists have at least as much right to the public 's attention all of us have had to fight feelings of helplessness quite a few projects did deserve the limelight this year in new york they included the american museum of folk art designed by tod williams and billie tsien the prada store in soho by rem koolhaas the neue galerie new york by annabelle selldorf and the melrose community center in the bronx by diana agrest and mario gandelsonas there were also promising designs for future projects by norman foster jean nouvel gwathmey siegel and elizabeth diller and ricardo scofidio preservationists rallied to prevent the disfigurement of eero saarinen 's twa terminal at kennedy airport out of town there were openings of new buildings by mr koolhaas tadao ando santiago calatrava and rafael vinoly i was n't able to cover most of those works the unfolding of events in the politics of new york architecture was a story i could n't overlook this story was not in any case so divorced from the aesthetics of architecture as you might think the political story went far toward explaining why the city 's architecture so seldom registers on the artistic scale from my window at home i have a good view of the secretariat building of the united nations it was completed just half a century ago it was my beacon on the skyline throughout 2001 this was a year in which many including those of us who are not pacifists decided that world peace was n't too corny a topic to think about the architects of the united nations headquarters were among the heroic figures of a great generation like the members of the united nations they were not afraid to face the contradictions of their time particularly those that emerged from conflicts between global and regional perspectives nor were they afraid to be criticized for doing what they believed was right as they understood it generating conflict was essential to the development of discrimination looking back at contemporary commentary on the united nations much of it hostile you will realize that great architecture seldom reinforces preconceived ideas of normalcy it parts company with them and in the process reveals conflicts that have long been lurking underground such revelations provide the fuel that drives public life forward
