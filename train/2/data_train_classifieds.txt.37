 with security at its tightest levels in a year at government installations in the united states and abroad the first anniversary of the hijackings passed without serious incident today but senior administration officials continued to warn of the possibility of an attack on a day when federal authorities girded for the worst when emergency command posts at government agencies were heavily staffed by intelligence and law enforcement officials the day offered more tedium than tension we 're tearing around but it 's just really quiet out there said one senior law enforcement official teams of federal agents some with radiation detection gear scoured a liberian flagged cargo ship that was detained off the port newark elizabeth marine terminal the ship was stopped before it was to dock when traces of radioactivity were detected in its cargo and unexplained sounds possibly from stowaways were heard in the vessel 's cargo areas the ship m v palermo senator was ordered to a security zone six miles out to sea in columbus ohio police evacuated the 41 story james a rhodes state office tower after an employee encountered a man behaving suspiciously on the 28th floor when

searching a van belonging to the man 's employer bomb sniffing dogs reacted on several occasions to substances in the van but the authorities did not find a bomb the suspect oscar sesmas 35 was charged with inducing panic a felony it has been a somewhat busy day across the country said gordon johndroe spokesman for the white house office of homeland security there were daily reports of incidents across the country mr johndroe said but the volume had been slightly higher today while we have no incidents that immediately indicate terrorism there are some people who are being interviewed by authorities to track all information down necessary to conclude the investigations he said mr johndroe said the increased reporting might have been the result of nervousness on the part of citizens and greater numbers of law enforcement officers deployed to protect memorial gatherings air combat patrols which resumed over washington and new york last friday expanded today to include about 10 additional cities military officials said fighter jets were placed on alert at more than a dozen other locations increased police presence was visible in cities around the country missile launchers were positioned around washington and federal and city police were out in force around the monuments in los angeles city police were at full deployment throughout the day in part because of the federal action and in part to monitor the numerous commemorative events taking place citywide evidence of the bush administration 's edgy observance of the sept 11 hijackings was most noticeable abroad nine american embassies remained shut including diplomatic posts in southeast asia it was the possibility of al qaeda attacks in that region that prompted the bush administration on tuesday to ratchet up the threat alert level the level was raised to code orange the second highest risk level in the color coded threat warning system today the precautionary steps spread throughout the world pentagon officials said that commanders in charge of a region that sweeps from east africa to central asia increased its security level to the military 's highest threat level in europe three embassies and four consulates received envelopes in the mail containing an unidentified white powder government officials said none of the diplomatic posts were closed in each case officials removed the powder and envelopes to a secure location and tests were planned to determine whether the powder was anthrax or another lethal substance the official said the identities of the countries that received the envelopes were not disclosed but an embassy official in rome said that one of the mailings had been received there some time this morning late in the morning we got a batch of international mail not diplomatic not military from outside italy there was a letter addressed generically to the embassy which is unusual in itself when the mailroom people picked up the letter they could tell there was some kind of granular stuff inside other countries also reacted to the threat warnings british officials closed their embassies in jakarta and singapore as a precautionary measure an official said australia closed its embassy in east timor the former indonesian province that acquired its independence earlier this year and closed except for emergencies in singapore as western governments continued to investigate the intelligence that led to the concerns about a terrorist attack they are finding parallels to a plot to blow up the american british and australian embassies in singapore last year western officials said today that plot which was thwarted was the work of jemaah islamiyah a militant organization with deep roots in indonesia officials said they have shown a sophistication and level of capability to carry out an attack like this said a western diplomat in singapore speaking about the current threat they have to be taken very seriously australian officials said that jemaah islamiyah which is headed by an indonesian cleric abu bakar bashir was behind the threats that led to the decision to close their embassy in east timor the australian and british embassies in singapore flank the american embassy which remained open today following a brief outdoors memorial ceremony diplomats said the american embassy was better protected higher on a hill and a virtual fortress while the two other embassies were more vulnerable mr johndroe did not say when the threat condition would return to its previous alert level but many local and state officials said they intended to return to normal police staffing levels on thursday gov gary locke of washington said that he had already ordered more state police staffing for the sept 11 ceremonies before the federal government ratcheted up its threat assessment he said he planned to return duty rosters to normal on thursday or friday no one can guarantee there wo n't be an attack in their own community at some point mr locke said but if there is we 're much better prepared to prevent or respond to such an attack than we were before sept 11
