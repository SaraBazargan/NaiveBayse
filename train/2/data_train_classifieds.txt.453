 in the final weeks of last year 's governor 's race and the heady days immediately following his landslide victory at the polls james e mcgreevey made a sweeping promise to new jersey residents that he would not raise taxes less than three months into his term however mr mcgreevey is struggling to close a steep budget deficit and his administration has been steadily trying to prepare the public for an increase in the cigarette tax and changes in the corporate business tax which will bring an additional 700 million to state coffers mr mcgreevey is not scheduled to outline his budget plan until he addresses the state legislature on tuesday but as details of the plan have begun to emerge elected officials from both parties are eagerly awaiting the public reaction to the governor 's likely reversal on taxes even mr mcgreevey 's critics concede that he has been remarkably disciplined in reminding the public that he inherited the deficit from the republicans who controlled trenton for the past decade and in arguing that they should bear much of the responsibility for the painful moves to come he has also tried to create some political wiggle room for himself since taking office by refining his no tax pledge and saying that he was only referring to the sales and income taxes but no elected official in trenton has forgotten that in 1990 gov jim florio 's 28 billion tax increase cost democrats the governor 's mansion and control of both houses of the legislature especially not mr mcgreevey at a press conference in the state house last week the governor was asked whether his shifting position on tax increases was similar to mr florio 's mr mcgreevey used some of his most forceful language to date to describe the problem he now confronts during the course of the campaign i clearly stated it was my objective not to raise taxes he said thumping on the lectern to emphasize his words then upon seeing that literally this represents the largest deficit not only in the history of the state of new jersey this is the largest deficit of any state government in the history of the united states of america this is the all time record breaker one quarter of budget mr mcgreevey based that claim on projections that new jersey will have a deficit equal to 25 percent of its total budget no state has ever had a deficit as high on a percentage basis but republicans who have bristled at the governor 's repeated criticism accuse mr mcgreevey of overstating the problem in order to lower expectations and allow himself to magnify his accomplishments once a balanced budget is finally adopted the governor 's office has projected a 6 billion shortfall last year 's budget was 23 billion there can be no shortfall before a budget has been presented to us said state senator leonard lance a republican from hunterdon i do n't see how you can blame the whitman administration or prior legislatures for a budget that has yet to be written the chief culprit in the state 's budget problems was the economy which brought a sharp drop in tax revenues during the past year mr mcgreevey has already taken steps to close the 3 billion shortfall in the fiscal year ending june 30 by laying off 600 state workers enacting a 5 percent across the board cut and tapping into surpluses in an assortment of special funds now he must propose a budget at a time when income tax receipts are still down and automatic increases in state spending are likely to exceed projected revenues by 5 billion or more the size of that gap in a budget that will likely approach 24 billion has forced mr mcgreevey to consider a handful of steps that he had hoped to avoid he said the state work force would likely be reduced by an early retirement program and more layoffs might be needed eventually despite his relentless complaints that republicans borrowed money irresponsibly during the past decade mr mcgreevey is considering a plan to raise 15 billion by issuing bonds against the state 's proceeds from the tobacco settlement but the most provocative parts of the program are the governor 's two proposals to adjust the state tax code in a reversal from two months ago the governor said this week that he has not ruled out a 50 cent per pack increase in the cigarette tax which would raise 200 million per year he is also likely to adjust the corporate business tax by closing loopholes that allow some major companies to pay as little as 200 per year in state taxes those changes could bring in an additional 500 million in tax revenues the plan now being weighed by the governor does not call for an increase in the corporate tax rate i think people have the reasonable expectation to have fairness and equity mr mcgreevey said noting that the average new jersey family pays more than 200 in state taxes but republicans have already branded the plan a tax increase and warn that it might prolong the economic downturn by forcing companies to leave the state and costing workers their jobs new jersey has learned the hard way that tax hikes cost jobs especially when they 're aimed at our state 's largest employers said senator joseph kyrillos of middletown in fact the last time our businesses faced a significant tax increase over 200000 new jerseyeans lost their jobs recent public opinion polls show that most new jersey residents are not deeply opposed to higher corporate taxes but they already pay some of the highest property tax rates in the country so some political analysts warn that if the governor cuts the property tax rebate program or if his reduction in aid to school districts and local governments leads to property tax increases mr mcgreevey could face political consequences if he does n't raise the sales or income tax i think he can finesse his way through this said david rebovich a political science professor at rider university but there 's a second whammy in this budget crisis how long will school district officials wait to say to their own constituents that they have to raise property taxes because their aid has been frozen by jim mcgreevey
