 for starters imagine driving 1100 miles over a 10 hour stretch you 'll begin at 11 am drive 500 miles at an average speed of 1536 miles an hour for 3 hours 32 minutes with only a few stops of about 14 seconds each at a little past 2 30 pm you 'll climb out and sprint to a waiting helicopter that will take you to an airplane on which you will eat drink absorb an intravenous drip and change clothes you 'll also lose an hour flying east another chopper will carry you to a 5 45 pm start in a different kind of car that you will drive for 600 miles at 1301 mph for 4 hours 21 minutes again with brief breaks in which you will be given water you 'll sweat so much in the more than 100 degrees of the front seat you will not need a bathroom when it 's over if you were me they would pry you out of the car with a clam knife and let someone else drive you to intensive care if you were tony stewart and here you can stop imagining because it happened on sunday you would be bouncing on an adrenaline trampoline babbling about wanting to keep going maybe in a midget or late model car later in the night stewart 's double finishing sixth in the indianapolis 500 and then third in the coca cola 600 was a great athletic feat he not only drove 1100 miles in a day unfortunately there are truckers who do that but he also competitively raced at speeds approaching 200 miles an hour rubbin and bumpin as they say in nascar against cars driven by men unsympathetic to his bravura performance and it was that as one who drove a stock car at speed four days ago full report next sunday i am stunned by stewart 's feat to keep up such a high level of concentration for so long and so successfully seems superhuman not to mention the skill bravery and reflexes to survive much less do well fighting g forces and often hostile rivals the question of whether or not auto racers are really athletes will not even be entertained here and i will not demean them in comparison with blubbery lineman or ha golfers this was the second time stewart pulled the double in 1999 he finished ninth at indy and fourth here but was dehydrated and exhausted at the end this time a physical trainer supervised an exercise and nutrition program stewart started in seventh position at indy in an oldsmobile a race whose internal politics overshadowed his feat it was helio castroneves 's victory which not only marked the return after a six year absence of the eminent roger penske team but it also presaged a possible truce in the civil war between the indy racing league and the championship auto racing teams of which penske is a mainstay stewart a former irl driver said he got greedy at indy and made too many mistakes he stalled in the pits and asked the crew to fix something that was n't broken he called to take downforce off the car which unbalanced it and made it skittish good drivers can feel the car as surely as they feel changes in their own body but their diagnoses are not always perfect at the coca cola 600 which was won by jeff burton stewart 's no 20 home depot pontiac owned by joe gibbs had qualified in 12th but was made to start in the last row of 43 entrants this was nascar 's punishment for missing the mandatory driver 's meeting despite his excellent excuse a mercurial personality stewart said he had been hurt by nascar fans calling him selfish for not saving all his energy for the coca cola 600 and accusing him of putting his fellow drivers at risk there seemed a bit of truth in that when he spun out early in the race apparently misjudging the slickness of the track his finish however more than four hours later was so strong one wondered if he might have won if the race had been twenty miles longer stewart 's biographer the gastonia nc columnist monte dutton says that the driver 's seemingly hot temperament belies a patience and coolness in the car dutton describes stewart as the flip side of jeff gordon whose inoffensive charm masks a very ruthless even risky driving style stewart who turned 30 this month and gordon who will be 30 in august are two of the most attractive young stars in nascar although gordon a three time champion is far more bankable beyond the track gordon is cute and pleasant a prom king while stewart 's softer sulkier retro good looks give credence to the title of dutton 's book rebel with a cause brassey 's but the rebel is doing just fine the indy finish was worth 218850 the lowe 's motor speedway run 132300 a good day 's pay
