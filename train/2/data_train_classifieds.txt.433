 after bearing the multibillion dollar cost of the war in afghanistan the bush administration is now questioning how much it will contribute to the united nations reconstruction effort in that country officials said the administration was considering paying less than the united states has customarily contributed to postwar reconstruction costs in other countries but members of congress and the state department are arguing to keep the american contribution as generous as possible since the end of the cold war the united states has underwritten large portions of peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts in the balkans cambodia mozambique and many other countries but the cost of fighting the war in afghanistan has already cost tens of billions of dollars we will look at afghanistan in its entirety the fact that we 've made a uniquely large contribution so far and we will contribute appropriately a senior white house official said he added we do have a role to play we do not want to be the people who do the bombing and leave the reconstruction to others the price by world bank estimates could be more than 10 billion for the first five years alone to rebuild schools and roads and communications systems create a health system attack the narcotics problem and underwrite the new government especially the police and justice system to ensure the rule of law typically the united states contributes one fourth of a peacekeeping mission 's costs and has contributed up to one third of reconstruction costs senior european and united nations officials said they had assumed that the united states would pay up to one third of the reconstruction costs with europe paying one third and the rest of the world led by japan picking up the final third it has been an unwritten assumption that this would happen but we would not complain if the united states maybe gave less said a european official as officials prepare for a top level meeting later this week in brussels to discuss reconstruction efforts in afghanistan the federal agency for international development is drawing up the american plans that will be considered there as a candidate and then as president mr bush has showed little enthusiasm for rebuilding other nations an ideological bent that officials say plays into the debate within the administration over the american role in postwar afghanistan for the president the top priority of reconstruction is to ensure that afghanistan never again becomes a terrorist haven officials drawing up the american plans say that means immediate assistance to demobilized soldiers helping them return to the countryside as farmers and animal herders instead of reverting to lawlessness that would undermine the nascent afghan interim government we 've already started planning to ship seed for the next spring planting and live animals to restore the loss of huge portions of the sheep and goat herds said andrew s natsios administrator for the agency for international development after 20 years of war the country is so threadbare that the united nations put together an emergency 20 million fund to underwrite the interim government providing desks computers telephones and salaries this is all part of a broader political message that however long it takes we are committed to a stable democratic government said mark malloch brown of the united nations development program who will oversee the reconstruction the arab and muslim worlds including many countries that are part of the coalition are watching to see if the united states holds to its promise that it is fighting terrorism in afghanistan and not fighting the afghan people and like a mantra administration officials have said they have learned from the soviets war in afghanistan and will not abandon the country this time to prove that point administration officials point to the president 's contribution of an additional 320 million in food and other relief aid to afghanistan during the war and to the united states record as the largest foreign donor to afghanistan even before sept 11 and at this stage of the conflict the president plans to stay the course even though he has yet to decide how much money the united states will contribute said his spokesman ari fleischer given how involved the united states has been in feeding the afghan people the president believes it is the right thing for the united states to remain politically engaged and to help with the reconstruction of afghanistan mr fleischer said today yet even as relief operations are spreading across afghanistan and reconstruction plans begin the administration continues to make the war effort its top priority the pentagon insists that gen tommy franks at central command has the ultimate say over coordinating civilian and military operations on the ground this is going to be an overlapping effort said joseph j collins the deputy assistant secretary of defense for peacekeeping and relief assistance our first priority is to insure noninterference in the war
