 this is how richard fitzgerald a private chauffeur who lives in greenwich village described his feelings about some of the mayoral candidates in late august three weeks before the scheduled primary i like mark green the best he is sort of a voice for the people and on michael r bloomberg the republican candidate i think he 's paying his place on the ticket i do n't think he 's earned a place in politics this is what richard fitzgerald says now three weeks after the attack on the world trade center i think bloomberg may be tougher on terrorists right now being that he is a real businessman i think he is the one to protect and rebuild this city i 've become selfish i know but i do n't want to die in this city because of a crazy terrorist and so it goes a week before a democratic runoff that will pit mr green against fernando ferrer the bronx borough president there is much soul searching and hand wringing in greenwich village soho tribeca chelsea and battery park city overwhelmingly white mostly middle class neighborhoods that make up the 66th assembly district it is not the first time that voters in this district a democratic stronghold are reacting to political events in unexpected ways in 1997 more than half voted for mayor rudolph w giuliani even though four years earlier the majority of them had flatly rejected him now with thousands of bodies entombed in the rubble of the world trade center a few blocks from their homes voters in this district may be gearing up to help rearrange the city 's political map once again some voters who used to despise mr giuliani who has said he would like to extend his term by three months now love him for his command of the city after the collapse of the twin towers some who voted for mr green in the primary are ditching him for mr ferrer because they like how mr ferrer stood up to mr giuliani 's pressures to prolong his mandate and still others like mr fitzgerald who had rarely ever voted republican are inclined to vote for mr bloomberg because they say he is the only one with the business experience to resurrect lower manhattan from the ashes i have been exposed to bloomberg because my boss is very big in the city said mr fitzgerald who declined to identify his boss other than to say he is a billionaire who often has private chats with the city 's movers and shakers from the back of his car i meet and drive a lot of powerful men and they talk you always pretend not to hear not to pay attention but you ca n't help it and what mr fitzgerald has heard he said has made him think mr bloomberg should be mayor we need to focus on rebuilding the city not on helping the poor people mr fitzgerald said the bombing completely changed everything but i ca n't say what i 'll do for sure until i get into the booth again louis k meisel a soho art dealer and historian knows just what he will do once inside the voting booth he has made up his mind to vote for mr bloomberg even though in the primary he voted for mr green the priority now is rebuilding and putting the city back together he said we need a republican and a businessman to run the city someone who wo n't bow down to the demands of every single ethnic and political group complaining that they are being excluded mr meisel who has lived in new york for all but 8 of his 59 years says he is a registered democrat who voted twice for mr giuliani but now wants to see him go when i heard he wanted to stay i thought about it for a while he said but you know what his time 's up it 's the rule of the people and term limits should stand there are other people who are capable of running the city of new york few neighborhoods benefited more from the quality of life improvements during the eight years of the giuliani administration than those in the 66th assembly district home to dozens of art galleries trendy restaurants popular parks and quaint shops the area thrived during the giuliani years when shoppers and tourists felt it was safe to be out at night marianne salerno a 60 year old medical assistant who has lived in the west village for 50 years remembers the time when sitting on a bench in washington square park was considered risky now children play in the park 's playground while their parents read magazines glancing up only occasionally to check on them and it is all because of giuliani said ms salerno i do n't say so because i 'm italian that has nothing to do with it it 's because he is a great mayor the day of the primary ms salerno a republican who often votes for democrats wrote mr giuliani 's name on the ballot even though she favored mr green but now she will vote for mr green ms salerno says she is opposed to mr ferrer because he has the support of the rev al sharpton whom she dislikes she also disapproves of mr ferrer 's refusal to allow mr giuliani a chance to stay on as mayor for three more months how can ferrer not give giuliani three months she said he deserves at least three more months if i were in charge i would change the constitution and have him stay forever ruth a peltason 45 a book editor who lives on barrow street in the village said that she too could not understand why mr ferrer turned down mr giuliani 's request and she said she was shocked when mr ferrer attempted to use his experiences in rebuilding the bronx to try to persuade voters that he was the best candidate to rebuild lower manhattan when i heard him say that i thought 'buddy you are wrong she said this is so big you ca n't possibly compare the two she decided to vote for mr green in the runoff then when former mayor edward i koch endorsed mr ferrer on tuesday ms peltason thought again about her choices koch 's decision did give me pause she said i was very pro koch but you know what this is bigger than koch too in the end though it was mr green 's agreeing to share power with mr giuliani for a few months that convinced her she had picked the right candidate oprah winfrey called him the mayor of the united states she said speaking of mr giuliani for ferrer to say in essence 'i do n't need the guy was not politically smart you never kick out a favorite that 's precisely what cemented paul monahan 's favorable opinion of mr ferrer mr monahan a 41 year old independent contractor who has lived in the west village for 12 years said he voted for mr ferrer in the primary for no specific reason it was more of a gut feeling he said i do n't like mark green he said there is just something about him i do n't know what it is because i know he is a dedicated public servant mr monahan became convinced that he had made the right choice after mr ferrer turned mr giuliani down i think at first i did n't like ferrer 's saying no to giuliani he said it seemed so cold and blunt but he was the only one who saw through the whole thing and had it right from the beginning see the terrorists win the more we change he explained so we should n't change we are bigger than that we are supposed to get a new mayor so let 's go elect a new mayor
