 officially of course it will always be the b train but just take it on any given sunday evening along about half of its southerly course and you might agree that it would not be much of an exaggeration to give the subway line a subtitle the fish train whoa man it smells like fish in here said ramon vasquez a hotel maintenance worker on sunday mr vasquez was on his way home to brooklyn aboard a sparsely populated b train when a bracing aroma boarded at the grand street station in chinatown it got on along with about 20 chinese american brooklynites each carrying two armfuls of diaphanous bright orange plastic bags bulging with all manner of food sweet potato leaves flowering chives slender purple eggplant brown litchi but first and foremost with fish why asked jin hua chung a steam press operator who moved to bensonhurst from chinatown five years ago but still buys fish only on mott street because i like fresh that 's why and only chinatown gives me fresh said mr chung 60 from one of whose orange plastic bags poked the head of a good size tilapia which had been yanked live from a fish market tank only a couple of minutes before he and his wife share kitchen duties but i am the better cook he says the sunday subway fish migration has been growing for a long time now as chinese immigrants have fanned out in greater numbers from manhattan to brooklyn neighborhoods and yet seem to return en masse to manhattan on weekends to do all their food shopping it can be seen to some degree on a number of trains that serve other chinatowns the n and r to brooklyn the 6 train from canal street to grand central where the fish make their transfer to the 7 and back to flushing but the migration is at its most concentrated and pungent aboard the b train which provides the fastest way to get from chinatown to sunset park the largest chinese american enclave in brooklyn and on a nice late spring sunday it can seem as if thousands of pounds of fish are making their way to brooklyn along the b bag by plastic bag tucked beneath the feet of thousands of riders bound for thousands of steamers and soup pots among the exporters on sunday was a 35 year old man named wu just wu please waiting by the turnstiles for his wife who does all the fish shopping for their family he is in charge of the vegetables there was ying hsu a law student and her boyfriend dan goldschmidt a lawyer who had found what they needed and were bound for brooklyn i just got salmon reported ms hsu almost sheepishly a very generic american fish there was lisa mui an unemployed bartender from sheepshead bay who had accompanied her mother on a grocery run i love the scene said ms mui who had elaborate fingernails and a pierced tongue i do love the scene but to be honest it 's really all about the food later asked whether the chicken they bought in chinatown tasted better than supermarket chicken she rolled her eyes and glanced at her mother and said as long as it does n't talk to me when i eat it it 's fine by me the contest for most popular whole fish sunday seemed to be a dead heat between striped bass and tilapia a type of african lake fish that is now widely farmed around the world and has become a staple in many chinese homes tilapia is also said to have been the fish that jesus multiplied along with the loaves to feed the multitudes the contest for most widely used color of plastic shopping bag was not even close deep jack o' lantern orange which has become a kind of calling card of chinatown groceries and fishmongers bright red ran a distant second and pink third orange is a lucky color that 's why said kenny tran a manager at the tan my my market on the corner of chrystie street and grand close enough to the subway entrance to hit with a scallop black looks horrible and white you know why people do n't use white because white is always for the dead while sunday 's fish migration seemed festive enough one man was seen lugging home a case of budweiser along with his catch there was a lot of noticeable mourning going on too because by the end of the summer the fish train will be no more at least for a while repairs to the manhattan bridge will mean that the b will not run to grand street and the station will be nearly shut down for more than two years the fish will still make their way to brooklyn of course but probably in smaller schools on different trains it might even be difficult to smell which ones and mr chung is not happy they say this is a developed country he said if they knew this bridge was going to have so many problems why could n't they have built another one
