 after a day of speeches denouncing gun violence and praising the constitutional right to bear arms the house of representatives easily passed a bill today limiting lawsuits against the firearms industry the measure now goes to the senate where it already has enough sponsors to win a majority vote but neither side is sure it has the 60 votes to prevail against a filibuster promised by democrats the bill would take away one of the chief weapons used by advocates of gun control who have joined with cities and victims of guns in filing more than two dozen lawsuits seeking damages from the industry for making unsafe guns and allowing guns to fall into criminals hands it makes gun manufacturers and dealers immune to lawsuits seeking damages resulting from the misuse of their products by others the bill was passed 285 to 140 with 63 democrats joining the republican majority it already has 52 sponsors in the senate including 9 democrats but it has determined foes we 'll do everything we can to fight it including a filibuster said senator dianne feinstein democrat of california representative f james sensenbrenner jr republican of wisconsin and chairman of the judiciary committee said we should n't use the judicial process to bankrupt an industry that produces a legal weapon a legal product although the legislation would still allow lawsuits against gun makers and dealers who knowingly and willfully violate the law critics said most victims of guns would be shut out of court shielding gun makers dealers and distributors from liability and dismissing all pending lawsuits is the most egregious form of corporate welfare i 've yet to see said representative rahm emanuel democrat of illinois this is special treatment for special interests while representatives from urban districts rose to tell stories of individuals hurt by guns those from rural districts expounded on the constitutional right to bear arms the republican majority was joined by democrats like representative artur davis of alabama who was elected last year after criticizing his opponent for siding with the national rifle association too often i 'm in favor of trigger locks and disagree with the nra on some issues mr davis said but i happen to think that the nra has a point on the issue of lawsuits if you 're hit by someone driving a car at 90 miles an hour i do n't think you should sue general motors for making a car that someone else uses to break the law since the bill was sponsored by a majority of house members its passage was ensured and the majority easily defeated amendments offered by democrats the chief drama of the day turned out to be a dispute over a remark by representative barbara cubin republican of wyoming while she was discussing a proposed amendment allowing a lawsuit against a dealer who sells a gun to someone who uses or is addicted to illegal drugs gun makers and dealers have long argued that they can not be expected to recognize on sight which customers are dangerous and that trying to do so would expose them to other kinds of lawsuits for illegally discriminating against people based on how they look or where they live ms cubin began to make that argument by mentioning her two adult sons they 're blond haired and they 're blue eyed she said one amendment said we could n't sell drugs to anybody that was on drugs or had had drug treatment or something like that well so does that mean if you go into a black community you ca n't sell any gun to any black person or does that mean if my sons because they look like whereupon she was interrupted by representative melvin watt democrat of north carolina mr watt who is black asked that she be punished for inappropriate language but his proposal was defeated largely on party lines ms cubin later apologized on the floor for her remark the republicans refusal to discipline her was criticized by representative robert t matsui democrat of california who called her words racist
