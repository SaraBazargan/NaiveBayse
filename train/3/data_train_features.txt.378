 there is something of a mystery to israel 's new campaign to kill members and leaders of hamas a mystery that goes to the heart of the standoff with the palestinians why did n't israel do this a year ago or two years ago and if it was a bad idea then why is it a good idea now no one has very good answers the change in strategy exposes the profound shifts in the diplomatic and military terrain here over three years of conflict and the poverty of solutions for bringing it to an end for years israel has carried out targeted killings assassinations palestinians call them of militants from hamas the palestinians leading islamic militant group and other violent organizations but it largely left alone the groups political leaders as opposed to military leaders who prepare attacks israel isolated the top palestinian political leader yasir arafat last year trapping him in his ruined ramallah compound and threatening to deport him it claimed that his declared support of a two state solution and mealy condemnations of suicide bombings were cover for fomenting terrorism meanwhile it left untouched hamas leaders who openly advocated the destruction of israel and celebrated suicide bombings that has now changed in june israel wounded a top political leader of hamas abdel aziz rantisi with a missile strike in gaza then after a devastating hamas suicide bombing here on aug 19 it killed ismail abu shanab a political figure known as the leading hamas advocate of a temporary halt to attacks on israelis since then israel has killed five other hamas members israeli officials compare the new campaign to israel 's pursuit of all the palestinians involved in killing 11 israeli athletes at the 1972 munich olympics but why had israel not acted sooner against the hamas political leadership a top israeli security official said israel may simply have made a mistake further he said we were concerned that the reaction might be undesirable that the targeted killings could heighten hamas suicide attacks but he said israel was left with no other choice because the governing palestinian authority was doing nothing asked why israel had not taken this step against hamas sooner professor ariel merari of tel aviv university one of israel 's most eminent counterterrorist experts said i do n't have any answer but he said he had his doubts that the new policy would be effective in stopping terrorism he said there was no evidence that the campaign to kill those involved in the munich attack had any deterrent effect hamas he said was a popular movement primarily influenced by palestinian public opinion that 's the key to winning the struggle changing palestinian public opinion he said and i doubt that killing hamas leaders is a useful means toward that end for the first 18 months or so of the conflict israel 's approach to fighting hamas besides stopping terrorists in the act was to put pressure on the palestinian authority blocking financing and destroying offices while demanding that it confront terrorism but mr arafat the authority 's president never ordered decisive action and the authority began to collapse some of its officials said privately that they wished israel would act against the hamas leaders who they saw as their own direst political threat as the suicide bombings continued israel said more than a year ago that it had no choice but to seize back cities and towns that had been ceded to palestinian authority control under the oslo peace process accusing the authority of direct links to terrorism israel over the last year forbade palestinian security forces to operate in most of the region it said it was assuming full responsibility again for its own security conducting raids in the west bank and gaza prime minister ariel sharon said he was prepared to make painful concessions for peace including a palestinian state but that he had no palestinian partner willing to confront terror watching the israeli strategy unfold many palestinians concluded that israel 's true goal was to destroy not hamas but the palestinian authority they said mr sharon liked the image conferred on palestinian nationalism by hamas 's venomous political leaders at the same time they argued mr sharon regarded not hamas but the palestinian authority as the real strategic threat since unlike hamas it held out the realistic possibility of a palestinian state alongside israel the two state concept that hamas has never accepted from the start hamas cleverly took advantage of the israeli military campaign said imad falouji a palestinian official who is a former member of the group and retains close ties to it hamas he said in a recent conversation in gaza city did not want to risk its popularity by being seen as provoking civil conflict with a direct attack on the palestinian authority instead it had a strategy mr falouji calls the circle hamas would attack israel israel would attack the authority and the authority would have to suffer the attacks or comply with israeli demands and attack hamas making palestinians see it as the party engaging in civil conflict but no one can speak of hamas attacks on the pa mr falouji said hamas knows the circle only goes one way this circle was interrupted by the american backed peace plan the road map once israel accepted it and mr arafat 's mainstream fatah movement decided on a unilateral cease fire hamas had little choice but to play along palestinian analysts say otherwise hamas would have risked its popularity because palestinians might have seen it as the sole source of continuing violence and the obstacle to peace as the peace talks flagged hamas began testing its freedom to attack again saying it would conduct reprisals for israeli raids that killed militants the horrific suicide bombing in jerusalem on aug 19 in which six children died and many were wounded scrambled all strategic calculations palestinian authority officials said that they then acquired the political leverage to act against hamas but that israel undermined them by killing mr abu shanab less than two days later israeli officials said they had held back for those two days in hopes the palestinian authority would act but despaired yet there were not many dramatic reprisals left for israel it already controlled most of the west bank and the palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas and security minister muhammad dahlan had the bush administration 's support as alternatives to mr arafat that left and still leaves the hamas political leaders as a target to bolster israel 's deterrent threat and assure israelis that their government is acting it may be that hamas now will rethink its violent strategy or that the palestinian authority will at last risk acting against it and it may be that the violence will intensify professor merari said he initially expected the conflict to last only a few months but now can not guess when it will end it 's really sad he said but i think we 'll have to see more violence until both sides are ready
