 locked in conflict fearing for their very existence as nations israelis and palestinians have for generations prized national unity deferring or papering over internal disputes about the means and ends of their struggles but before even hoping to end the conflict with each other each side must first face up to these conflicts within itself according to the iron logic of a new international peace plan today president bush secured commitments from ariel sharon the israeli prime minister and mahmoud abbas the palestinian prime minister to begin doing just that mr sharon promised to begin confronting the settler movement he nurtured for decades that means plunging into a long postponed national debate which mr sharon has tentatively begun over what israel wants from its occupation of the west bank and gaza strip which it captured in the 1967 war and where it has now settled 200000 of its citizens mr abbas promised to end the armed palestinian uprising and to permit only law enforcement officers to carry guns that means stopping the terrorists who have hijacked the palestinian national dream and shifting the internal palestinian conversation away from empathy for suicide bombers to horror at the killing to make peace in the middle east israelis and palestinians may have to come to the brink of what they fear could be civil conflict if they are sincere about seeing this process through each of the leaders here including president bush will have to take severe political tests and all of them will have to pass tonight in jerusalem thousands of settlers gathered to angrily protest today 's summit accusing their old ally mr sharon of surrendering to terrorism in the gaza strip leaders of hamas rejected mr abbas 's suggestion that they surrender their arms it seemed fitting that these men took this leadership challenge upon themselves in aqaba which translates as obstacle they met down the beach from the ruins of a fort captured in 1917 by lawrence of arabia during a previous attempt to reshape the middle east on each side of this triangular summit doubts weighed heavily about the depth of the others commitments palestinian officials fear that mr sharon 's talk of dismantling unauthorized outposts of settlements was meant merely to create political theater to generate an appearance of israeli sacrifice for peace without much cost to the settlement movement in recent years settlers have set up dozens of these makeshift outposts of trailers and tents on hilltops across the west bank sometimes populating them with only a handful of people if anyone yet evacuating any outpost is almost sure to generate searing images of settlers screaming at soldiers and perhaps even fighting with them as they have in the past then after a time the outposts can easily be set up again as they have been as an obstacle to a geographically contiguous palestinian state in the west bank these outposts pale beside giant settlements like ariel and ma'ale adumim with some 20000 residents or more or beside smaller but deeply rooted settlements like itamar near nablus those settlements are untouched so far by the peace plan the settlements are perfectly legitimate alan baker the legal adviser to the foreign ministry said drawing a distinction between them and the relatively few outposts that israel considers illegal during the 10 years of the oslo agreement which unlike this plan did not explicitly address settlements the population of the settlements doubled the new plan though calls for a freeze on settlement growth which mr sharon did not address today it was perhaps significant that mr sharon spoke in english not in hebrew israeli leaders have often accused palestinian leaders particularly yasir arafat of speaking in english and not arabic when they delivered messages that were popular with the americans but not necessarily with their own people yet at 75 mr sharon an architect of the settlement movement as a means of promoting israel 's security has unique credentials to question whether settlements now safeguard or endanger israel 's existence by perpetuating the occupation it is in israel 's interest not to govern the palestinians he said today a peaceful palestinian democracy he continued will promote the long term security and well being of israel as a jewish state like mr sharon mr abbas who spoke in arabic was careful to couch his endorsement of the peace plan not just in idealistic terms but in hard nosed language about his people 's national interests in renouncing terror against the israelis wherever they may be he said that such methods clashed with palestinians religious and moral traditions these methods also conflict with the kind of state we wish to build based on human rights and rule of law he said yet mr abbas 's remarks were not without a note of ambiguity even as he ruled out violence to deal with occupation he said that palestinians would be partners in the international war against occupation and terrorism according to the white house translation of his remarks after more than a month mr abbas 's oratory about stopping violence has yet to be put to the test mr abbas has been trying to negotiate a cease fire with hamas islamic jihad and other violent groups rather than to arrest those intent on violence and to confiscate arms mr abbas told mr bush today that it would take him a couple of more weeks to persuade hamas to agree to stop the violence palestinian officials said nabil shaath the palestinian foreign minister said that mr abbas could work only through persuasion because israeli raids had left him without police forces yet muhammad dahlan mr abbas 's security minister has thousands of armed men under this control mr abbas does not have nearly mr sharon 's domestic political strength but he has credibility as a warhorse of the mainstream fatah movement and as a palestinian refugee of the 1948 arab israeli war perhaps most important he has gained international legitimacy palestinian officials said tonight that they had achieved their chief goals for the summit reviving a relationship with the united states that has been all but dead for more than a year and gaining what they saw as a clear american commitment to the peace plan diplomats who know him say mr abbas understands he will lose this critical asset international credibility and support if he fails to act against terrorists indeed the risks to national unity may have been apparent today but so were the risks of not risking unity as demonstrated by the man who was not there mr arafat mr arafat led his people from behind never completely alienating any group or excluding any option including terrorism he wanted national unity said one diplomat who has studied him closely but you ca n't have national unity while you have people getting blown up in coffee shops
