 on monday night the new york philharmonic made one of its infrequent visits to the place it used to call home carnegie hall the orchestra had not played there in two years many people within the organization must rue the day that the orchestra was tempted with the prospect of having its own spanking new concert hall in lincoln center philharmonic hall as it was initially called did not turn out well after several major renovations and a name change yet another reconstruction project is being planned to make avery fisher hall an acoustically rewarding place so it must be a joy for the philharmonic musicians to perform at carnegie with its splendid sound for the occasion kurt masur picked two works that promised to show him and his orchestra at their best shostakovich 's first and bruckner 's fourth symphonies under these circumstances it was puzzling that the performances especially that of the bruckner were somewhat unsettled mr masur responds intuitively to the serenity and spaciousness of bruckner 's music with other german romantic composers brahms especially there can be an overly emphatic quality to his interpretations but calm authority pervades his performances of bruckner as in the magisterial account of the fourth symphony he conducted in may at avery fisher hall the problem on monday could have been that the orchestra had not completely adjusted to carnegie hall 's resonant acoustics at fisher hall the players must work hard for clarity and detail at carnegie hall extra effort can backfire too often volleys of brass hunting calls and bass ostinatos leapt out from the overall texture in an unruly way the first horn is almost like a concerto soloist in the first movement of this work and philip myers played with considerable expressivity yet he sounded tentative as if afraid of sticking out too much in this reverberant space mr masur had some trouble maintaining steady tempos in the long expanses of the first movement still mr masur has such an affinity for this work and the players know it so well that there were many rewarding qualities to their account the wistful andante movement had a lovely schubertian lilt the scherzo was crisp and punchy if at times a little careless and mr masur managed to bring cohesion to the finale which even ardent brucknerians concede is structurally rambling the orchestra sounded confident in the shostakovich an audacious sassy brilliant work completed before the composer had turned 20 the performance bristled with vitality ms masur conveyed the brash humor of the music as in the sloshing tipsy waltz episode of the first movement without ever letting it turn sarcastic
