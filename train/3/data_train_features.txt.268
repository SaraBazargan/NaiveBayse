 the issue of discrimination in jury selection returned to the supreme court today 16 years after the justices specified procedures for detecting the unconstitutional practice of picking or excluding jurors on the basis of race that landmark 1986 ruling batson v kentucky has been working imperfectly defense lawyers say because the court has not yet made clear how trial judges are to evaluate a prosecutor 's assertion that the removal of a substantial number of black prospective jurors was unrelated to race seth p waxman arguing on behalf of a texas death row inmate thomas miller el told the justices today that it was surpassingly important for the court to use this case to demonstrate how the batson decision 's abstract rules were supposed to work in practice mr waxman urged the justices to rule that it was objectively unreasonable for the judge at mr miller el 's 1986 trial to accept the prosecutor 's explanation that the removal of 10 of 11 black prospective jurors was based on a valid perception that they would hesitate to impose the death penalty and not on their race mr miller el who is black was convicted of killing a hotel clerk during a 1985 robbery at a holiday inn near the dallas fort worth airport the dallas county prosecutor 's office at the time had a long history of excluding black jurors under a policy that some years earlier had been incorporated into an official training manual around the time of mr miller el 's trial the dallas morning news published the results of a study of 100 randomly selected felony trials under the headline race bias pervades jury selection prosecutors routinely bar blacks study finds but the defense failed to persuade the trial judge to evaluate the prosecutor 's jury selection methods in light of that larger context mr miller el 's conviction was upheld by the texas state courts and the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit in new orleans ruled last year that his petition for a writ of habeas corpus did not even qualify for a hearing he was within a week of a scheduled execution last feb 15 when the supreme court granted a stay and agreed to hear his case miller el v cockrell no 01 7662 the court then appointed mr waxman a former solicitor general who is now in private practice to represent mr miller el the texas defender service also represents him in the argument today gena a bunn chief of the texas attorney general 's capital litigation division told the court that the lower courts findings of an absence of purposeful discrimination in the jury selection were fully supported by the record and are entitled to deference ms bunn conceded that the prosecutor asked more probing questions of most black potential jurors than of most whites read from different scripts in mr waxman 's words but said the different treatment was based not on race but on answers the potential jurors gave on their juror questionnaires and during initial questioning ms bunn 's assertion that evidence of the prosecution 's use of race in other jury selections while not completely irrelevant was little better than circumstantial met with objections from several justices why is n't this very significant evidence to which we must give great weight justice anthony m kennedy asked adding the best evidence is often circumstantial ms bunn replied the only question is why the prosecution struck these jurors in this case justice ruth bader ginsburg said that there can never be a successful batson challenge with such a narrow field of inquiry the prosecution could always give a neutral reason justice ginsburg said the question troubling me is what in the end did the court consider her reference was to the so called stage 3 in an inquiry under batson v kentucky in the first stage one side typically the defense demonstrates facts that unless there is an explanation to the contrary indicate a likelihood that race has been used in the jury selection at the second stage the other side puts forward the race neutral reasons for its actions at the final third stage the judge weighs the evidence and decides whether to accept the explanation though the argument today concerned a death penalty case the same formula applies to all cases in which a question is raised about jury selection in a second argument today the court examined the consequences of a decision by congress 10 years ago to bar the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms from reinstating gun ownership rights to felons under federal law a felony convictions brings with it a firearms disability making it illegal to own or carry a gun the law gave the secretary of the treasury the authority to waive the disability if warranted by the person 's record or the circumstances of the crime the secretary in turn delegated that authority to the bureau a unit of the treasury department ten years ago after a study by the violence policy center a gun control group showed that the bureau was restoring gun privileges to many felons who went on to commit new crimes congress passed an appropriations measure to bar the bureau from spending its money to process any applications for waivers the measure has been renewed annually two years ago a federal judge in beaumont tex acting on his own restored the gun privileges of thomas lamar bean a licensed firearms dealer who was convicted by mexico of transporting 200 rounds of ammunition across the boarder mr bean had been attending a gun show in laredo tex and neglected to remove the ammunition from his car the fifth circuit upheld the judge 's action in the government 's appeal united states v bean no 01 704 deputy solicitor general edwin s kneedler argued that the judge joe fisher had no jurisdiction judges can set aside the actions by federal agencies only if the action was arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law mr kneedler said but the refusal to process mr bean 's application he continued was not contrary to law it was compelled by law from their questions and comments most justices appeared to agree with the government 's position arguing for mr bean thomas c goldstein said congress barred only the bureau and not the treasury secretary himself from acting on applications the secretary 's refusal to process the application was the same as denying it and was thus appropriately subject to judicial review mr goldstein said
