 ariel meyerowitz 580 broadway at prince street soho through jan 27 dr harold edgerton 's stop action photographs including the famous milk drop coronet remain enduring icons of modern experience yet why the world of art embraced edgerton 's originally purely scientific work is still a question worth pondering superficially this exhibition 's mostly small black and white vintage prints from 1935 to 1979 are simply informative records of events that happen too quickly for the naked eye to register you can see how all the muscles and tendons of a boxer 's arm stand out at the moment his fist hits the stationary bag you can study hummingbirds an owl or a bat arrested in mid flight as well as a popping balloon that has a wide open gash yet remains tautly inflated pictures that cumulatively record motion preserve the graceful trajectory of an athlete 's golf or squash swing or a pole vaulter 's leap from the perspective of art the appeal of edgerton 's images is in their perfectly composed lucidity and their surrealistic fusion of the factual and the miraculous the milk drop coronet the image of a glowing white crownlike form on a red field seen here in one of just two existing 1957 c prints made from the original negative is an uncannily beautiful image like the motion studies of eadweard muybridge in which the gridded repetition of the human figure suggests a metaphor about the subjection of humanity to technology edgerton 's images have acquired an emblematic aspect they have become symbols of a world in which the real is determined more and more by what machines rather than humans can perceive ken johnson
