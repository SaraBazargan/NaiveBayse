 many people dream about opening their own restaurant in the most common rendition of this fantasy the restaurant is a small place more like a living room with just a few special things on the menu that change according to whim dinner is like a night with friends after a few escapist minutes this fantasy usually passes but not always as in the case of a a tiny place where the kitchen table as restaurant comes to life actually a is more of a lounge than a restaurant with several mismatched formica topped kitchen tables and room for 15 or so any more and the chef marc solomon who owns a with his fiancee blue grant would n't be able to enjoy the fantasy though the menu offers only six dishes at a time mr solomon barely keeps up from his station behind a counter with only a toaster oven and two single burners nonetheless he and ms grant have turned a into an extension of their home greeting everyone who comes through the door a surprising number of whom know mr solomon from past incarnations downtown where he ran a restaurant les deux lapins and a bar red strype a sweet 60 's vibe pervades the premises and when it 's time to leave hugs and kisses abound even if you 're a newcomer as mr solomon says when you 've got only 200 square feet you 've got to love everybody they 've wisely disencumbered themselves of distractions a place to wait there 's a bench outside a wine list bring your own the host appreciates a taste just be sure it 's something you wo n't mind sipping from a drinking glass that leaves mr solomon 's tiny menu the sort of inspired amateur cooking that would make him the best loved member of a college commune 's kitchen broiled snails 8 a half dozen or more are stuffed inside two big conch shells in a bath of oil herbs and plenty of garlic they make a perfect appetizer for a main course of curried lamb pie 10 a delicious caribbean inspired dish of ground lamb in a crisp pastry shell moistened with a thin layer of coconut creme fraiche and crowned with tossed greens those are by far the two best dishes a notch below are a rustic chunky rabbit pate 9 served with figs olives and cornichons and an equally nice hors d'oeuvre a roasted pear stuffed with goat cheese 9 trailing the pack are a vegetarian crepe 10 stuffed with ackee a bland caribbean fruit and calaloo a spinachlike leaf which is too dry despite a mango salsa warmed camembert 8 topped with grapes and grape tomatoes is a runny failure to me but seems nonetheless popular judging by how the room is continually perfumed by melting cheese there are two desserts 6 each that are quite good made by a friend of mr solomon 's one is a dense chocolate and coffee cheesecake that actually tastes like fine espresso while the other is a subtle peach and mango cake you might wonder why mr solomon and ms grant call their restaurant a the restaurant takes its logo from the a train and the dining room is decorated with subway maps which may seem curious since the a stops nowhere nearby maybe in their fantasy all trains lead to a a 947 columbus avenue near 106th street manhattan 212 531 1643 best dishes broiled snails in garlic sauce curried lamb pie rabbit pate roasted pear with goat cheese chocolate coffee cheesecake peach mango cake price range savory dishes 8 to 10 desserts 6 credit cards cash only hours lunch thursday and friday 11 30 am to 4 pm dinner tuesday through saturday 6 to 10 pm brunch saturday and sunday noon to 5 pm wheelchair access tightly packed tables narrow entrance to restroom
