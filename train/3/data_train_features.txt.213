 two gas explosions nearly half a mile beneath the earth killed four coal miners on sunday afternoon and left nine of their rescuers missing and presumed dead in what could be the nation 's worst mining calamity in 17 years many of those missing and unreachable in the still burning mine were colleagues of six men injured in a cave in the initial explosion at the blue creek no 5 mine the nation 's deepest about 40 miles southwest of birmingham instead of fleeing 10 miners working nearby raced to aid their comrades and were caught in a second explosion about 45 minutes later officials of the mine company jim walter resources inc said these great acts of unselfishness are eerily reminiscent of the heroes of our sept 11 national tragedy don defosset chief executive of walter industries the company 's parent said today at a news conference these men gave their lives to help others just as the firefighters and police of new york did nearly two weeks ago these men are heroes the blue creek mines which encompass a vast area between birmingham and tuscaloosa are considered ultra gassy by the federal government because of the large amounts of methane released during the mining process the mines are equipped with several air intake shafts 23 feet in diameter to bring oxygen to the miners 2100 feet below the surface and diffuse the methane but about 5 15 pm on sunday mr defosset said some rock fell from a roof section near a large battery charger and apparently caused sparks that ignited gas about 32 men were in the mine mostly maintenance workers performing repairs to machinery and 6 were in the area of the explosion three of those men got out but three others were injured when word of the explosion spread through the mine on a special paging system 10 men working elsewhere raced to the site three miles from the main elevator that took them underground once they got to the site there was a second much larger explosion possibly from methane that was trapped when the first explosion damaged ventilation shafts mr defosset said three bodies were removed from the mine and a fourth miner died of burns at a birmingham hospital today the federal mine safety agency quickly sent specialized rescue equipment to the site but agency officials said workers had been unable to use it because they encountered high levels of methane deep underground which could produce another explosion the agency also closed all operations at the mine and will investigate the accident no sign of the explosion could be seen above ground but the entrance to the mine with its conveyer belts shaft openings and mountains of stored coal is only a tip of the giant iceberg underneath schematic drawings of the mine at the company offices show tunnels laid out in the orderly pattern of a major metropolitan street grid punctuated by ventilation shafts and elevators the three walter mines in the area produce about seven million tons of bituminous coal a year for use in electric generating plants about 1300 people work in the mines part of the huge black warrior basin coal and gas field under northern alabama and mississippi and there are about 330 workers in mine no 5 said officials of the united mine workers of america local 2368 which represents the workers the company has a mixed safety record with fewer serious injuries than the industry this year but nearly double the industry average last year according to the federal mine safety and health administration a construction worker was killed in a fall at one of the local mines last month and in 1993 four men were seriously injured in a gas explosion at the no 5 mine one of those men wade gibson 43 came to the mine workers union hall today to show his support mr gibson suffered burns to more than three fourths of his body and his face though healed is now a disfigured patchwork of skin grafts and plastic surgery he never went underground again and is now retired i know exactly what they went through mr gibson said their bodies were on fire just like mine was if they 're gone at least they wo n't have to live through the pain of the burns if those missing have died the accident would be the worst in an american coal mine since dec 19 1984 when a faulty air compressor ignited a fire that killed 27 workers in the wilberg mine near orangeville utah one of the miners who survived sunday 's explosion michael mcie 42 considered himself lucky to have sustained only second degree burns i had just gotten a drink of water and walked out into the entry and the next thing i knew i felt like i was in a tornado mr mcie said from his bed at the dch regional medical center in tuscaloosa where he was listed in good condition with two broken ribs and a bruised foot and knee i rolled around to put the fire out on my clothes and then i got out brookwood where many of the miners live was already filled with half staff american flags and god bless america signs because of the terrorist attacks in new york and at the pentagon the parallels between the accident and the attack left many residents shaken it 's a tough situation knowing your parents are over there underground and ca n't get out said wayne mcbride principal of brookwood high school which several children of the trapped workers attend it 's a tragedy it 's not as big as new york but there are still lives at stake
