 if you are in the mood for a warm belly full of porridge there is no shortage of raw materials in addition to staples like steel cut oats and hot rice cereals there are ancient grains packed so full of proteins amino acids calcium and fiber they make brown rice look like junk food porridge you ask if the word sounds antiquarian it is no wonder porridge has been stuffed into a pouch of instant flakes and appropriated by the microwave tear here i figured i could top that nostalgic for true flavor at breakfast and impressed with the sheer abundance of exotic whole grains i posed a challenge to myself to find smooth cashmere flow and a pleasant chew in the same bite a sort of breakfast pilaf think you know your grains be careful the picture can become fuzzy fast grains are the edible seeds of annual grasses like wheat barley and oats when a grain is cultivated for human consumption it becomes a cereal grain rice the only cereal grain grown in water is not the same as wild rice which is not even a rice it is however a grain not all seeds are grains quinoa and amaranth for example are not members of the grass family and thus are not grains but they behave as if they are by succumbing to cooking or popping buckwheat is neither wheat nor grain couscous an imposter it is pasta quinoa revered by the incas is pleasantly neutral in flavor when cooked its coiled center springs open amaranth used by the aztecs and teff from ethiopia are minute slightly sweet and exceptionally delicate but with a tiny caviarlike crunch amaranth is almost malted teff tastes of hazelnut and each is stickier than quinoa with no space to waste these little beads are the most nutrient dense of all kamut an ancient relative of modern durum wheat originally from egypt is a brawny frankly chewy grain with a sweet wheaty flavor with their protective armor of bran a grain 's outer coating and inner compartment or germ the heart of the grain and its reproductive package all whole grains are nutritional powerhouses high in protein b vitamins and fiber the slower digestion this extra baggage demands makes for greater nutritional absorption and a better regulation of blood sugar if you are watching your carbohydrates refined grains like instant oatmeal and cream of wheat are the bad guys stripped of their outer layer in milling and divested of their germ they are left with a starchy endosperm and little to no nutritional value your local market or health food store probably carries many of these and i 've found the following mail order sources to be reliable barry farm enterprises in wapakoneta ohio wwwbarryfarmcom or 419 228 4640 and bob 's red mill natural foods in milwaukie ore 800 349 2173 or wwwbobsredmillcom with a bounty of loose grains on my counter and a shiver of trepidation i got out my saucepans all of the grains cooked in the time it takes to make a pot of steel cut oats and they were all delicious i was so smitten i wanted them together in one bowl a united nations of grains but stove space and practicality pre empted my largesse in the end i had two creamy grain bases corn grits and farina and any number of crunchy and chewy options to ply them with i had to cheat a little grits are not whole grain the corn having lost its hull but they do have a supple toothsomeness and tons of flavor farina whole wheat berries ground fine offers creamy satin beads the final recipes are roughly mesoamerican and far eastern in their orientation but there is no limit to captivating combinations and accouterments the diminutive supergrains all cook in 15 to 20 minutes and are happy to share a pot with one another some whole grains need to be rinsed quinoa barley kamut and anything else that looks dusty amaranth and teff are so small they would need a tea strainer or cheesecloth so i left them alone dry toasting is nice too these pilafs are sumptuous brunch affairs clearly not for weekday mornings it could be argued that their lavish accessories diminish their healthy profiles if you are inclined to reach for the stevia and soy milk be my guest i prefer my sunday mornings dotted with butter and sprinkled with a bit of luxury
