 ours is an era in which there is not much fishing that is as good as it used to be and even less that is better than it ever was the rio grande on the island of tierra del fuego off the southern tip of south america is a happy anomaly over the last 30 years the river has produced sea run brown trout in steadily increasing sizes according to mel krieger the west coast writer and fly fishing evangelist who recently introduced me to this stream the rio grande right now is the greatest anadromous fishery on earth big statement but then so are the trout in six days of fishing at the sprawling estancia maria behety in bone chilling water and tooth rattling wind i landed a half dozen trout over 15 pounds and one 27 1 2 pounder on a no 12 prince nymph the piscatorial equivalent i suppose of shooting a grizzly with a slingshot my accomplishments were just about average for our group of 14 anglers why are the trout so big there are probably a combination of factors a strict catch and release policy over the length of the river no commercial fishing or netting where the rio grande begins in the atlantic the tendency of species to achieve their largest sizes at the extremities of their range and krieger says a warming of the antarctic waters that has enriched the whole food chain i arrived late last month braced for the legendary winds that whip across the patagonian steppe providentially the winds were usually no worse than a gusty october afternoon at montauk an 8 weight rod more than did the job at twilight on march 28 i spent an hour that i now remember more fully than i can recall some years a morning session had yielded a couple of 10 pounders and a few airborne leaps for freedom by considerably larger fish that spit straightened or broke my hooks that afternoon we went to a stretch of river where a short cast into a deep pool was supposed to summon leviathan but the water was cold and the fish sluggish my partner mickey schwartz of el paso and our guide alberto molina gomez were stymied maybe it was the fearsome aspect of schwartz 's hat that put the trout down it was a towering alaskan fur headpiece reminiscent of cossack battle gear gomez 's more likely explanation was that the lack of a current left our flies looking lifeless and unappetizing at 7 o'clock my inner fisherman told me forget it pal but gomez perhaps the most experienced and knowledgeable guide on the river was determined vamos al otro poso he said let 's go to another pool i hesitated alberto it 's 7 o'clock we quit at 8 fifteen minutes to get there does n't leave us much time to fish but you 're the guide the sun descended the sky turned a brazen crimson behind the mountains of chile melting snows from a late season storm brought the water temperature down to 38 degrees we pulled up to a bend in the river aca gomez announced right about here as it is with salmon rio grande trout returning to spawn often stop at predictable spots sometimes no bigger than a living room take the downstream bend schwartz offered in his courtly west texas drawl i tied on a no 12 prince nymph best described as a combination zug bug and classic catskills wet fly a fish rolled reminiscent of the porpoising motion of a rolling tarpon it is a seductive display but rarely does it result in a take i ignored it and quarter cast downstream throwing in an upstream mend to give the 200 grain sink tip time to carry the fly to the bottom where the trout would surely be if they were anywhere the rod pointed straight at the moon full and orange as it rose over the bank a flock of banduria ibises whose call is a cheering combination of a stutter and a giggle flew over me for two weeks their evening flights heralded a few moments of good fishing the fly stopped and the line became taut i pulled back bottom i told myself thinking that i had hung up on a champa a caved in grassy bank but then the bottom moved it gave two jolting thumps i reeled up the fish took line first my shooting head then my running line then my backing i followed along the river bank trying to stay even with the fish in counterpoint to my frenzy the trout shook its head with a percussive snap my rod tip bowed then it recovered slowly over and over every now and then the fish burst for the cover of the far bank i countered by moving my rod tip my wrist ached my fingers began to seize up in the gathering darkness and deepening cold tranquilo gomez counseled which roughly translates to easy boy i backed away from the stream slowly and with a light tread like someone easing out of a room so as not to wake a sleeping baby luck was with me the trout came to the surface gomez dipped his net and captured the fish in the moonlight i could see it was bright silver a recent returnee from the ocean full of vigor and fight he took out his scale twelve and a half kilos i did the math 27 1 2 pounds its length nearly 30 inches on any other stream if i caught a fish that was 30 inches long it would make my year gomez revived it in the current for a minute he let go of its tail the huge trout disappeared into the deep dark water slowly like a silver ghost melting back into the night as the memory of it took up permanent residence in my soul
