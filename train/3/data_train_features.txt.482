 it is pleasantly incongruous to see sunflowers and rings of millet hanging as seasonal decorations from a 14 foot colorado spruce outdoors at longwood gardens in kennett square pa and at winterthur in delaware a 16 foot douglas fir indoors in the conservatory is decked out with dried flowers from the winterthur gardens both are inspirations but my favorite is the one that feeds the birds at longwood gardens as i watched the birds dive into orange cups filled with sunflower seeds i started making a mental list for next year 's garden i would have to plant millet indian corn sorghum and barley i would have to grow sunflowers safflowers and red cockscombs silvery pods of nigella or love in a mist and then have the patience to dry them you could grow about 80 percent of this in your garden said lois lawton who keeps the longwood tree brimming with food for wildlife one year i used grapevines to lash big sunflowers around the trunk and it looked like a beehive this year she used fruit from the garden including native crab apples strung on florist wire and hung like christmas balls and slices of golden quince which caught the light like stained glass she got other edible ornaments from the local supermarket raisins strung on waxed dental floss cranberries tucked into the round holes of dried lotus pods carved out oranges full of seeds and halved fresh coconut birds love coconut ms lawton said they eat the flesh and then we pack the shells with suet she warned against pure peanut butter which can lead to birds choking in cold weather so her pine cones are stuffed with a combination of peanut butter cornmeal and beef fat she also hangs whole oranges like balls with deep slits cut through the rinds orioles love to peck out the flesh she said count on a tree loaded with these treats to attract those orioles along with cedar waxwings dark eyed juncos eastern towhees purple finches catbirds flickers mockingbirds nuthatches ruby crowned kinglets sparrows woodpeckers and even the yellow bellied sapsucker but watch out with those orange cups i get dive bombed by the chickadees when i refill them ms lawton said longwood 's other observations of christmas can be seen at wwwlongwoodgardensorg i drove down route 52 to winterthur the henry francis du pont estate where the 16 foot high douglas fir reminded me of an ornate dutch painting we start collecting daffodils in the spring and then we take a lot of flowers from the cutting gardens said bonnie a beck who has been heading this dried flower operation for 14 years the trick is to dry flowers in their prime some can simply be hung upside down in a dark dry room flowers that dry well this way include larkspur delphinium cockscomb hydrangea limonium lavender yarrow safflower echinops statice artemisia salvia crocosmia queen anne 's lace globe amaranth eryngium and goldenrod but flowers with a higher moisture content like roses lilies dahlias zinnias and peonies wo n't dry that way mrs beck preserves hers in airtight boxes filled with silica gel a desiccant or you can use a mix of one part borax to one part cornmeal which has the same effect how long to leave flowers in the box depends on the thickness of the petals drying could take five days to a week if it 's crispy it 's done she said if it 's not put it back in the box you ca n't leave it in too long once the flowers are dry she stores them in airtight boxes with a little silica gel blue silica gel turns pink when it absorbs moisture but you can dry it out again in a 350 degree oven drying flowers is explained in flower arranging the winterthur way by alberta a melloy winterthur 1795 published this fall and available at wwwwinterthurorg then there 's the art of assembling the flowers on the tree starting from the top down she suggests using a tree like the douglas fir which has branches relatively close together everything has to be wired to the tree and colors do not always dry true to their hue any blue red flower dries to dark and purple mrs beck said so if you want a red you have to start with an orange flower and white can dry and look dirty no member of the composite or daisy family looks very good though coneflowers do n't fare too badly and imagine trying to wire butter and eggs to a branch it boggles the mind i do n't think i 'm suited for this kind of fussy detail work but a tree for birds that i can tackle
