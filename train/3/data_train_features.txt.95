 after 13 years in mystic the taste of connecticut food festival is moving to the new waterfront park in nearby new london to take advantage of what is fast becoming recognized as the region 's prime site for waterfront events the 15 million park which was constructed in time for opsail 2000 the international tall ships festival will play host to about 30 restaurants in outdoor booths for three days starting on friday for the first time the festival will be against a backdrop of eight tall ships readings by 60 local and national authors and paintings by a variety of artists this weekend as taste of connecticut combines with the boats books brushes festival opsail in many ways set the standard for what we could do and where we could do it said richard m brown new london 's city manager we learned a lot about the services we have to provide how to pay attention to food and merchandising how to move people in and out expeditiously two years later those lessons have begun to pay off not only did the city prove that it could handle the huge crowds the parade of sails drew about 250000 people but it showed off a newly refurbished waterfront we know if it was n't for the waterfront park we would n't be having this type of event mr brown said the waterfront park makes us very attractive as a visiting spot for the tall ships and having the tall ships in new london makes us attractive as the host for taste of connecticut we 're looking to make the maximum use of the waterfront and one of the things that always seems to draw people is food suzanne myler of daniels productions in west hartford which promotes taste of connecticut said the larger site in new london enabled the food festival to double in size in terms of the number of booths and that more visitors can be accommodated mystic could accommodate 50000 or 60000 people tops and we 're hoping that by combining the two festivals we 'll do better than that this year ms myler said there 's no question that it 's a great location it will offer a little bit of everything in addition to staples like chowder and pizza taste of connecticut will offer specialties like chocolate suicide truffle from armen 's gourmet endings in marlborough which has won best dessert at the festival several times and the popular garlic chicken on a stick from thai taste in new haven i think we 'll have a lot more people turn out than we would if both events were held separately said nancy tyler a spokeswoman for boats books and brushes though the event drew fewer than 10000 people last year it came right after the sept 11 terrorist attacks which many believe affected attendance since its inception taste of connecticut has been the premier fund raising event of the year for the mystic community center a recreational facility that started the festival as a two day event in 1989 and drew 12000 people since the first year the festival has served about 435000 portions of food to an estimated 250000 people karen a quinn executive director of the mystic community center said the festival has raised 75000 to 85000 annually for the center 's programs she added that the event had been limited for several years by the size of the park where has been held new london has really become the focus of our region ms quinn said they 've spent a lot of money upgrading the waterfront and there is a lot of room to grow there mystic is still wonderful but this has become such a huge event we need the space the opportunity to combine with an event like boats books and brushes really made it something we could n't pass up a larger site means that newer restaurants in the region will have access to taste of connecticut she said including the michael jordan steakhouse from the mohegan sun casino which will offer garlic bread and ribs and cascades at the new london holiday inn whose menu will feature tropicana dreamsicle cheesecake linnea lindstrom executive director of the mystic chamber of commerce said that as taste of connecticut grew larger it also found itself at odds with the residential neighborhood around its location we 're very sorry to see it leave ms lindstrom said it was a signature event for mystic it 's sad to see after so many years and being such a success that it 's leaving for new london but at the same time it really became a victim of its own success i think it will have a lot more breathing room now i think this is a real positive move for the community center although new london will receive 20000 for the use of the pier some locals are not pleased with the arrangement mayor lloyd beachy of new london said some people are upset that local restaurateurs were not given preference in their booth locations mr beachy added that others were upset that the festival will still benefit the mystic community center we 're doing all this for the first time so we learn as we go through the process mr beachy said we 're getting to the point where we had to address how we re going to use the park the park is becoming too big and too popular to just let things happen organizers hope that the combination of something to do and something to eat will prove too popular to resist but some vendors think the organizers are tampering with what has been for years a recipe for success in the past we 'll try it in the new location and then we 'll have to assess how it 's been on sales said robert homiski who with his wife armen owns armen 's gourmet endings it 's been a very good event for us for a lot of years we 'll have to wait and see if it 's the same in new london maurice m beebe owner of the north end deli in groton has participated for the last seven years she said the price for a booth had gone from 500 to 750 after the first year if it was gangbusters and we all made a lot of money mr beebe said i could see raising the price but to do it in the first year i think was a little premature but i 'm still very optimistic this has always been a great event for us and i 'm hopeful that it will still do well in the new location
