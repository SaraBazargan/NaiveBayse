 kenneth king 's dance performance at st mark 's church on tuesday night eventually became a book signing during the metamorphosis words danced and movements seemed kinetic messages the event was tied to mr king 's book writing in motion body language technology which has just been published by wesleyan university press since the 1960 's mr king has been combining dance steps with words his texts have ranged from philosophical speculations to word games and his agile body is as quick as his wit at st mark 's mr king was joined by a guest artist frances alenikoff a dancer and writer who shares his love of words and movement the title of their new work hotel tiresias refers to the blind prophet in greek mythology who was granted the power to experience life as both a man and a woman the production made ms alenikoff and mr king seem two aspects of a single oracular personality ms alenikoff sat in a chair chanting ominously and occasionally pounding the floor with a stick mr king wearing dark glasses sped through the space darting and twisting both performers appeared to be casting spells in twilight dust a solo for ms alenikoff she both wailed in a flamboyant manner and spoke of such ordinary things as slamming car doors lentil soup and a child 's desire to dance her stentorian manner gave everything she mentioned cosmic significance mr king quoted passages from his book while he danced in writing in motion he described voices moving through him like sonic rivers called dancing a form of writing in space and recited tongue twisters while jiggling giddily then the audience was invited to talk with mr king and ms alenikoff and books were made available for purchase and signing the program was presented by the church 's danspace project and movement research 25th anniversary performance events in collaboration with the poetry project
