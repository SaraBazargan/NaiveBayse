 as the presidential contest heads toward the showdowns in iowa and new hampshire the battle to control congress is shaping up with considerably less attention from the public that is understandable since only about 30 of the 435 campaigns for house seats are expected to be close yet even in this early phase the congressional election offers some important clues about the public mood and the hopes and fears of party leaders democrats convinced they have a good chance of recapturing the house plan a series of confrontations this year on health care education and other issues house republicans the onetime revolutionaries are trying to soften their contentious image last week they even dropped their tried and true strategy of pushing sweeping tax cuts as the centerpiece of their electoral approach in years past the congressional republicans tried to outdo themselves each new year with more and more extravagant tax cuts they apparently have recognized that at a time of extraordinary prosperity and in spite of looming budget surpluses tax cuts take a back seat among voters to more long term concerns like health care retirement security and education speaker dennis hastert 's latest proposal for 135 billion worth of tax cuts over the next 10 years is only about a tenth of the tax cut promoted by gov george bush of texas the front runner for the republican presidential nomination could it be that republican lawmakers are more attuned to the wishes of voters than the texas governor it would not be the first time that mr bush and the house republicans have differed on what the voters want when the republicans recaptured the house in 1994 they had one of the greatest political opportunities of a generation to solidify their reputation as a party that could govern they squandered it with their petulant government shutdowns extremist agenda and the ethical problems of speaker newt gingrich the impeachment drive of 1998 hurt them almost as much as it hurt president clinton mr gingrich forced to resign as speaker was not even invited to attend a recent celebration of the contract with america he founded no matter how well the gop candidate does in the presidential race republicans may not be able to improve much on their razor thin margin in the house most of the vacant seats up for grabs this year are held by republicans many of them in districts carried by president clinton this has fed the democrats hopes they believe they have recruited good candidates done well in fund raising and even better in forging their message in the senate republicans are likely to retain control but there are thought to be more vulnerable republican incumbents than democrats no matter who controls congress the margins will probably be small this means that in 2001 congress and the new president will face something that gets left out of election year rhetoric the necessity of bipartisanship presidential candidates like to talk about bold initiatives but neither democratic health care reform nor republican tax cuts stand much change unless someone reaches across the aisle it could be that at a time of contentiousness among candidates the electorate is once again signaling a desire for a different kind of congress one in which the two sides try to work together and to get along
