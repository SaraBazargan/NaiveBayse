 kevin compton a 48 year old grain farmer recently walked into his corn field to inspect the damage from a summer long drought he tore open an ear of corn and grimaced look at this little bitty ear he said revealing a stunted partly rotted corn cob this wo n't amount to nothing everything 's gone mr compton then hopped in his ford explorer and drove a mile east to inspect some soybean acreage it was even worse you see these spots he said fingering a withering pale green soybean pod these are dying when you look at these pods you see about 8 or 10 normally you 'd have 30 or 40 farmers all over the state are making similar assessments because of what state officials say is one of the worst droughts in the plains states in decades this community in northeastern kansas is one of the areas hit hardest for the second straight year kansas and parts of missouri and nebraska have suffered through an extremely dry summer that has brought back memories of the 1930 's dust bowl a shortage of rainfall and a series of 100 degree days have destroyed crops on millions of acres and dried up streams creeks and rivers state officials said all over kansas there have been scenes of loss and despair farmers have been harvesting corn that matured too early and turning it into animal feed ranchers have been hauling water to cattle grazing on shriveled pastures even grain sorghum which is considered more drought resistant than other crops is dying in the fields recent downpours that flooded the eastern part of the state came too late to save many crops state and agriculture officials said the rains were beneficial but they did n't save anything said mary knapp the kansas state climatologist we need continuing rains to end this some farmers have had to take drastic steps farmers are cutting their corn for silage because it 's not good enough to grow said lisa taylor a spokeswoman for the kansas department of agriculture farmers had hoped this year would be better than last when they lost more than 1 billion worth of crops to drought the losses could be as high this year congress offered about 200 million in drought aid in 2002 this year state officials are planning to ask the federal government for more relief indeed the united states agriculture department 's weather crop report recently showed that about 55 percent of the state 's corn crop and 61 percent of its soybean crop were poor to very poor one of the few bright spots for kansas farmers was last winter 's wheat crop which resulted in an unusually good harvest many farmers who expect huge losses from this summer 's corn and soybean crops are hoping for another strong winter wheat crop which is planted in october and harvested in june there is already a rush to buy seed for winter wheat agricultural officials here say kansas ranchers are also faring well by selling their cattle early to take advantage of a strong demand for beef market prices are extremely good said todd domer a spokesman for the kansas livestock association they 're near all time highs the pessimistic report from the department of agriculture came at the end of august when parts of kansas were suffering through 11 consecutive days of 100 degree heat on day 12 the temperature was 99 parts of kansas were so dry that restrictions on water use and rules against trash burning were put into effect to conserve water and prevent wildfires some reservoirs were 14 to 20 feet below normal levels along interstate 70 which stretches in this state from kanorado near the colorado border east to kansas city there are dying trees acres of stunted soybeans and fields of deformed earless corn corn fields that typically average 150 bushels an acre are now yielding just 30 or 40 local farmers say the harvest began weeks ahead of schedule because farmers wanted to salvage part of the corn here in the northeastern part of the state the remaining corn is so brittle that a recent wind storm knocked over huge fields of it soybean farmers are not much better off many soybean crops look as though they have stopped growing altogether the dark greens have gone pale like some tree tops this is the second year in a row said kenlon johannes a spokesman for the kansas soybean association it was bad in 2000 2001 was ok 2002 was bad and this year is bad three out of the last four years have been tough after going nearly two months with little or no precipitation people in kansas were joking that they would not know rain if it hit them smack on the head rain what 's rain said stanley mccauley a farmer driving a pickup truck on main street in nearby highland just before the downpours at ernie 's restaurant and pool hall in downtown highland everyone had something to say about the weather people are driving trucks up and down the nemaha river said artie lucas an insurance agent who was eating chicken strips and potatoes that 's a tributary of the missouri river someone in the crowded hall called on wilbur winter 87 to comment on the drought mr winter a retired farmer sought to put things in historical perspective i remember '36 he said that was the dust bowl we had 36 days over 100 degree temperatures this is n't as bad as then but this is bad in a state dominated by farmers and the business of farming the drought has rippled through the economy everyone 's tightening up said emmett cole who operates a grain and fertilizer business in highland they 've quit spending money and they 're cutting back on their farm inputs while the rains came too late for the summer crop they could help the winter wheat in everest the first rains came late in the afternoon people all over town ran outside as though they had never seen rain lanette mckee the postmaster went out and stood in front of the post office to marvel at the sight of raindrops pounding the sidewalks i ca n't believe this is rain ms mckee said boy is it coming
