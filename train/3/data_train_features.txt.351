warner brothers where from 1933 to 1963 in collaboration with other legendary animators including tex avery and friz freleng he helped create bugs daffy porky pig and elmer fudd and other stars of the looney tunes and merry melodies productions and he single handedly invented road runner and wile e coyote which underscored his belief that the success of cartoon characters lay in their acting not in dialogue one of his strict rules for the coyote road runner series was no dialogue ever except 'beep beep the series which made its debut in 1949 was a minimalist revolution with its stark desert setting and the tight parameters of the coyote 's always futile efforts to obliterate his co star other rules were no outside force can harm the coyote only his own ineptitude or the failure of the acme products and the coyote is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures mr jones also invented the gallant gallic skunk pepe le pew marvin martian michigan j frog and gossamer mr jones and his collaborators at warner brothers were so successful in making the carrot chomping bugs bunny into a lifelike celebrity that a child once accused him of being nothing more than a member of the cartoon paparazzi a small child once said to me 'you do n't draw bugs bunny you draw pictures of bugs bunny mr jones said adding that 's a very profound observation because it means that he thinks the characters are alive which as far as i am concerned is true mr jones so identified with his characters that at times he gave interviews on their behalf bugs never anticipated such a fuss in the first place said mr jones on bugs bunny 's 50th birthday bugs had no concept that people would celebrate his 50th because he never thought his pictures would last mr jones said all of us thought they 'd

the family moved to california and as a boy in hollywood he often watched through a fence as charlie chaplin rehearsed his films the young chuck jones also worked as a child extra in mack sennett comedies but he often credited his start in drawing to his father 's succession of failed businesses which left pencils and stationery strewn around the house he dropped out of high school but attended the chouinard art institute he began his career cleaning off cels the transparent sheets that animators used to draw the moving parts of a frame mr jones moved up in the ranks becoming a cel

with a bit part in a cartoon called porky 's hare hunt but it was in 1940 that bugs catapulted to stardom in a wild hare from there mr jones went on to sketch bugs for more than 50 years in those early years all the classic cartoons were drawn in the same fashion that movies were filmed at 24 frames a second when the cartoons reached the peak of their popularity in the 1940 's and 50 's they ran for exactly six minutes and were 540 feet long each requiring 5000 drawings a good animator could do about 15 seconds of film time a week when road runner and wile e coyote made their debut in
