 it was just two weeks ago that the boats left viaduct harbor for their first battles in the three month slog that is the america 's cup challenger series the first of two round robins is now over and the nine syndicates competing for the right to race in february against the cup defender team new zealand have revealed if not their keels at least their identities they have separated into three distinct packs the rockets the duds and the emergency cases oneworld challenge and the swiss team alinghi are clearly the rockets in the series known as the louis vuitton cup oneworld is undefeated in eight races alinghi lost only to oneworld and by a mere 16 seconds while the boats are certainly competently helmed oneworld is skippered by the four time america 's cup veteran peter gilmour alinghi by the two time cup winner russell coutts it is their hull speeds that have to alarm the competition speed in america 's cup style match racing is a double whammy it allows a boat to get ahead of its competition then once upwind of its rival foul the air coming down the course slowing the other boat further the one high dollar boat that does not have speed is larry ellison 's usa 76 which sails for his team oracle bmw the ellison team took a gamble on a boat with less sail area than its competitors in the hope that the high winds of a new zealand spring would provide plenty of power the winds though have been volatile at the top of the permissible range one day at the bottom the next and ellison 's team has had mixed luck going 5 3 in the week off between round robins the second one will eliminate one of the nine teams team oracle will most likely do some serious reprogramming perhaps adding sail area up top or launching its second boat usa 71 if the fixes do not take ellison could end up watching the vuitton cup finals from the basketball court on the afterdeck of katana his 250 foot yacht the duds are easy enough to sort out the french team le defi areva has not won despite having a boat that streaks upwind it has lost two races at the finish line because of penalties and has yet to win a start the italian team mascalzone latino has only one victory against areva the italian team members the rascals as they call themselves are favorites in auckland partly because they have declared that their mission is to have fun but also because they do not pose a threat to team new zealand the emergency cases are the ones undergoing radical surgery in the case of patrizio bertelli 's prada challenge it is a nose job prada is replacing the blunt bow on its second boat with the elbowed bow in use by most of the other syndicates at 3 4 prada is the biggest surprise of the challenger series the team won the vuitton cup in 2000 but its second appearance in auckland has been a disaster after losing his first race bertelli fired his designer doug peterson now bertelli is after his boat with a hacksaw team dennis conner 's surgery happened a while back involuntarily when its second boat sank off long beach calif in july crushing the bow on the ocean bottom conner had the boat refloated and changed the bow slightly the results are still unknown usa 77 is still in its cradle in team conner 's compound on halsey street the other boat usa 66 has been nimble downwind but sluggish against the breeze conner who is 4 4 has a history of slow starts so no one is counting him out but he will have to make adjustments on land before big changes occur on the water for the british syndicate gbr challenge the procedure was total helmsman replacement after losing his first four races the leader of the syndicate peter harrison took the wheel from andy green and gave it to the slightly more weather worn andy beadsworth the british have not lost since they beat oracle in light air in the first round robin at 4 4 they are tied with team dennis conner and have set themselves up as most likely to be a spoiler in later rounds for now though the battle to watch when racing resumes tuesday is between oneworld and alinghi it is a clash of opposites with its environmental leanings and happy looking royal blue boat oneworld is the goody goody of the cup alinghi is the bad guy the syndicate head the billionaire ernesto bertarelli is a recluse alinghi 's boat is dark gray and menacing coutts won the america 's cup for new zealand in 1995 and repeated in 2000 before defecting to sail for land locked switzerland if his team wins the vuitton cup coutts will be sailing in auckland to take the cup away from the country where he grew up coutts and other defectors from team new zealand say their countrymen are supportive of their effort to be professional sailors but the loudest cheers in viaduct harbor last week were for oneworld when it returned from its 16 second victory over alinghi
