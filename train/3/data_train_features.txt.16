 ralph nader was on a tear railing against chief executives salaries the corporate dominated campaign finance system and cuts in factory inspections several of the steelworkers seated around him were nodding and then nodding again in silent approval for a few minutes at least on friday it seemed as if the steelworkers cynicism about politics and politicians had evaporated and they were receiving the truth or at least a truth they rarely hear you 're the guys who work hard said mr nader the green party candidate for president you 're the guys who pay the taxes you 're the guys who fight the wars and then they say 'tough we 're closing the factory it 's globalization and then they use factories overseas where dictators repress the wages to compete against you mr nader whose words though not his speaking style are laced with emotion then laid into vice president al gore and other democrats saying they have done little for labor because they have been able to take labor 's support for granted when you 're taken for granted you 're taken he said when organized labor can say to these candidates 'you 're not going to take us for granted anymore we have an alternative and the alternative is nader and the green party then they 'll start calling afterward the 20 steelworkers who had gathered in a small ohio state university classroom to hear mr nader gave him rave reviews and many of them vowed to vote for him this november mr nader was in columbus for rallies with green party members environmentalists and steelworkers i 'd say nader is the best of anyone said david cole an electrician at ak steel 's mill in mansfield ohio i really like him i have n't seen much from anyone else his friend and co worker larry pugh was just as enthusiastic i think he has the right answers said mr pugh a crane operator at the plant where management locked out 620 workers last september he gives us a choice because the democrats and republicans have sold us down the river this outpouring of enthusiasm for mr nader worries many democrats who fear that so many steelworkers auto workers teamsters and other union members will vote for him this fall that mr gore could lose in ohio and other midwestern swing states for the democrats an added concern is that two of the most powerful unions in the midwest the teamsters and the united auto workers have flirted with mr nader and have not endorsed mr gore even though the afl cio is backing the vice president many steelworkers are still angry at mr gore because he backed the agreement to normalize trade relations with china which many union members fear will accelerate the exodus of american factories to china although mr nader is best known for his crusading on consumer protection and the environment he has grown closer to labor unions in recent years fighting with them against the china trade deal the world trade organization and the north american free trade agreement all the steelworkers here hailed mr nader but several said they would still vote for mr gore because they feared gov george w bush would win if mr nader drained too many votes from the vice president i 'd like to thank you for championing our issues skip hall another a steelworker who drove in from mansfield told mr nader you 're terrifying the democrats you know this is going to be a very close election in 1980 i was dissatisfied with jimmy carter i backed ted kennedy and we ended up with ronald reagan he gave us a bad supreme court we 're still living with that today that 's the dilemma we face today the same thing could happen with you the excitement generated by mr nader also concerns some labor leaders john j sweeney the afl cio 's president has repeatedly urged union members to back mr gore saying it is important to prevent mr bush from winning because working with a republican congress he might push through legislation to weaken unions and job safety laws george becker president of the united steelworkers of america was one of labor 's most vociferous critics of the china deal but he says it is time to line up behind mr gore he said in an interview that labor 's support for mr nader was modest and would grow smaller and he predicted that many union members leaning toward mr nader would ultimately vote for mr gore upon realizing that mr nader can not win there are two viable candidates al gore and george w bush and we 're picking the one closest to the viewpoints of our members and the issues of working people mr becker said nader 's a fine man he takes a lot of positions that are near and dear to us but he is not a viable candidate in that regard anybody who would support ralph nader we think would lessen al gore 's chances of winning david leland chairman of the ohio democratic party said that the race between mr gore and mr bush was close in his state but that he did not think mr nader would hurt the vice president recent polls show mr nader getting 4 percent of the vote in ohio compared with more than 10 percent in california but mr leland said those were high water marks that were bound to fall most people know a vote for ralph nader is a wasted vote at best and a vote for george bush at worst he said mr becker said he hoped mr gore would become more outspoken on workers issues to excite union members about his candidacy indeed on monday mr gore is scheduled to hold a town hall meeting in cleveland with 75 steelworkers from ohio pennsylvania indiana and illinois the nader campaign sees this as a move to keep union members from drifting toward their candidate mr nader said a central purpose of his candidacy was to move the democratic party left on labor and other issues to make it easier for unions to organize mr nader called for making it legal for a union to boycott not just the company it is striking against but other companies that do business with it such boycotts were banned by the taft hartley act in 1947 he also called for requiring employers to pay triple damages when they illegally fire workers for supporting a union asserting that he should be included in any presidential debates mr nader said he would seek to force mr gore and mr bush to address work related issues like occupational safety that have been largely ignored during the campaign gore will tell you 'i 'm for you i 'm going to fight for you i 'm for a ban on using replacement workers in strikes mr nader said but what has he done in eight years i do n't care what you 're for i want to know what you 've done talk is cheap
