 symphony concerts and operas tend to be such solemn affairs that like the one eyed man in the realm of the blind even the bad joke resounds this would explain the successful premise of peter schickele 's p d q bach concerts but not their durability these 37 year old evening length lampoons returned to avery fisher hall on friday night with the familiar props intact a made up baroque composer the disheveled mr schickele as lecturer conductor and performer the dour stage manager william walters a first class pickup orchestra gracefully conducted by ken jean a handful of odd instruments and a faithful audience well drilled in the rituals of these events the first class orchestra is no mere luxury given the sophistication of mr schickele 's musical burlesques it needs to be it is the layers meticulously applied that keep p d q bach from disappearing giggling into air vents above peel away the musicological puns and beneath them you will find correct german turned against itself the howdy volkstheater was a discovery for me look past the absurdity of professor schickele 's fictional teaching post and you will sense the desperation of a minor academic buried in some plains state university system the pratfalls and other physical humor can be lame but so carefully honed into the year in year out p d q bach routine that they are not only awaited but demanded the outer layers of the p d q bach music begin with titles desecration of the house schleptet the civilian barber two and a half variations and continue with misplaced orchestral toots and bangs we have also come to laugh almost automatically at evergreen quotes from brahms stravinsky and popular song as they emerge from baroque boilerplate but underneath other things are going on sophisticated interruptions cleverly placed accents an off kilter stream of music that always makes sense a delicate ear for instrumental combinations chaconne a son gout was both a laugh a second and an impressive ivesian haze of metric turmoil and ingenious contrapuntal dovetailing there was no necessity to hear beyond the musical saw and koto in combination or related nonsense like it but quality is usually sensed even by those not looking for it it keeps one coming back without necessarily knowing why if there is a certain tiredness to the p d q bach phenomenon that may be another layer of its charm mr schickele 's creation has more or less engulfed his other life as a composer and a very good one he is but he seems to accept with wry benevolence the unavoidable if distracting fame and fortune that has befallen him playing the bassoon in public as he did with near adequacy on friday also tends to keep him and his mythical partner on their toes
