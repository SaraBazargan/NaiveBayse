 president bush has instructed the team that will negotiate with north korea that the united states will not settle for another freeze on the country 's nuclear program instead senior administration officials said today washington will insist that the north dismantle both of its major nuclear weapons projects as part of any larger bargain with the united states in interviews today the officials said they had relatively low expectations for the first round of talks scheduled to take place next week in beijing the talks which some american officials fear could be delayed now that news of them has become public would be the first between the two countries in more than six months mr bush approved the overall plan for the negotiating strategy at a meeting tuesday with secretary of state colin l powell the officials said he told mr powell that he was not ready to discuss any kind of treaties with the north something the country has demanded until the nuclear threat is dismantled american officials said however that they were seeking new and creative ways to assure the north koreans that we are not looking to overthrow them to take them out a senior official said mr bush has issued several such assurances in recent months but american officials believe the iraq war may have prompted fears in the north korean leadership that they are next as mr bush addresses threats today in his first public comments on the talks mr powell said that the united states was placing no conditions on the negotiations and he told the associated press that the north would have an opportunity to present their positions to come into this trilateral meeting and speak candidly in front of the united states and the chinese it was china 's intervention that created the compromise leading to the negotiations north korea had insisted on direct talks with washington but mr bush had insisted on broad talks involving china japan south korea and russia administration officials said the initial talks would involve only the united states north korea and china but a state department spokesman philip t reeker said today that the united states hopes to expand the talks in later rounds we are looking for the early inclusion of japan and south korea he said privately south korean officials have told the united states that they would not agree to any financial commitments to the north that were made when they were not participating in the negotiations when american officials first confronted north korea with evidence that it was cheating on a 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons program several officials said no talks could take place before the north began dismantling its facilities but in recent months they have backed away from that precondition and next week 's talks if they go forward as scheduled will occur with the north proceeding with two separate programs that could produce weapons within months or years there 's an outward calm people are trying to project about this one senior intelligence official said but the fact of the matter is that if these talks do n't work out we would be faced with a north korea with six or eight nukes pretty soon rather than two possible weapons now one senior administration official said today that it now appears that north korea 's leaders decided as early as 1995 to attempt a clandestine program to produce weapons from highly enriched uranium over the next few years north korea secretly gathered technology from pakistan and other nations at the core of mr bush 's concern now his aides say is a fear that the united states may never be able to verify that the north has given up all of its nuclear projects even if a deal can be reached the main plutonium production plant at yongbyon is relatively easily monitored officials say but american officials are uncertain where the uranium project is or whether there is more than one mr bush has often discussed his distrust of kim jong il the north korean leader a man he has said he detests for starving his own people today the united nations commission on human rights overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning the north for all pervasive and severe restrictions on the freedoms of thought religion opinion expression assembly and association and for torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment of its citizens including imposition of the death penalty for political reasons with saddam hussein disposed of some administration officials who did not want to deal with north korea for fear of distracting attention from iraq are beginning to focus anew on the country that could place pressure on mr powell and his assistant secretary for east asia james a kelly to show that the negotiations are making progress but mr powell said today that he expected this is a beginning of a long intense process of discussion
