 the federal police continued today to evict more than 200 retirees most of them americans from their homes in a baja california resort under orders from mexico 's highest court which has ruled that the americans have no right to live there many of the american residents some furious some weeping in frustration as the federal police sealed their beachfront homes tried to negotiate with the new owners of the land seeking new terms under which they might be able to remain legal scholars in mexico and the united states disagree on whether the ruling has a larger implication for americans with homes in mexico but the raid on the baja beach tennis club in ensenada baja california where residences run from modest frame houses to million dollar villas came as a rude shock to the residents even though the eviction had been threatened for 13 years alejandro sanchez a retired banker from yuma ariz called the eviction led by more than 100 uniformed police a regular gestapo operation in fact it was a result of a bureaucratic mistake 27 years ago the mexican supreme court ruled mexico 's laws say foreigners can not own land within 35 miles of the coast or 65 miles from the united states border but they can lease the land for up to 50 years and build on it and own what they build under those terms several hundred thousand american citizens the precise numbers are unclear have residences in mexico many are retirees attracted by warm weather relatively low costs and a laid back way of life but their homes may have a shaky foundation as the residents of the baja beach tennis club discovered the land in dispute is a 250 acre sandbar part of a 37000 acre land grant awarded in 1973 by the government to about 80 families from the punta estero peninsula about 85 miles south of the american border by the late 1980 's the communal owners working through a mexican developer had leased most of the land on the peninsula to americans who paid up to 90000 for a 30 year lease and built homes a hotel cabanas tennis courts and swimming pools in 1987 seven partners in a private company sued to reclaim the peninsula they said they had bought the land in 1970 and that the government had illegally seized it through a bureaucratic error in 1996 after nine years of litigation the mexican supreme court agreed saying the 250 acre sandbar was mistakenly included in the land grant that it belonged to the partners and that the developer did not have legal title to sell or lease it but nothing happened and many of the american residents believed nothing ever would then last week the supreme court ordered eduardo robledo rincon the cabinet minister in charge of land reform to carry out the original finding or go to jail he complied in an interview mr robledo said the case had no bearing on any other foreign property owners but was a result of the irregularities in the land records and he added if the americans can strike an bargain with the new proprietors they do n't have to leave the place this may well happen the federal police told the evictees that they had 30 days to negotiate terms with the new owners until that month is up the fate of the american colony on the punta estero peninsula will remain unresolved
