 president bush finally turns out to have a clear forceful plan to deal with north korea 's defying the west by restarting its nuclear warhead assembly line the plan is to invade iraq the white house is trying to play down the crisis on the korean peninsula so that it can focus public attention on iraq instead but north korea raises risks that iraq does not because it already has a couple of nuclear weapons as well as artillery and missiles that can dump nerve gas on american military bases in asia and taepodong missiles that can drop nuclear warheads on alaska and soon the lower 48 states washington 's failure to engage north korea has in a few months turned a minor problem a uranium program that would take years to produce weapons into a major crisis the restarting of a reactor with enough plutonium to produce five additional warheads now the administration is allowing the situation to drift on a trajectory that conceivably could end up as another korean war the potential threat posed by north korea at this point is worse than anything else that we face said james laney a former ambassador to south korea this needs to be attended to now at the highest levels of this administration we need to get engaged with south korea and figure out how to solve this diplomatically since war would be catastrophic an official with an international organization puts it this way north korea scares the hell out of me i 've been there and it petrifies me by comparison iraq does n't scare me at all perhaps it 's a cheap shot to complain about north korea policy because the north is a country made for pundits here in the peanut gallery it 's possible to write with withering scorn about any alternative the administration could choose all our options regarding north korea are hideous and those responsible for making policy on north korea must have committed mortal sins in previous lives for god to torture them so to his credit mr bush has so far shown a most un bushian patience in reacting to north korean provocation we now find ourselves with three choices first we can negotiate with north korea which shows some signs of seeking the same kind of tentative opening to the west that china pursued in the late 1970 's the downside is that negotiation would reward bad behavior and so mr bush has ruled out this option second we can ignore north korea focus on iraq and hope that economic pressure brings the dear leader kim jong il to his senses that 's what washington is trying now but it 's not working in fact north korea 's economy is doing better than in the 1990 's and if it were pinched north korea could always raise cash by say selling smallpox virus to al qaeda and even if we succeeded in squeezing north korea economically we would be bothered much more than the dear leader as tens of thousands of koreans died of famine and disease third we can launch a military strike on the yongbyon reactor but north korea would probably respond by turning south korea and american bases there into what it describes as a sea of flames i think they would respond by shooting artillery toward south korea and missiles toward japan said kongdan oh author of an excellent book on north korea these are three terrible choices but a president 's job is to pick the least awful and hands down that 's the first one negotiation one way to hide our embarrassment at talking would be to get russia to convene an international conference in which the dear leader would give up his nukes and permit inspectors and outside countries would recognize north korea as robert gallucci a former ambassador with long experience in korea put it i do n't have any difficulty with diplomacy backed by force but what i do n't understand is force with no diplomacy ignoring north korea does n't work any better than ignoring a rambunctious toddler it just encourages further provocation next north korea may begin processing fuel rods at yongbyon a step that could give it five to eight more warheads in about four months granted there 's no good north korea policy but it 's still worth finding a better one like holding our nose and negotiating because north korea is already what iraq might become tomorrow e mail nicholas nytimescom
