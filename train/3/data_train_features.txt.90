 to the editor my main reaction to richard taruskin 's article on carl orff is one of sadness that once again a great deal of precious space has been wasted on academic overkill and though i happen to enjoy a bit of orff 's music on occasion i doubt he 's worth the column inches also annoying is the supposition that the music is somehow insidiously evil because of its beat and primal nature as i recall elvis was condemned for what he did with his hips jazz was once certain to send us to hell and assuredly rap will prove the downfall of western civilization thomas c white bogota nj
