 you do n't have to be familiar with the convoluted pop mythology behind the japanese anime film blood the last vampire to appreciate some aspects of a movie that seems destined for cult status anyone who desires to explore its world which is really a genre within a genre is advised to do a little homework but to an uninitiated film critic what 's most intriguing about the movie is n't its story but its digitally animated visual language which is determined more by technology than by content as deployed by the creators of blood the last vampire hiroyuki kitakubo directed from a concept by mamoru oshii digital animation is an extremely linear style that renders inanimate objects especially machines of all kinds with an astonishing precision the movie fetishizes its own technological prowess by lingering over images like jet planes moving behind chain fences that emphasize the mathematical minutiae of the digital universe at the same time the style tends to turn people into machines no matter how clearly drawn the characters may be once they start moving they turn into toylike figures proceeding in digital increments this brooding horror movie set in 1966 at the yakota air force base an american military compound in japan presents some of the most visually detailed characters ever seen in an animated film not aspiring to photo realism how detailed in the movie 's press kit one american filmmaker is quoted as comparing them to the figures in francis bacon paintings that statement may be wildly hyperbolic but the movie does sustain an ominous shadowy mood that is vaguely bacon like the craggy comic book line drawings of katsuya terada who designed the characters imagine a human population of icy technocrats with matching voices these figures are every bit as scary in their way as the league of vampires also known as chiropterans who have infiltrated the air force base these shape shifting monsters have the ability to assume human form and mingle in human society undetected they can also fly because the story is set on halloween the distinction between revelers dressed as vampires and the real thing becomes all the more tenuous the monsters nemesis saya youki kudoh is a grim unsmiling young woman of mysterious origin who wields a magic sword as she cuts a gory swath through much of the movie saya is accompanied by the terrified doctor saemi nakamura from the infirmary of the american school on the base all hell breaks loose after saya strides into the infirmary and attacks two vampires posing as students under treatment for anemia for my taste blood the last vampire which opens today at the village east is much more effective at evoking a paranoid mood than at telling a coherent story and the jerky action sequences are among the film 's weaker visual elements but then i have n't been immersed in the movie 's pop mythology that mythology developed by mr oshii as a novel a film and a video game is deliberately enigmatic and inconclusive according to her creator saya is n't a conventional heroine but an angry loner who loathes humans as much as she hates the monsters if saya 's world is a deeply sullen one some may still want to get lost in it as for me i 'll take a pass blood the last vampire directed by hiroyuki kitakubo written in english with some subtitled japanese by kenji kamiyama based on a story by kazuo yamazaki and mitsuhiro tougou and the original characters by katsuya terada character design mr terada music by yoshihiro ike animation director kazuchika kise art director yusuke takeda produced by spe visual works sony computer entertainment ig plus and ipa released by manga entertainment at the village east second avenue at 12th street east village running time 85 minutes this film is not rated with the voices of youki kudoh saya saemi nakamura infirmary doctor and joe romersa david
