 the european union is poised to drop its threat of rapid retaliation against united states tariffs on imported steel imposed in the spring senior officials said today the european commission the union 's executive body has drafted a recommendation that sanctions involving over 300 million of goods should be shelved until after a ruling by the world trade organization which is expected next year the europeans retreat on steel comes after the bush administration scaled back its proposed tariffs on steel imports exempting a further 178 steel products and largely defusing the dispute in march when the united states announced import tariffs of as much as 30 percent the european union was concerned that europe would be flooded by steel imports from other countries that had been priced out of the united states but this side effect has not been so dramatic a top commission official said today since march the bush administration has narrowed the product categories of steel that would be subject to the tariffs to the point where more than half the european steel exports to the united states are now exempt and steel prices have stabilized recently weakening the case for an immediate retaliation all these things together led us to the conclusion that sanctions are not necessary at the moment the commission official said but some diplomats representing the 15 member nations of the european union in brussels said the commission was backing away from unilateral sanctions because it would not get the majority support for rapid sanctions it needs from the member states the commission will present its recommendation to foreign ministers of the member state governments on monday the threat of sanctions has been enough to force the bush administration to water down its steel tariff regime said one diplomat who spoke only on the condition of anonymity why crank up the pressure now when the commission first considered sanctions against the united states it drew up a a list of products including citrus fruit textiles and steel products with the intention of hitting american industries in states that are important for the white house in next month 's congressional elections in addition to the exemptions already granted to european steel producers the bush administration has said it is considering reining in the tariffs even more united states officials have said that a new round of exemptions will be considered between november and next march
