 most people do not go to a party with thoughts of working but that is exactly what most of the 600 greater hartford jaycees do for more than seven days each june they are preparing the tournament players club at river highlands in cromwell for the canon greater hartford open professional golf tournament the professional golf association tournament starts on thursday but pre tournament events begin tomorrow these volunteers arrive at the golf course in the weeks leading up to the tournament for work parties as these sessions are called to put up fences organize the scoring system set up luxurious corporate sky boxes by putting up tents arrange and unpack furniture put oak paneled walls in place operate forklifts and attend to the many details of putting on a professional sporting event during the seven days of the tournament 2500 volunteers will work the event adding up to 4000 volunteer hours they will take care of the 35000 spectators who attend each day by working crowd control and handling parking and ticket taking duties but most of the organizational and set up work must be completed two weeks before the event begins during the seven work parties which last anywhere from three hours to all day the large warehouse on the club property that stores equipment such as the tables chairs the leader board and fencing was bustling with activity during one such work party on a hot sunday morning in june janet grace an underwriter for an insurance company and a member of the jaycees has been offering her services at the tournament for 18 years she coordinates the training and scheduling of volunteers the atmosphere here is always upbeat and energetic ms grace said as she unpacked equipment in the warehouse and i have made some of my closest friendships from the people i 've met here she said it is rewarding work you know that you 're helping to raise a lot of money for some really worthy causes terri sultar who sets up and runs the scoring system which among other things involves making sure they have the names of all the golfers in the tournament on scoring sheets and for the leader board said being a jaycee has another advantage after helping to run the gho she said you 're ready to step right into boards and other leadership position in other volunteer organizations like many volunteers cindy skiff in charge of selling setting up and running the corporate sky boxes uses vacation days seven this year from her sales and marketing job to work whole days before and during the tournament some of her duties also include recruiting volunteers who will serve as bartenders tent captains couriers and delivery crew since she will be working all seven days of the tournament ms skiff will in effect be donating more than 14 days worth of work to the tournament that translates into a significant financial contribution to the greater hartford open and the jaycees most of us on the executive committee use on average seven or eight of our vacation days during the june crunch time ms skiff said we just really enjoy the spirit of cooperation that fuels this event the jaycees are a national young persons volunteer community service organization whose mission is to develop leadership skills and raise money for community improvement programs such as scholarships for high school seniors in the greater hartford area and grants to the children 's fund members must be between 18 and 39 years old when they turn 40 members are aged out of the organization as the members put it but they can still volunteer to work during the tournament the greater hartford open has become the largest fund raising event for the jaycees who own the tournament and annually profit more than 600000 from playing host the detailed logistics of putting on such a sporting event usually require many full time professional staffers but the open is managed almost completely by jaycee volunteers each year a new tournament chairman or woman is selected by the organization 's management committee and that person oversees the 22 member executive committee which sets up and runs the tournament patrick mcnickle 33 is one of the tournament chairmen this year he began volunteering at the open in his teens and joined the jaycees after college he was eventually selected to be on the executive committee and last year he was chosen as assistant chairman he took over planning for this year 's event the day after the 1999 tournament was completed throughout the past year he has put in 70 hour work weeks between his network consulting job and duties as this year 's chairman mr mcnickle 's responsibilities include managing a 72 million dollar tournament budget touring the state to recruit volunteers and finding corporate sponsors the jaycees employ six paid staffers to help administer the tournament throughout the year and during the event itself dan baker 33 is one of the paid staffers who works on vendor and television contracts he serves as a chairman with mr mcnickle besides dealing with the day to day management of the tournament he is also the jaycees liaison with the pga and canon the tournament 's main sponsor he joined the staff after being the tournament director for last fall 's ryder cup matches in boston mr baker finds the hartford tournament unusual for how completely it is run by volunteers the very identity of the gho is the volunteer spirit he said taylor ives 23 is another paid staff member who is the operations manager for the tournament he works with the executive committee managing the army of volunteers for anyone interested in getting into sports management he could n't find a better training ground than the gho and that is because he would learn to appreciate how much can be accomplished by volunteers jim simeone an executive committee member in charge of grounds said he joined the jaycees after working the tournament for his company a beer distributing company that operates a vendor booth during the tournament he paused from his work of unloading crates of fencing with a forklift i was just so impressed by everyones energy and enthusiasm mr simeone said it never seems like work when you 're here everyone is willing to do any task at all to make this thing go smoothly tickets for the tournament may be purchased at the tournament players club each day of the event they are 20 and 12 for those 60 and older and for children under 17 children will be admitted free on monday and tuesday the number to call for information is 860 246 4446
