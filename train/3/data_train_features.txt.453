 martin brodeur dropped his black duffel bag on the wooden podium in the dressing room but instead it clunked onto his right foot he had been shrugging off questions about possible injuries to explain in part an unimpressive four goal night brodeur laughed joking that he was not sure how dropping the bag would affect him saturday in game 7 of the stanley cup finals in denver as usual he was light hearted but still understood the gravity of the situation the devils put themselves in by losing game 6 4 0 tonight it 's disappointing when you miss a chance to win you yourself put yourself in jeopardy of not winning at all brodeur said we put ourselves in position where we have two cracks at it so if we miss the opportunity hopefully we can take advantage of it the next time there is no other time brodeur stopped 14 of 18 shots and denied that a shot he took to the blocker pad from his teammate colin white in practice this morning had any effect on his play nothing serious he said no no i was fine he said he absorbed a hard shot to his right hip by defenseman rob blake in the second period and he was knocked on his shoulder on a 2 on 1 break later but brodeur offered few excuses or much in the way of an apology either they just got a few fortunate bounces a few that found the net and went in the devils captain scott stevens said marty will bounce back in the beginning brodeur had little to do but stay back in goal and admire his teammates crisp passes and their ferocious assault on patrick roy while roy was turning aside 12 shots nine from three power plays brodeur stopped the only three shots the avalanche had taken in the first 18 minutes two seconds later the avalanche had a 1 0 lead the first step to survival and the momentum whiplashed back to colorado defenseman adam foote had scored just three goals during the regular season but he scored his third goal of the playoffs when he pounced on a turnover from scott gomez carried just past the blue line and blasted a slap shot i lost it a little bit and it went off my pad brodeur said simply with that it seemed the game slipped from the devils at 6 minutes 59 seconds of the first period gomez had a goal disallowed when it was ruled he kicked the puck into the net after the devils failed on the power plays they lost their urgency all the power plays we missed early in the game made us break a rhythm about playing a hard nosed game brodeur said they were n't getting great chances but from there they got some bounces and controlled the game at the 2 26 mark in the second period the avs were on a power play with bobby holik in the penalty box for roughing foote fed martin skoula who wristed the puck from just inside the blue line and ville nieminen tipped it in past brodeur it looked like it was going wide but he tipped it and it went through my legs brodeur said it 's a hard situation when you get behind the eight ball and you try to recover and you make more mistakes and that 's what happened brodeur had suffered his worst night since game 1 the 5 0 drubbing even in that game he stopped 25 of 30 shots brodeur at times looked uncomfortable tonight after he let in the second goal brodeur made an easy save and the crowd cheered in mock admiration you ca n't blame him ken daneyko said we did n't get any goals to help him out brodeur had little chance on the third goal when chris drury rendered an artistic splicing and dicing of two defenders colin white and brian rafalski the fourth goal came with less than seven minutes remaining in the game the final ignominy alex tanguay rifled a slap shot two inches to the left of brodeur 's glove brodeur was a split second too late to make a stab but the game had already been decided during a a series in which only one goalie has played a near perfect game opposite the other round 6 went unanimously to roy he earned his record 19th career playoff shutout and his record tying fourth of these playoffs brodeur also has posted four shutouts this postseason but none in the finals brodeur earned his first star of the game of this postseason in game 5 when he turned aside 22 of 23 shots tonight however he blanched in comparison to roy his mentor every time one team gets momentum it looks like with the matchup it 's always one team going at one time and not both but i 'm sure that will change for game 7 we 'll both be fighting hard brodeur said
