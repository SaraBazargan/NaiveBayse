 a very californian thing has happened in the election campaign for governor of california former mayor richard riordan of los angeles the early favorite to win the republican nomination looks as if he might be upset in the primary election on tuesday by an inexperienced conservative who is believed to have little chance of winning in november some describe the election as a test of whether republican moderates can succeed in california politics as well as a test of whether president bush made the right choice in deciding to promote mr riordan 's candidacy actually it is a test of whether predictions are possible in california politics mr riordan must have looked like a sure winner to the white house which went out of its way last year to recruit him he surely thought of himself as a winner until recently he spent most of his time attacking the incumbent gray davis who is unpopular and is seen as having bungled energy and budget crises mr davis has also failed to erase the image of terrorism show off that he acquired when he warned of attacks on the state 's bridges even as federal officials called his fears uncorroborated among professionals mr davis is considered one of the country 's most prodigious fund raisers he has n't even given his enron money back he has already spent nearly 8 million for ads attacking mr riordan clearly hoping to influence republican primary voters the governor thinks he has a better chance of defeating mr riordan 's main opponent bill simon jr a wealthy conservative son of the former treasury secretary one ad quotes former gov george deukmejian a republican attacking mr riordan for alleged lack of character mr deukmejian still has not forgiven mr riordan for giving money to his democratic opponent years ago even for california the situation is bizarre a democratic governor paying for ads featuring attacks by a former republican governor on a republican candidate for governor on the ground that he gave money to democrats with mr riordan engaged in a last ditch fight handicapping the race is risky but already some people are saying that if he loses his biggest mistake will not turn out to be that he portrayed himself as a moderate rather it is that he snubbed his conservative base viewed the nomination as an entitlement and displayed only a casual knowledge of the state he also did not reckon on mr simon being a reasonably articulate vigorous and attractive candidate mr davis however could turn out to have made an even bigger mistake no sitting governor has ever tried so hard to influence a primary election in the opposing party since the 1960 's back then gov edmund g pat brown desperately wanted the gop to nominate the most conservative candidate so he attacked the moderate candidate relentlessly even before the primary sure enough the conservative ended up winning that race his name was ronald reagan he did rather well the following november and a few novembers after that
