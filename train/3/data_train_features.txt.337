 a regretful patrick ewing wished the knicks could have put more talent around him in his prime rather than his twilight he also fondly recalled the day he stood on the scorer 's table and lifted his arms high calling new york 's victory over indiana in the 1994 playoffs his greatest memory in some of the most candid moments of his 15 year career new york 's former franchise center spent almost 20 minutes today reminiscing about his days in orange and blue as the sonics worked out at the celtics practice facility preparing for their game at boston on monday night two days before an expected emotional return to madison square garden for the first time since he was traded last year to seattle ewing used equal parts reflection and humor to sum up his knick career it 'll be strange but i 'm going to do everything the way i 've always done it he said of his return i 've already told them i 'm driving my car up the ramp like i always did if the guards stop me i 'm running them over he joked about jeff van gundy 's penchant for running into the fray of on court fights about his former knick teammate mark jackson newly arrived back in new york boasting that he would dunk over ewing on tuesday but ewing also took time to voice fresh opinions on team business his most telling comment taking aim at a franchise he felt could have done more to win a title during his tenure there are some things i wish the knicks organization could have done to make the team better when i was younger than when i was older and hopefully we could have gotten a ring ewing said unprompted he also admitted approaching his agent david falk earlier in his career about trying to swing a deal with one or more of his clients to help the knicks win a title it never happened ewing said that 's life that 's in the past with the usual assortment of ice bags wrapped around his knees and wrists surrounded by replicas of the 16 championship banners won by boston ewing deftly bantered with a dozen reporters many flying in from new york to ask him about the feelings that will tug at him when his name is announced on tuesday night if i 'm going to cry is that what you want to know he asked no i hope not he added that he watched the knicks beat sacramento this afternoon that he still kept in close contact with van gundy and that the knicks would always have a special place in my heart nearly 20 years ago ewing sat at the podium of satch 's restaurant in downtown boston leaning awkwardly toward a microphone he announced the word georgetown and sat back and awaited the questions the inquiries then were about his immense talent and all the possibilities that could happen with ewing a 7 foot prodigy from the cambridge rindge and latin school in the middle of a defense two decades later he is slogging upcourt at 38 years old trying to siphon one more contract out of a team that will pay him when his current deal expires seattle is not expected to sign ewing again his minutes and role have been reduced with the sonics but he still believes he has much to offer the game time flies he said when asked to remember the day the knicks won the first draft lottery in 1985 and celebrated their good fortune it 's 16 years down the road but i 'm 16 years wiser i 've made mistakes in my life but if i had to do it all over again a lot of the thing i did i 'd do the same friends since they became teammates jackson and ewing have teased each other about his return on tuesday he told me he was going to dunk on me ewing said so i told him i was going to be waiting for him at the basket i would be awfully disappointed if it were anything but a standing ovation jackson said in new york earlier today anticipating ewing 's return he is nothing but a warrior and the greatest knick ever van gundy said the greatest knick to ever play is coming back for his first game he should be warmly received after that they 'll get on him just like every other visiting player asked to recall his best garden memory ewing said beating indiana to go to the finals i just remember being on the floor celebrating with everybody of the reception he is expecting tuesday he said i think they respect everything i 've done in my 15 year career in new york what do i expect i do n't know hopefully it 'll be a warm homecoming if not so be it
