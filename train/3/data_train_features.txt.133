 it is hard to imagine malaysia without mahathir mohamad prime minister for 22 years dr mahathir has become synonymous with his nation other than the weather little happens in malaysia beyond his control and some credit him with the rainfall but dr mahathir stepped down yesterday his final days in office were like his two decades of rule filled with controversy his scripted departure was marred by an anti semitic diatribe at an islamic leaders conference dr mahathir turned over power to a handpicked successor his earlier choice for heir is still imprisoned on false charges and left a nation that is prosperous but undemocratic corrupt and lacking the institutions necessary for enduring success when dr mahathir a doctor became prime minister in 1981 a quarter of all malaysians were poor today only one in 20 is poor per capita income has tripled after trying the nationalization of industry and heavy foreign investment dr mahathir isolated malaysia from the global financial markets during the asian crisis of 1997 the currency controls he imposed were widely criticized including by this page but appear to have kept malaysia 's economy stable as its neighbors collapsed dr mahathir a malay nationalist did relax affirmative action laws that favored ethnic malays over the prosperous ethnic chinese while he has avoided an islamic extremist threat he did so by rhetorically joining the extremists most recently dr mahathir made a poisonous speech in which he said that jews run the world by proxy comments that sadly drew applause from the organization of the islamic conference malaysia 's economic progress under dr mahathir may ultimately be undermined by his destructive legacy of personal allegiance in place of the rule of law there was virtually no check on his power and corruption and cronyism ran rampant his whims led the country into outlandish economic adventures like an attempt to corner the world market on tin his fearsome political police keep opponents in jail the courts the media and the universities are subservient in 1998 jealous of the popularity of his heir apparent deputy prime minister anwar ibrahim dr mahathir had mr anwar arrested on charges of abuse of power and sodomy after a politically orchestrated prosecution mr anwar was sentenced to 15 years it was disappointing but unsurprising that dr mahathir failed to do the right thing before he left office releasing mr anwar the new prime minister abdullah ahmad badawi has given no indication that he will change dr mahathir 's authoritarian style of rule but by freeing mr anwar he could right a tremendous injustice and signal that he at least can see that long term prosperity depends on real government and not the whims of one powerful man
