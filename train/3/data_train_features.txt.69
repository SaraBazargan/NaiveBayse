 i have to admit that of all the worthy and interesting movies opening this fall shattered glass was the one i was most looking forward to i also have to admit that the keenness of my anticipation made me a little suspicious of myself and of the movie which opens today in new york and los angeles the film written and directed by billy ray deals with the case of stephen glass a young writer and editor at the new republic who in the spring of 1998 was discovered to have fabricated in whole or in part more than two dozen articles he had published in that venerable journal of opinion as everyone discussing shattered glass is bound to observe there are obvious parallels between mr glass 's behavior and that of jayson blair the reporter who was found last spring to have invented or plagiarized portions of at least three dozen articles in the new york times but even if the memory of the blair scandal were not painfully fresh the earlier debacle would still exert a morbid fascination among journalists of a certain age and temperament the kind of people who spend way too much time surfing media gossip blogs and web sites and who are generally obsessed with tracking the behavior of the fish in the neighboring bowls those people i know a few of them are insular and self obsessed enough as it is and the last thing they oh all right we need is a movie that amplifies and feeds upon that narcissism shattered glass does that well enough at least i thought so but it is also i am happy to report much more than a knowing insidery docudrama about a magazine that has long prided itself on its inside the beltway knowingness the clinton era new republic is described several times with minimal irony as the in flight magazine of air force one the movie is a serious well observed examination of the practice of journalism and if it takes note of the vanity and obsessiveness that are among the vices of the profession it also acknowledges and perhaps romanticizes the hard work and idealism that are among its virtues but mr ray a screenwriter hart 's war making his debut as a director has grasped that the themes of this story ambition loyalty betrayal and deceit are not confined to journalism he has constructed an astute and surprisingly gripping drama not only about the ethics of magazine writing but also more generally about the subtle political and psychological dynamics of modern office culture glass played by hayden christensen is clearly motivated by a hunger for glory at work he is constantly receiving calls from important publications which he shrugs off with transparent false modesty are you talking to policy review someone asks him he replies with affected nonchalance it 's probably nothing but he also and perhaps more deeply has a desperate need for the esteem and affection of his colleagues his moments of greatest triumph seem to come not when the magazine publishes his fanciful articles about young republican debauchery at a washington hotel about a trade fair devoted to trinkets commemorating the clinton lewinsky scandal about a teenage hacker with an agent and a million dollar software contract but when he pitches them at editorial meetings working his audience like an anxious nightclub comedian he feeds on the laughter and amazement and his showboating is accompanied by displays of childlike insecurity i probably wo n't even do anything with it he says after rolling out one of his too good to be true story ideas waiting a beat for the praise and reassurance that are sure to follow are you mad at me he asks whenever someone raises even the smallest question about his work and of course no one ever is for a while at least glass 's eagerness to apologize for his small lapses deflects attention from his ever more extravagant lies mr christensen best known for his light saber work as the young anakin skywalker in the latest star wars episodes finds the perfect balance between creepiness and charm it is easy to see how the rest of the staff including the magazine 's beloved editor michael kelly hank azaria and a lightly fictionalized senior editor named caitlin chloe sevigny are taken in by glass 's brilliant little brother act midway through the film mr ray ingeniously and almost imperceptibly shifts the story 's center of gravity from glass to charles lane peter sarsgaard who took over after mr kelly 's abrupt dismissal and who brought glass 's journalistic felonies to light after an internet journalist named adam penenberg steve zahn began raising questions about the hacker article mr lane who now writes for the washington post is the hero of shattered glass and it should be noted that he also worked on the film as a paid consultant but mr sarsgaard 's performance is hardly a simple embodiment of nobility at the beginning lane seems cold and a little priggish aloof from the warm competitive camaraderie that binds the rest of the staff together as lane starts to investigate glass 's misdeeds he is suspected of pursuing a vendetta against writers loyal to kelly as we begin to see glass through lane 's eyes the film 's mood darkens and its pace accelerates what had started as a sharp workplace comedy becomes a clammy vertiginous psychological thriller the only false note comes near the end when the magazine 's moment of shame is rather too eagerly transformed into an occasion for self congratulation that lapse only underscores the movie 's overall meticulousness a more showily ambitious film might have tried to delve into glass 's personal history in search of an explanation for his behavior or to draw provocative connections between that behavior and the cultural and political climate of the times such a movie would also have been conventional facile and ultimately false mr ray knows better than to sensationalize a story about the dangers of sensationalism shattered glass is good enough to be true shattered glass is rated pg 13 parents strongly
