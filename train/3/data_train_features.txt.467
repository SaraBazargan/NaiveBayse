 new york philharmonic avery fisher hall with titles like ruhe meine seele peace my soul and wiegenlied lullaby the richard strauss songs that opened the philharmonic 's program on thursday night seemed a plea for a kind of respite that was not to be forthcoming for the songs performed by barbara bonney were followed by mahler 's weighty sixth symphony in which glimpses of pastoral romantic peace and strauss 's brand of sweet sentimentality are tempered by the fixity of an unblinking gaze beyond them into the void christoph eschenbach plunged into the program headlong sometimes to judge from sloppy entrances like the one that opened ruhe meine seele before the orchestra was fully ready there 's nothing ponderous about mr eschenbach 's mahler he whipped the symphony 's marches along with a tight raw energy and generally kept the bite in the piece from the sarcastic old fashioned passages in the scherzo which he invoked with an urbane touch of humor through to a bitter muffled end when the music closes as if stifled with a pillow the orchestra 's uneven performance was perhaps not entirely his fault the philharmonic can play wonderfully bringing off exposed passages like handoffs from one instrumental section to another then it turns around and gets sloppy with the horns or lurches through some of the dotted rhythms or goes muddy in big ensemble sections the overall effect was stirring but this sixth was a diamond in the rough ms bonney 's voice also evokes a diamond 's hardness with its smooth planes and angles and she too was rough in the strauss songs tinkering with the vowels of individual syllables working hard to create the right effect she 's at her best when she sings most simply and her own voice can come through coming through over a full orchestra was part of the problem and led to some of her manufactured exaggeration like overacting in ruhe meine seele to snarl the word wild with an artificial almost burlesque emphasis anne midgette
