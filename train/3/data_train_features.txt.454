 the political battle between gov george e pataki and tom golisano ratcheted up a few notches yesterday as a state court judge knocked one of mr golisano 's running mates off the ballot and mr golisano asked the manhattan district attorney to investigate mr pataki 's campaign for voter registration fraud mr golisano 's campaign had taken the unusual step of supporting two candidates for lieutenant governor on two minor party lines his choice for the independence party was william nield his conservative party selection was daniel f mahony jr the lieutenant governor mary o donohue filed suit in state supreme court in albany this month asking that the petitions to get both of mr golisano 's running mates on the ballot be invalidated because they were permeated with fraud yesterday justice thomas w keegan upheld mr nield 's right to be on the independence ballot but rejected mr mahony 's candidacy because he did not have enough valid signatures although mr golisano had said he would appeal an unfavorable decision in federal court experts say he would be unlikely to prevail at the same time yesterday mr golisano took the offensive against mr pataki by calling on the manhattan district attorney robert m morgenthau to investigate what he said was a systematic effort to stack the independence party rolls with nonexistent voters through the filing of fraudulent registrations joseph gentili the deputy director of the city 's board of elections said that since last thursday the board had received about 18000 new registrations mostly for the independence party of which 10 to 30 percent have had serious inconsistencies some as reported yesterday in the daily news and newsday were plainly bogus using names of notorious criminals or fictional characters mr pataki 's campaign as part of its efforts to register voters in the independence party had hired workers who were paid incentives based on the number of people registered a method mr pataki 's opponents say that by its nature would furnish ineligible or unreliable voters at a meeting of the board this week the democratic commissioners pressed to refer the matter to mr morgenthau 's office for a criminal investigation but the republican commissioners voted the idea down instead mr gentili said board workers will try to ferret out invalid registrations before proceeding
