 in one of the more brazen strikes at israel 's heart a palestinian man stepped out of a car today and sprayed automatic rifle fire outside the israeli defense ministry here wounding 10 people most of them soldiers on their lunch break the gunman described by a witness as so nonchalant that a cigarette dangled from his lips as he fired was shot in the head and killed by a traffic policeman as he tried to get away the incident came on yet another day of relentless lethal attacks and counterattacks that have made a mockery of a declared cease fire while offering no clear sense of where the long israeli palestinian conflict is headed once again senior figures on each side insisted that they wanted the violence to subside but once again the situation seemed to be steadily deteriorating with each side blaming the other and casting itself as the victim in the west bank tonight palestinians killed an israeli woman tehiya lomberg and wounded four other people as they drove near the settlement of alfe menashe earlier today the israeli army fired missiles at a car in the west bank city of tulkarm killing an islamic militant accused of anti israel terrorism near tulkarm soldiers also shot dead another palestinian said to have been planting a roadside bomb with an accomplice who escaped the missile strike was the third in less than a week part of israel 's pattern of singling out certain palestinians for death to palestinian leaders such attacks amount to a policy of state sponsored assassination but to israelis they are a legitimate form of self defense and they say all their targets including the one today were men who had helped carry out anti israel terrorist attacks or were about to israel 's prime minister ariel sharon made it plain today that he was not about to abandon the tactic i would n't have liked to kill anyone he said in an interview with the fox news channel every casualty is a tragedy but we have to avoid i would say massive tragedies and that 's the only way we can do it to drive home the point that they mean business israeli officials took a new tack tonight announcing on television the names of seven men who are on their wanted list for supposed involvement in terrorism past and present the point was clear they could be next on one level the tel aviv incident was far from the worst given that the only fatality was the gunman himself but the location and the nature of the attack set it apart from most others the defense ministry sits on a major thoroughfare kaplan street it is part of a military compound that also contains the headquarters of the army general staff although the compound is gated its courtyard is exposed to anyone shooting from the street and at noon kaplan street and the surrounding area tend to be filled with young israelis in uniform many of them unarmed on a lunch break from their desk jobs witnesses said the palestinian gunman identified as ali al julani of jerusalem drove up got out of his car and began firing dozens of rounds pvt claire hirschberg said she was walking and talking on a cell phone when she heard the shots i looked straight at him and he looked straight at me and he kept on shooting at me private hirschberg who was slightly wounded later told the israeli radio she continued i did n't get down on the ground because he was also shooting at people on the ground he stood there in complete nonchalance with a cigarette hanging from his mouth shooting at people and looking me straight in the eye the gunman tried to drive off but a few hundred yards away at one of tel aviv 's busiest intersection he was stopped by a traffic policeman who used his patrol car as a roadblock i ordered him to stop and he reached to pull out a gun said the officer ilan zamir i fired one shot in the air i ordered him to stop once again he did n't then i aimed at his head and fired three times struck in the head the gunman managed to drive another 30 yards or so before crashing into a utility pole police officers dragged him out of the car and put him on the ground he died later in a hospital israeli reporters who cover security matters said they had been told by officials that the gunman did not seem to have a history of hard core anti israel militancy it suggested they said that some of the radical palestinian groups have increasingly been forced to send out inexperienced gunmen because the israeli army has thinned their ranks of better trained people asked by a radio reporter if the incident today pointed to a change in palestinian abilities the israeli defense minister binyamin ben eliezer said you and many civilians are unaware of the fact that 85 percent of the terror attacks are being prevented you only hear of a fraction of them when a man or bombs are found the continuing violence has led yasir arafat and his palestinian authority to repeatedly call for a force of international observers to intervene in the conflict but in his television interview mr sharon repeated his opposition saying israel will not accept any international intervention here but the prime minister has also left open the possibility of a strengthened contingent of monitors mostly if not entirely from the united states who would keep track of events without necessarily being on the scene full time
