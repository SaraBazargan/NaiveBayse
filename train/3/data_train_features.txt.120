 to the editor there can be no doubt that the family members and loved ones of those killed on sept 11 have suffered greatly and will continue to do so for many years they deserve our sympathy and assistance but there is something unseemly about the machinations behind the victims compensation fund news article march 8 by guaranteeing victims families such huge sums the federal government is complicit in devaluing the deaths of other people families whose breadwinners are incapacitated by disabilities or terminal illnesses continue to suffer financially and emotionally and they can expect little or no help from government agencies instead of engendering continued good will from americans who broadly accept a reasonable level of government compensation the administration risks kindling resentment over deaths deemed somehow more special than others jeff hoover brooklyn march 8 2002
