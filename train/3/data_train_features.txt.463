 the boards of south african breweries and the philip morris companies met separately today to vote on an agreement that would allow south african breweries to buy two thirds of the miller brewing company for about 3 billion in stock people close to the companies said south african breweries is expected to announce the deal along with its full year financial results before the market opens in london on thursday these people said under the agreement south african breweries which has its headquarters here and whose shares are listed on the london stock exchange will also assume 2 billion in miller brewing debt the deal is the latest sign of the changes reshaping the global brewing business faced with stagnating beer consumption in the united states and western europe brewers have been acquiring rival companies in efforts to keep growing the recent consolidation has made giants of anheuser busch of st louis interbrew of belgium and heineken of the netherlands by contrast south african breweries the producer of castle lager and pilsner urquell has focused on the faster growing but riskier markets of africa china and eastern europe that strategy analysts said has left the company dangerously exposed to fluctuations in the value of the south african rand buying miller based in milwaukee would ease that problem analysts said while also giving south african breweries access to america one of the world 's biggest beer markets the acquisition would allow the company to leapfrog rivals including interbrew and heineken to become the second largest brewer behind anheuser busch it is currently the fifth largest worldwide for philip morris analysts said the deal will allow it to retain a stake in the combined company while focusing its resources on kraft foods and its tobacco businesses where the returns are likely to be higher philip morris 's influence in the merged company would include voting rights and the ability to nominate three nonexecutive directors the people close to the companies said philip morris would not be allowed to sell its roughly 34 percent stake for several years these people said john bowlin the chief executive of miller brewing and other top managers are expected to continue running miller the people said because the businesses do not overlap in any significant way job losses are expected to be minimal cost savings would be relatively modest these people said totaling perhaps 50 million to 75 million the global beer industry is undergoing such dramatic change that miller can no longer continue doing business as usual said thomas a russo a partner with gardner russo gardner a money management firm in lancaster pa that holds philip morris stock the deal gives sab global scale and access to the most profitable beer market in the world he said but it will be a clear challenge for them to try and improve miller in the face of anheuser busch indeed miller genuine draft and miller lite remain distant seconds to anheuser busch 's stable of brands including budweiser bud lite and michelob some analysts have questioned whether south african breweries with its lack of experience in the united states can succeed where a marketing powerhouse like philip morris has essentially failed at the least the company will gain a valuable distribution network it can use to bolster sales of its existing brands including pilsner urquell from the czech republic one of the few beers south african breweries exports to the united states it remains to be seen how miller will fare overseas if south african breweries decides to export the beer though it could be a refreshing change from some local brews like chibuku a kind of beer similar to a lumpy yogurt shake with alcohol that south african breweries sells in zambia and some nearby nations the deal represents a drastic shift for the company which was founded in 1895 to quench the thirst of gold and diamond miners it grew to dominate its home market but was locked out of international expansion in the apartheid years by the early 90 's when apartheid collapsed most markets in developed countries were saturated with competition the deal also closes a chapter for philip morris which has spent several years seeking a buyer for miller one of its weaker assets in a portfolio of brands that includes marlboro and maxwell house philip morris considered merging miller last year with south african breweries and britain 's largest brewer scottish and newcastle but the deal fell apart when scottish and newcastle balked at philip morris 's insistence that it retain a large stake philip morris and south african breweries began talking again earlier this year and the discussions turned serious toward the end of march j p morgan chase advised south african breweries dresdner kleinwort wasserstein and lehman brothers advised philip morris
