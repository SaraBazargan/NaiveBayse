 james e mcgreevey nearly ousted gov christie whitman a republican four years ago and now he is aiming to replace her successor acting gov donald difrancesco also a republican but at the moment mr mcgreevey is just the democratic mayor of woodbridge and as a sign of how much that means in state politics woodbridge is the latest undisputed winner of new jersey 's do n't dump on me sweepstakes the award is a brand spanking new all expense paid 45 million institution to house sex offenders who are deemed too dangerous to release from prison even after they have served their prison sentences everyone here is duly honored to be deemed worthy by not one but two governors of playing host to this group of fellow citizens less than a year after mr mcgreevey nearly beat governor whitman in 1997 his sprawling township emerged as the leading candidate for a new institution to house 300 sexual predators call them ingrates but woodbridge officials have been kicking and screaming for a couple of years now in public meetings and court documents saying they do n't want the sex offenders once mrs whitman left to join the bush administration mr mcgreevey asked acting governor difrancesco to review the decision last week the acting governor said there was no reason to change course mr mcgreevey politician that he is smells politics it 's pretty obvious he said in politics shipping 300 sex offenders to an opponent 's town is often viewed as a sign of disrespect i would expect jim mcgreevey to cry politics that 's what people running for office do said tom wilson a spokesman for mr difrancesco a person running for office in truth there 's some logic to selecting woodbridge there are already about 2500 prisoners in town divided between the east jersey state prison and the blandly named adult diagnostic and treatment center a special prison for sex offenders 650 of them these prisons are next to another center of state imposed punishment the rahway motor vehicle inspection station chris carden a spokesman for the department of corrections said the close proximity to the sex offenders prison will allow the new institution to use its resources and expertise as for the sex offenders they 're already there convicts who finish their sentences but are deemed unfit for release will simply move next door to the new institution this convenience of suburban incarceration is not a winning argument in woodbridge i think it 's an outrageous idea smack in the middle of a densely populated area said maria kocsis who lives near the state complex mr mcgreevey claims that the selection process was rigged to settle on woodbridge even though state officials say other places were considered mr mcgreevey honing his populist political rhetoric noted that none of new jersey 's wealthier suburbs were considered everything which is undesirable he said miraculously finds its way to the middle class neighborhoods that would mean woodbridge with nearly 100000 people in central new jersey woodbridge is the state 's sixth largest municipality aside from some pockets of big houses on wooded lots it is made up of mainly blue collar neighborhoods mr mcgreevey 43 is woodbridge 's omnipresent mayor the son of a trucking company salesman who got an ivy league education and made his way in local politics by working long hours and paying homage to party elders mr mcgreevey 's off the rack style seems to be reflected in the motto carried on main street banners woodbridge works woodbridge it seems also adjusts main street represents the forces at work in a middle class town polanka a polish american kitchen is a few doors from the carpet maven the building that once housed the woodbridge national bank is now auto parts of woodbridge residents are angry about the sex offender institution but they 're confident they will adjust to that as well unless of course mr mcgreevey is elected governor he says he would conduct a thorough review of the decision to put the institution in woodbridge it would all be based on facts not politics and he added it would be unlikely that woodbridge would be an appropriate selection
