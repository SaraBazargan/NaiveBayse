 october men reggie jackson george steinbrenner billy martin and the yankees miraculous finish in 1978 by roger kahn illustrated 382 pp orlando fla harcourt 25 the problem with most books that attempt to chronicle a baseball season is that they read like a whodunit after somebody has told you that the butler 's brother did it with slow acting poison because he was having an affair with the maid this subgenre of jocklit relies on the reader 's selective amnesia pages of manufactured suspense building up to a surprise ending already known to everyone with october men his account of the 1978 yankees roger kahn deftly avoids this common trap he knows that we know that the yankees will overcome all odds to catch the boston red sox and win the world series he takes advantage of our familiarity realizing that it gives him license to play with the story zooming in for a close up pulling back to show the big picture spinning hard against the conventional wisdom george steinbrenner al rosen billy martin and bob lemon this then was the foursome chained together at various times within the yankee command post a baseball equivalent of fort apache the bronx kahn writes each possessed star power and when they clashed significant portions of the cosmos seemed to shake that is one view anyway and the popular one a dissenting opinion goes like this after martin vaporized all you really had were three tough guys from cleveland trying to make it in new york kahn 's narrative follows the arc of this singular season but he does n't feel the need to stick too closely to the box scores with the self assurance of a master storyteller he veers off on a tangent about the reaction to the first female reporter appearing in the comiskey park press box what do you think this is ladies night at the turkish bath or a mini profile of the columnist dick young a kind of latter day aaron burr whose chosen weapons were sheets of yellow western union paper and a typewriter before returning to the pennant race if an anecdote ends with a great punch line that is reason enough to include it kahn recounts how lemon who managed the chicago white sox in 1978 before replacing martin in midseason complained to the umpires about the hailstorm of reggie bars being thrown onto the field by yankee fans after jackson hit a home run the stuff is slippery lemon deadpanned besides people are starving all over the world and we just had 30 billion calories laying all over the field october men also reveals the soft underbelly of the 1978 edition of the yankees taking us inside the clubhouse after the fearsome relief pitcher goose gossage made two consecutive errors to lose an early season game all but single handedly gossage wedged his large frame into his locker closed his eyes and began to cry kahn writes presently he rolled out of the locker onto the floor and curled into the fetal position his sobs carried through the clubhouse the core of the book is kahn 's portrayal of the team 's three alpha males the principal owner george steinbrenner the right fielder reggie jackson and the manager billy martin kahn goes beyond the easy stereotypes of these oh so public figures informing us that the blustering steinbrenner was in the williams college glee club with stephen sondheim i had a better voice steinbrenner volunteers and leaving us to decide whether or not steinbrenner was set up by richard nixon 's dirty tricks squad jackson is also shown as a man of many moods once provoking a fistfight with an oakland a 's teammate mike epstein over some free tickets then sidling up to him on the team plane saying it bothers me that you do n't like me while the portrait of martin is the least nuanced of the three kahn depicts him as a whitmanesque jumble of contradictions alfred manuel martin is sensitive and brash defiant and humble angry and soft voiced he writes he has not lived like a trappist monk but to picture him as an inveterate hell raiser completely surrounded by chorus girls comfortable only on ball fields and in saloons would be a considerable exercise in inaccuracy kahn sees baseball as a game of connections he is quick to point out the two degrees of separation between martin and casey stengel and john mcgraw john mcgraw 's great 1905 giant team despised him kahn writes i know that because christy mathewson told ring lardner who told his son john who told me though the team 's internal strife makes for great copy kahn is smart enough to emphasize that the bronx zoo yankees succeeded in spite of a dysfunctional clubhouse not because of it at the same time kahn understands that baseball does n't exist in a vacuum he weaves in references to the social and political events of the day arguing for example that new york 's newspaper strike was as important as red sox injuries in shaping this pennant race while most books about the yankees have been either hero worshiping or muckraking kahn 's perspective is refreshing while on some level the author of the boys of summer has to qualify as a yankee hater one can not love both the yankees and the brooklyn dodgers his enmity is well tempered he sees the yankees as an evil empire but it is an empire populated with good men who often rise above the team the yankees managed news in 1928 and 1953 as successfully as the yankees manage news and newspeople today kahn argues remarkably and uniquely 1978 comes down to us as the year in which yankee news management failed completely and a very rugged yankee baseball team did not not content merely to rehash the details of bucky dent 's home run october men instead sprawls like a great ballpark conversation encompassing the big and the small the old and the new the sacred and the profane kahn asks rhetorically what were these yankees anyway a big league team a commune an encounter group a street gang the answer of course is all of the above allen st john collaborated with christopher russo on the mad dog 100 the greatest sports arguments of all time
