 the arnold schwarzenegger bus tour made its final stop on sunday on the lawn of the state capitol addressing a crowd of 10000 mr schwarzenegger was upbeat and avoided comment on the headlines of recent days about women who said the actor had molested them or a book proposal that quoted him saying he admired hitler he did not refer to yellow journalism nor did any of his supporters here try to rally the crowd as one did on saturday to beat up reporters on sunday mr schwarzenegger drove the high road invoking the name of ronald reagan and his old line about the shining city on the hill still mr schwarzenegger did not totally escape discussion of the controversy in an interview with tom brokaw on the news program dateline nbc shown sunday night mr schwarzenegger was asked repeatedly about the accusations that he had made unsolicited advances toward women well first of all a lot of these are made up stories mr schwarzenegger said i never grabbed anyone that i pulled up their shirt and grabbed their breasts and stuff like that this is not me so there 's a lot of this stuff going on that is not true asked if he planned to be more specific about the charges mr schwarzenegger replied as soon as the campaign is over i will i can get into all of the specifics and find out what is really going on he said but right now i 'm just really occupied with the campaign as he has in recent days he talked about dirty politics especially if you become the front runner they 're going to throw everything that you 've done into the kitchen sink he said mr schwarzenegger who is leading in the polls for the recall election to replace gov gray davis on tuesday has been accused by 15 women in recent days of groping or sexual harassment there was an unusual amount of things about you know about women 's stuff that i did not expect it 's really like they 're coming out of nowhere all those things it 's you know painful in many ways because i know a lot of the stuff is not true he said though some democrats were game to make noise on sunday others were visibly glum it says a lot when mr schwarzenegger can draw more davis supporters to his events than mr davis can draw to his own the democrats continued to bring up the recent campaign controversies bob mulholland campaign adviser to the state democratic party was at the event on sunday morning and even he had to admire the turnout but not entirely he does n't draw as big a crowd as hitler did mr mulholland said tartly and so it went from beginning to end on mr schwarzenegger 's california comeback express tour no matter where he went questions about his past were there to meet him for most of the trip mr schwarzenegger was not asked about issues but rather about his character for instance not once on his trip through the san joaquin valley the breadbasket of california did mr schwarzenegger mention the word agriculture minute by minute day by day there was a new crisis the first day started with an article in the los angeles times with charges by six women of unwanted sexual advances mr schwarzenegger apologized at his kickoff rally in san diego yes it is true that i was on rowdy movie sets and i have done things that were not right which i thought then was playful mr schwarzenegger said he added i am sorry about that later that day mr schwarzenegger had to deal with a book proposal that said that mr schwarzenegger as a young bodybuilder had expressed admiration for hitler i always despised everything that hitler stands for he said i grew up with friends that were jewish and with people that were of the jewish religion i did n't think they were jewish because they were all blended in at times maria shriver was brought on stage to stand by her man she laid a moist kiss on his lips in fresno
