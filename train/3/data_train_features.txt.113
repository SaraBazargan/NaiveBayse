 earlier this fall i was on a flight to los angeles that made a few extra turns after takeoff once we reached cruising altitude the pilot made a long announcement explaining that his computer had been indicating a problem with the hydraulic brake system and that after running some tests he had decided it was ok that the problem was caused by a computer anomaly not the brakes so instead of returning to jfk we were cleared to fly on but then mr pilot added brightly i looked up and noticed we were ascending into the flight path of another plane so i dipped down to avoid it that was the second unusual movement you may have noticed actually no one had noticed from what i could tell though i was alarmed to hear about it why was our pilot telling us about questionable brakes and a computer on the fritz when we still had a landing to worry about five hours ahead clearly he was giving us way too much information he was guilty of overshare overshare is n't just a noun it 's also an accusation a way of calling foul in a culture in which people do n't know how to put the brakes on it 's carnie wilson in us weekly discussing the stomach and intestinal surgery that cut her weight by 150 pounds adding that after having her tummy tucked and boobs lifted she 's going to have sex all the time it 's unsolicited lectures from friends on colonics it 's a kid at the yankees parade holding up an i skipped school sign for a photographer overshare is woody harrelson talking about his tantric sex habits bob dole on erectile dysfunction jay leno questioning al gore about a rolling stone cover deemed too sexy and jim carrey telling details magazine that he could have a tumor on the side of my head and people would still be jealous it 's kathleen turner nude in the graduate in london and anything about the vagina monologues people are sharing without consideration of who they 're sharing with and whether or not they want to hear it said gordon wheeler a psychologist and the author of beyond individualism published this year by the analytic press ultimately i 'm not sure that real honesty is about telling the truth all the time it might be more of a way of unburdening yourself how did this happen was it the share your feelings ethos of the 1960 's the joy of sex woody allen jane fonda egging people into spandex calvin klein pushing male narcissism is it all a result of our tabloid culture or the fact that we constantly have to listen to strangers spill intimacies into cell phones should we blame reality television for empowering anybody at all to blubber and vent on camera and even if we are amused by sex and the city in which no act is taboo for discussion is n't it a textbook case of overshare extraordinaire some people benefit from oversharing when diana the princess of wales declared that there were three people in her marriage she was embraced for this indiscretion on the other hand i know liberal female hillary doubters who would trust her more if she had n't kept such a stiff upper lip during the white house sex scandal society is commonly too cheap henry david thoreau wrote it 's hard to disagree especially when paula jones increases her fame by posing for penthouse and a silly revue called naked boys singing which consists of just that is so popular that it 's being replicated in cities across the country even as we are bludgeoned with all this instances of dignity emerge the full monty on broadway for instance uses stripping to impart a lesson about personal exposure by way of some hard luck guys who flaunt their bodies because they have to not because they want to but ultimately the show charms because instead of sharing too much it keeps the brakes on instead of unburdening himself of his travails our pilot on that loopy flight should have kept his brakes on too at least the hydraulic brakes worked when we landed
