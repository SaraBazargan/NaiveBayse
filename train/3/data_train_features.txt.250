 vice president al gore today proposed expanding social security benefits for widows and parents who took time off from work to care for families asserting that the current rules had unfairly penalized women noting that the social security act was 65 years old mr gore also accused gov george w bush his likely republican opponent of proposing a risky tax cut scheme and other policies that would drain dollars from the retirement system and threaten its long term solvency george w bush seems to think that 65 years of the current social security system is more than enough mr gore said at an event before retirees echoing what is becoming a familiar attack line if he got his hands on america 's retirement system it would quickly become a system of social insecurity mr gore 's proposals would partly end what he called the motherhood penalty under which parents who stop working to raise their children see their retirement benefits slip they would also raise the benefits paid to widows by up to 50 percent the two plans which would raise annual benefits for 11 million people by 600 to 1000 each were considered modest but they gave mr gore an opportunity to praise what he called the magnificent social security system as well as honor women who rear children rather than work outside the home anybody who 's done it knows what hard work it is mr gore said of child rearing should we honor that work of course we should aides to mr gore said his proposals would be financed by the social security surplus now projected at 22 trillion in the coming decade but they would not estimate a cost beyond saying the plans would use less than 5 percent of the surplus or less than 100 billion over 10 years while mr gore courted women voters today his focus on social security also let him underscore what he considers the sharp differences between himself and mr bush on a core democratic program mr gore has called for using the social security surplus to shore up the system now projected to become insolvent by 2037 he contends that mr bush 's plan to cut taxes by 483 billion in five years would force the government to use the surplus to pay for other programs mr bush denies that the texas governor also proposes using the social security surplus to bolster the system unlike mr gore he would let payees invest part of their payroll taxes in stocks to raise returns today mr bush also campaigning in pennsylvania said mr gore had played down the system 's problems there needs to be social security reform to make sure there 's a social security system at all he said this is a system that i believe needs to be fixed social security benefits are based on the number of years a person is employed thus women who stay home for part of their work life to raise children tend to receive lower benefits than men upon retirement mr gore would credit stay at home parents men and women with 16500 in income for up to five years lifting benefits by an average of 600 a year for as many as eight million people his aides said for widows social security benefits are now cut by a third to a half of a couple 's combined benefits mr gore would lift a survivor 's benefits to 75 percent of the couple 's raising them an average of 1000 a year for as many as 3 million people according to his aides
