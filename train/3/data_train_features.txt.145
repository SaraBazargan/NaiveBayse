 the recruit which opens nationwide today takes place within the shadowy world of the central intelligence agency where we are repeatedly told nothing is what it seems this is true of the movie as well it seems like a spy thriller but it really is n't sure there are car and foot chases some gunplay a lot of breathless exposition and the frenetic uploading and downloading of files that is a staple of the modern high tech hollywood suspense film but for all of its slick manufactured suspense and a surprise twist that will come as a surprise to exactly no one this movie directed with shrugging professionalism by roger donaldson no way out 13 days belongs to a very special genre the al pacino crazy mentor picture examples include donnie brasco scent of a woman devil 's advocate and any given sunday in each of these movies mr pacino is paired with a younger actor johnny depp chris o'donnell keanu reeves jamie foxx to enact a peculiar generational battle whose outcome is usually a mutual learning of lessons often the temperamental contrast between the characters is reflected in approaches to acting mr pacino 's style the method gone mad is gestural and confrontational with a lot of shouting and muttering while his co stars adopt a cooler warier stance his roots are in the heat and dust of midcentury american realist theater theirs tend to be in the hip detachment of television and though these movies vary in quality and interest they share a lurching improvisational rhythm that makes them interesting to watch in the recruit mr pacino with jet black hair and a diabolical goatee shambles and blusters in his usual way turning the screenplay 's flavorless dialogue written by roger towne kurt wimmer and mitch glazer into mad poetry full of non sequiturs odd pauses and sudden barks and whispers it is almost worth the price of a ticket or at least of a video rental to hear him utter the words bethesda abu nidal and kurt vonnegut though not i 'm sad to say in the same sentence which would have been truly wonderful like christopher walken or marlon brando mr pacino frequently uses his gifts to make mediocre movies more interesting everything else in the recruit may be tiresomely predictable but he at least is not mr pacino is playing not that it really matters since his crazy mentor roles are best seen as episodes in a single continuing performance a man named walter burke whose job is to recruit and train operatives for the cia his protege is an mit graduate student named james clayton colin farrell who in addition to designing some kind of super powerful software application runs a web site devoted to his father an oil executive who died mysteriously in peru burke who has a scary eye for talent persuades james to come to the farm the agency 's top secret training facility a kind of hogwarts for spies there the young man develops a crush on a fellow recruit named layla bridget moynahan and endures a hall of mirrors initiation meant to test his mettle throw him off balance and provide the audience with a few jolts and reversals in anticipation of the main event which i wo n't give away beyond what the trailer has already spoiled nothing is what it seems there is a mole somewhere who could it be someone is betraying someone else guess who poor mr farrell spends his time in a caffeinated frenzy though layla is the habitual coffee drinker trying to maintain his leading man sang froid while registering panic stress and confusion he is without question a handsome and hardworking actor so hardworking it appears that he rarely has time to shave but his charisma and intensity have yet to generate a truly interesting performance some of the blame can no doubt be assigned to the material striving clumsy overdone pictures like tigerland and hart 's war but even as tom cruise 's apparent nemesis in the excellent minority report he seemed to be exerting himself to no clear purpose here for all his confident smirking anguished grimacing and brow furrowing torment his character remains a cipher you never really wonder or care about james 's motives or emotions mr pacino on the other hand is an exuberant riddle even though burke 's motives and emotions ultimately make no sense at all every time burke opens his mouth you wonder who on earth this guy is supposed to be and your realization that the character like the movie itself is incoherently conceived hardly matters it is both appalling and amusing to contemplate the cia as employing such a wing nut especially as a teacher of the young but really what mr pacino provides is an acting lesson one that mr farrell would do well to heed in an unimaginative by the book movie like this one the best thing an actor can do is dare to be strange
