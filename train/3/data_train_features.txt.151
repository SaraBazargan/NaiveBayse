 to the editor re push to move alaska 's capital has central theme juneau journal may 28 i 'd hate to think that randy phillips an alaska state senator is misrepresenting the ghost towniness of the capitol in juneau i 've visited all 50 state capitols though admittedly not all during business hours and i think it bears mentioning that a lot of statehouses seem to be devoid of bustle if mr phillips finds his workplace a tad moribund and out of the way then i 'd suggest he make a quick visit if such a thing were possible to bismarck or pierre rory evans new york may 29 2002
