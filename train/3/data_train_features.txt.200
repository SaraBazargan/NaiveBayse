 to the editor re restarting the mideast peace clock editorial june 29 yasir arafat 's apparent inability or unwillingness to enforce his will on every teenage stone thrower and every suicide bomber as well as israel 's frustration with his efforts underscores the inherent difficulties with the infirm peace process the oslo accords were meant to deal with a conflict between two peoples but in reality the palestinian people have never fully endorsed the concept of peaceful coexistence with the people of israel they continue to teach their children the rhetoric of hate and the glory of the jihad while their leader plays the diplomat in an attempt to turn world opinion against his partner in peace until the palestinian people and their leaders speak with a united voice of peace and cooperation the peace process will remain unrewarding for both sides eric jay wolf new york june 29 2001
