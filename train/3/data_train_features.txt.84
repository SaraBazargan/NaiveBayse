 two palestinian gunmen attacked this israeli settlement at the northern edge of the gaza strip on tuesday night killing a young couple and wounding 15 others in the boldest and deadliest assault on such a community in more than a decade after a three hour standoff the two gunmen were shot dead at about 11 pm tuesday by israeli sharpshooters the raid appeared calculated to destroy the already battered cease fire between israelis and palestinians it came a day after reports that the united states had been planning before the sept 11 attacks to introduce a vision of peace that included a palestinian state as the sun came up israeli tanks could be seen shelling palestinian controlled territory in gaza south of here in what appeared to be large scale operation bursts of machine gun fire sounded in the distance as tank treads sent up clouds of dust the house in which the gunmen made their last stand was pocked with bullet holes this morning the bodies still inside as some israeli soldiers looking exhausted left the settlement others were still detonating hand grenades that the attackers had left around the nearby houses a yellow robot was used to handle unexploded ordnance most of the settlers remained in their houses as the soldiers attended to the remaining grenades one settler avi fahrhan a pistol at his hip paused as left his settlement this morning to show a handful of spent ak 47 cartridges he had collected after the raid yasir arafat the palestinian leader condemned the attack and promised a quick and decisive limit to any breaches of the cease fire but in a speech while the firefight was still under way ariel sharon the israeli prime minister ridiculed the notion that mr arafat had abided by the truce everyone is happy arafat declared a cease fire mr sharon said in a speech tuesday evening but the fire did not stop for one minute not for one minute mr sharon faces pressure inside israel to respond to the attack swiftly and decisively and from the united states to show restraint as the bush administration tries to put together a coalition that includes arab nations to fight islamic terrorists on tuesday night under a full moon the gunmen had found their way past the fence surrounding the settlement on at the edge of the mediterranean sea they shot the young couple a young woman from the settlement liron harpaz 19 and her boyfriend assaf itzhaki 21 who was from a nearby city then burst into several houses hurling grenades and firing kalashnikovs settlers barricaded themselves in their homes as the relatively small patrol of israeli soldiers guarding the settlement tried to repel the attack antiterror squads in unmarked vans raced to the scene merging with a steady stream of jeeps armored trucks and ambulances entering the settlement the soldiers feared that the gunmen had taken hostages in at least one of the houses but when the shooting stopped it appeared they had not concerned that there might be a third gunman soldiers searched the area with dogs but turned up no one of the wounded seven were soldiers and eight were civilians one of the injured soldiers was said to be in serious condition but the rest had slight to moderate injuries the militant group hamas which scorned the cease fire claimed responsibility for the attack it described the raid in a statement released in gaza in which it said zionist security was soft and weak gen derom almog of the israeli southern command said that his intelligence sources confirmed that hamas was behind the assault both men were in uniform he said and one man wore a hamas bandana but in an interview at his command post this morning general almog accused mr arafat of encouraging such violence from one side arafat continues speaking of cease fire but from the other side in his own language he is speaking about continuation of intifada he said this is a strategy of doubletalk mali halim a resident of the neighboring settlement of dugit wept tonight as she described the couple who were killed friends she said of her children it 's not like living in town she said of life in the settlements it 's one family settlements are among the sorest of points between israelis and palestinians who consider them colonial outposts illegal under international law some settlements particularly those in the heart of the gaza strip and near palestinian villages in the west bank are heavily fortified and a few of them now can be reached safely only by armored vehicle but alei sinai which plans to celebrate its 18th anniversary on thursday was seen as a more established less intrusive settlement at the margin of palestinian land as a result it was not as heavily defended and it apparently made an easier target mrs halim said that alei sinai and her settlement of dugit had asked repeatedly to have their fences electrified but that the government refused to cover the expense while the settlement had not been attacked before the sound of gunfire was so familiar that mrs halim did not think much of it as she left for work this evening we wake up with shooting and go to sleep with shooting she said it 's routine we 're under siege mr arafat was said by advisers to be very angry over the attack in a statement he promised appropriate measures from the palestinian side to secure the respect for the cease fire and to put a quick and decisive end to any violations from our side earlier in the day mr arafat took one step that the israelis had been demanding of him he arrested atef abayat a leading palestinian militant in bethlehem whom israeli security officials accused of involvement in the drive by killing two weeks ago of an israeli settler sarit omrani members of mr arafat 's own faction fatah strongly protested the arrest as politically motivated calling mr abayat innocent under the terms of their cease fire the israelis were to begin easing restrictions last friday on palestinian areas in exchange for a crackdown by palestinians on militants but progress under the agreement was grudging fighting in recent days had left at least 19 palestinians dead and more than 200 wounded a car bomb that exploded monday morning on a jerusalem street further strained the cease fire in washington on tuesday mr bush called the creation of a palestinian state part of the long term vision for peace in the region mr sharon has made at least a rhetorical gesture toward the same goal but israeli officials are alarmed by a perceived tilt in washington at least at the state department toward the palestinian cause since the attacks on the united states
