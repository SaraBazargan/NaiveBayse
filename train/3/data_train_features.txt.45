 my dad never went to high school his father a lumberjack in stillwater minn died going through the ice with a team of horses dad was in the eighth grade at the time and went to work as the third cook and dishwasher at a lumber camp the men slept on straw in wooden bunks and every friday dad emptied the straw and burned it it was full of lice and then hosed off the bunks it was a hard life eventually he got a job at a power company as a timekeeper and worked his way up to the cashier department he was smart a voracious reader but it was no position to speak of he ended up with a passion for educating his children he kept telling us you 've got to get some degrees behind you the passion grew as he got older once a week he sat next to a tax and business attorney on the streetcar on his way to work he 'd come home and talk about how wonderful the guy 's job was what i did n't realize was that he was recruiting me to be a lawyer when i went to the university of minnesota i knew two things i wanted to be a lawyer and i needed to play professional football to earn the money to go to law school i played football at minnesota i think eight guys on the team went on to law school i figure they thought if that dumb sob can do it so can i i started law school in my fourth year at minnesota i showed up a week later than everybody else and i did n't have a clue what they were talking about in class i got so confused that when i went to football practice i could n't remember my locker number or combination i ran scared as hell for the first semester but i saw later that some of the most articulate kids in class never made it to the second year i played pro football in canada under bud grant my nickname was mcgoo i had very bad vision under the lights and was always squinting if i saw something with a different color i knocked it down the day i graduated from law school dad said one congratulations and two now you got ta figure out a way to go to harvard business school i said no way i worked for a law firm for a time when i was offered a job at supervalu as senior vice president dad was the most unhappy guy in the world he wanted me to practice law even after i became president he still would n't accept it what 's it like running the country 's biggest grocery wholesaler my kids will ask me how do you do it it 's a little like football practice you 're banging your head and banging your head if you stopped and thought about it you might not do it but football also taught me not to take myself too seriously here everybody from top management to the cleaning staff calls me mike we work hard at fighting egos i go grocery shopping about once a week at one of our own retail stores or one that is run by a distribution customer i concentrate on the perishable areas does it look fresh how clean is it are the employees friendly i 'm probably more intense than the average shopper there 's never a dull moment in this business i believe that 10 years from now a meter in your shopping cart will record the price of each item you put in and the total bill and you 'll be able to leave through an electronic gate without waiting in line people like to shop but they hate waiting in line i was the 1999 recipient of the horatio alger award coming from my background i could n't agree more with the philosophy of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps the key for young people is education when i see kids dropping out of school it breaks my heart
