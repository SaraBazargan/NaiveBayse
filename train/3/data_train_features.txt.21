 the united nations oil for food program in iraq has little prospect of releasing even 1 billion of its approximately 14 billion for emergency food and medical aid before its authorization runs out on may 12 the program 's director said in an interview today and while benon sevan director of the office of iraq program hopes to persuade the security council to extend the program 's emergency authorization until june 3 he said its complexities and the political debates whirling around it made it unlikely that its outlays would reach 10 percent of the funds available even with the time extension the program 's future has been in limbo since last week when president bush called for an end to united nations sanctions against iraq because the oil for food program was created to ease the burden of sanctions on ordinary iraqis ending the sanctions effectively means ending the program that controls most of the iraqi economy the iraqi government did the contracting for the program offering billions of dollars worth of business to companies from countries with which it wanted to trade in the seven years since the program began one security council diplomat said today russian companies did twice as much business as any other country 's firms 73 billion in oil purchases and the sale of other goods since 1996 other leading trading partners were egypt at 43 billion and france at 37 billion jordan the united arab emirates and china each did more than 3 billion in business through the program the diplomat said the idea of cutting off the russian and french contracts has wide appeal in republican circles in washington where those countries opposition to the war is remembered bitterly but little has been said about the implications of doing the same to egypt and jordan two of the countries the united states has worked most closely with in the middle east in an interview today mr sevan turned away all questions about specific countries and specific contracts i do n't look at contracts in terms of countries of origin he said i look at the contracts in terms of what is required he added if we start going to a determination if something is good or bad by country of origin we are playing politics and i do n't want to be part of it part of the delay in expediting emergency food and medical supplies to iraq mr sevan said stemmed from 10 days of procedural haggling among security council representatives on the program 's oversight committee more time was taken determining what aid was already on its way and what would be needed as i said yesterday mr sevan said my hands are tied and my legs are tied and i 'm being asked to serve a seven course dinner that 's the problem to unravel the web of contracts approved by a security council committee that included representatives from the united states and the united kingdom could take months mr sevan indicated currently the escrow account for the program contains 103 billion earmarked for goods like health related equipment 437 million electrical equipment 13 billion water and sanitation equipment 513 million and spare parts for oil production 2 billion an additional 6 billion of contracts have been approved but until the oil starts flowing again no revenue will come in to pay for them and it is unclear who will be in charge of the oil sales when they resume even the 85 million barrels of iraqi oil at the turkish port of ceyhan can not be sold mr sevan said because there is no legally sanctioned owner to sell it mr sevan is to discuss these issues at a closed security council session on tuesday afternoon he will appear a few hours after hans blix a chief weapons inspector talks to the council about his group 's readiness to return to iraq the debate over what role the united nations will play in the new iraq has brought the oil for food program into prominence it has also revived longstanding criticisms over items like its administrative budget paid for from a 22 percent share of all the oil sold under the program which has totaled more than 1 billion under united nations supervision designed to keep iraq from importing the raw materials for unconventional weapons iraq 's former government sold up to 22 million barrels of oil daily and purchased goods ranging from electrical generators to spare parts for oil field equipment to the basic food rations for 60 percent of the iraqi populace
