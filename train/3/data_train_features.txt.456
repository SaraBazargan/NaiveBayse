debris splashed down like belly flopping fish something 's down there mr harper said i can feel it over the last five days the town of hemphill population 1106 has been transformed into a bustling anxious depot of space shuttle debris and the center of a big mystery the hope that a significant clue to the columbia disaster is lying on the bottom of the reservoir here or in the nearby brush has drawn more than more than 500 military personnel to this woodsy outpost a few miles from the louisiana border that is the largest concentration of resources in any debris zone the nose cone and parts of the landing gear were found in hemphill 's forests along with many human remains and residents said they saw objects as big as cars plunge into the reservoir a few days ago searchers in army helicopters spotted several large pieces of wreckage shining on the bottom then the rains came and flooded the 65 mile long reservoir that straddles the texas louisiana border and turned already silty waters into chocolatey darkness we ca n't see much said marq webb an official with the united states forest service sonar readings tell us something is on the bottom but we have n't found it yet maybe it is the cabin the tailfin crucial chunks of the left wing locals have their own theories which they swap at places like fat fred 's home of the 315 steak sandwich it had to be something major to send a plume of water shooting into the sky said jim schneider who also lives along toledo bend those nasa guys will find it they got all that fancy equipment hemphill residents have welcomed the newcomers like long lost cousins more than 200 families have opened their homes to the scientists state troopers soldiers and volunteers who now outnumber the local population george ann ferguson woke

southwest ms ferguson promptly took him in brought out a tray of biscuits and gave mr davis a warm place to sleep before the grueling search through the thorny woods the next morning today a platoon of national guard soldiers walked shoulder to shoulder through the slanting rain dozens of humvees and camouflaged transport trucks lined the roads it looked like a military drill or a war meanwhile in stoplight free downtown hemphill nasa scientists catalogued recent finds including several tiles strips of seared titanium and a spaceship window with glass still in it some of the heavier stuff landed there said a nasa spokesman doug peterson now we want to find everything the rain and chilly weather have complicated things the blackhawk helicopters that were used to scan the waters and the woods have been grounded the divers beached the shifts shortened the crews out there are cold wet and miserable said mr webb the forest service officer who spends his days in a damp muddy trailer yesterday texas authorities announced that they were granting a temporary amnesty to give anyone who plundered space shuttle debris a chance to bring it back this came after two people were arrested in nearby nacogdoches and charged with stealing government property for reportedly walking off with shuttle fragments federal agents have repeatedly warned people not to pick up any of the thousands of pieces that rained down on them on saturday in nacogdoches county officials announced today that 17 people had come forward with shuttle fragments that they had taken here and across east texas officials are searching especially hard for a device that handled communications between the shuttle and earth instructions given to the search teams showed a box marked secret government property the debris zone continues to widen residents of seven counties west of dallas are now being asked to look for shuttle material and report its locations to the authorities thousands of pieces have been retrieved including the nose cone sections of the fuselage seats harnesses clothes a shoe windows a rocket engine fuel tanks and countless strips of scorched metal remains from all seven astronauts killed on board the columbia have been identified yet after more than five days crucial objects like data recorders and wing pieces were still missing we do not have any red tag items ron d dittemore the shuttle program manager said in hemphill it seems as if like the whole town is involved in the debris hunt one way or the other the vfw has been turned into a feeding hall lined with chips volumes of water chili dogs and cake this is where volunteers meet before they stomp off into the soggy woods don iles the city manager explained we see it as our job to make sure no one leaves saying they were treated wrong in hemphill texas mr iles said the fire station is the command center men in ponchos guard the door you looked good on tv last night one woman driving a buick yelled to one of the sentinels outside nowhere is the activity more focused than around toledo bend the largest manmade body of water in the south an angler 's paradise it covers 185000 acres and it reaches 100 feet deep according to nasa scientists the shuttle ripped apart right over the reservoir earlier in the week when the weather was good police boats plied the waters looking for debris with sonar and an underwater camera though 625 pieces of debris have been found in the woods around hemphill not a single one was found in the reservoir mr harper a retired oil worker is not hopeful pure muck he said of the bottom you throw an engine block down there and you 'll never see it and then there are the alligators though it is a little cold for them they are still out there mr harper said many of
