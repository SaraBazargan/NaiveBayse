 for the nation 's most feared islamic militant no glory was waiting at the end of the road he was killed in a late night shootout in this dusty farm village in the blistering plains of south punjab in his 36 years the militant riaz basra the head of the dreaded sunni extremist group lashkar i jangvi had led a life brimming with murderous action along with a legend of miraculous escapes his activities ranged from a bombing attack against former prime minister nawaz sharif three years ago and the murder of an iranian diplomat in 1990 to multiple jailbreaks and exile he eventually gained the leadership of a terrorist training camp in afghanistan in alliance with the taliban and fought with the anti soviet mujahedeen in between there were the killings of hundreds of doctors policemen and lawyers from his country 's shiite muslim minority and a notorious lahore cemetery massacre of 1998 in which 25 shiite mourners were gunned down and 50 injured as they recited the koran he sprinkled his resume with numerous bank robberies like the bandit queen of india mr basra 's career even included a run for political office in 1989 when he sought election to the regional assembly of lahore but lost a simple villager armed with a 22 caliber rifle and a few neighbors with old pump action rifles and handguns brought down mr basra the villager fida hussain ghalvi was on guard on top of his house on tuesday as he said he was every night since mr basra 's group killed his brother in 1997 he stood guard because he feared that mr basra 's rogues would come back to stop him from testifying in murder cases involving his brother and others on this night the terrorist leader and three comrades approached his home at 3 30 am with ak 47 rifles and rockets launchers mr ghalvi 44 said mr ghalvi a soft spoken father of three said he had no idea the attackers included mr basra although he knew immediately that it was the lashkar group it had come for him several times in the past killing over 20 villagers here they pulled up to the house in a suzuki and when a guy got out and i asked him who he was they opened fire with kalashnikovs mr ghalvi said i returned the fire from my rooftop and soon many of the neighbors were firing too two of the terrorists fell in the street and two others broke into my compound by the grace of god they died in the exact spot they had slaughtered people here several years ago as he spoke he was surrounded by visitors who had come to his house to congratulate him they met in a living room decorated with islamic art and photographs mr ghalvi 's story generally corresponds to the official version of events a half hour after the shooting began a heavily armed special police brigade arrived and finished off the surviving assailants the authorities say the body was positively identified the next day and relatives turned out for a funeral today that drew 3000 mourners to his native village in sargodha the news of mr basra 's death was slow to sink in here because the police have claimed to have killed him many times before only to reveal later that they had shot the wrong man in a typical expression of doubt one newspaper carried a totally straight report of the fatal shootout under the headline basra killed again we have heard many times before that he is dead but our hearts do n't believe it yet said asim nadeen a shopkeeper who sells spices biscuits and tea in a small town nearby people say he was a real goon but only god can judge him the death of mr basra is a reminder that in this part of the world terrorism is not limited to osama bin laden pakistan and its neighbors crawl with groups like mr basra 's lashkar i jangvi but they have usually reserved their wrath for fellow muslims and have not become well known in the west but since the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon the united states has urged pakistan to rein in militant islamic groups it has done so with mixed results as terror has continued against americans including the reporter daniel pearl the 11 french citizens killed by a car bomb in karachi and the continuing violence in kashmir an attack on an indian army camp there this week killed 34 but many pakistanis say it is pakistan 's own intelligence services that have been the most important sponsors of fanaticism this all began when president zia was facing a challenge from civilian political groups said rashid ahmad khan a former dean of political science at punjab university referring to the former president mohammad zia ul haq in order to reduce their influence he decided to split the country along ethnic and sectarian lines and began sponsoring these groups many of them were sent to training camps in afghanistan and when they came back it was to sow terror and sabotage in pakistan sardar nur ahmad khan a lawyer and former president of the regional bar said poor men like riaz basra are recruited from the religious schools and turned into terrorists and the result is panic for all of us for mr ghalvi the killing of mr basra has only increased his turmoil i ca n't even go outside he said they will come again because i have killed their leader but i do n't regret avenging my brother in fact i thank god that he made me an instrument for such a deed
