 the first time i tried to order an alberto no 1 at la caravelle alberto would n't let me i was sitting at the small bar in the back room where adalberto alonso alberto for short has been bartender for 38 years not a bad tenure considering the restaurant just celebrated its 40th birthday after two glasses of champagne i asked if he had a house specialty he described the ingredients vodka champagne lime juice sugar and mint leaves then politely suggested that even though i had already consumed several pounds of bar nuts it might put me over the top fortunately my girlfriend arrived i ordered her one immediately and guzzled as much of it as she would allow you can not drink two of them mr alonso says as a rule of his deceptively light concoction the trouble is you desperately want to the vodka cuts the sugar and makes a clean delivery system for the mint and lime imagine a mojito but drier and with an elegant uptown fizz mr alonso who is 62 came to the united states from cuba when he was 17 his first job was at l'aiglon across the street from the st regis before moving to la caravelle he invented the no 1 about 30 years ago and quit while he was ahead there is no no 2 a new york adaptation of the mojito the cuban national cocktail it has the same base of lime sugar and crushed mint leaves but instead of rum it is shaken with vodka and topped with dry champagne it has a new york price too 12 the shaking is something to see not an insubstantial man mr alonso almost fills the small space behind the bar but when he brings the shaker to ear level and moves it rhythmically behind his head he suddenly takes on the lithe grace of a mambo king the no 1 is then poured into in an hourglass shaped goblet i associate with that other great pre castro cocktail the daiquiri sipping it i imagined myself at el floridita regaling papa hemingway with tales of the marlin that got away but was brought back to reality by the sight of michael douglas there he was in a french blue shirt unbuttoned to perfection inspecting an empty banquet table by the bar making sure all was in order for some big birthday party for some reason i was not invited on my next visit to observe more closely mr alonso 's ministrations andre jammet who owns la caravelle with his wife rita came over brandishing what looked like an enormous burgundy glass he asked if i would prefer to sip from this more elegant vessel i declined on the ground that it would mean either too much glass or too much drink there were three of us and we were thirsty in lieu of a second round mr alonso topped up our glasses with champagne by this time one of my dates was calling the drink alberto vo5 because it has the same hold mr alonso told us that he has an identical twin brother jorge who is the bartender at anche vivolo on 58th street you see him you see me he said i tried to imagine the confusion this must have caused in the old days back when jorge worked at le pavillon across the street where michael 's is now i pictured all those larry tate types on fat expense accounts taking their secretaries to this gold coast block and seeing the same face behind two different bars more than one no 1 and you 'll be seeing double without even leaving your stool alberto no 1 adapted from adalberto alonso la caravelle time 5 minutes juice of 1 lime 2 ounces vodka 10 mint leaves rinsed 1 1 2 teaspoons extra fine bar sugar champagne mint sprig for garnish in a cocktail shaker combine lime juice and vodka add mint leaves and crush with a spoon add the sugar and a little ice shake vigorously and pour into a tall stemmed glass add champagne to fill garnish with a mint sprig if desired yield 1 drink
