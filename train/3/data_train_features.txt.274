 following syria 's vote for the security council 's resolution demanding new weapons inspections in iraq the arab league voted sunday to urge iraq to comply with the american sponsored resolution on tuesday the six persian gulf arab monarchies in the gulf cooperation council likewise urged iraq to cooperate yesterday iraq indicated that it would comply with the resolution all that arab support for the security council must have hurt saddam hussein for he is the self appointed champion of the arab cause his basic assumption is that there is a single arab nation stretching from the atlantic to the indian ocean at different times history chooses part of this mythical nation to assume leadership in saddam hussein 's view it is now iraq 's turn this dream of power is not only problematic for iraq 's neighbors and fellow arabs it is problematic within iraq as early as 1969 saddam hussein spoke of his determination to strengthen iraq 's uruba arabness this was no easy task although all the people of iraq do feel that they are iraqis not all regard themselves as arabs historically only part of the 7000 year biography of the land that is iraq could be described as arab the rest is covered by sumerian assyrian akkadian babylonian elamite urartan persian byzantine mongol mamluk and ottoman periods among others iraqi architecture music cuisine and daily rituals reflect this rich diversity the word iraq is persian meaning lowlands as is baghdad which means god given the names of iraq 's two great rivers the euphrates and the tigris are greek iraq is also the home of 11 living languages some of which like elamite are twice as old as arabic as much as 25 percent of the population are ethnic kurds speaking two languages surani and bahdinani and following a variety of religions including zoroastrianism then there are assyrians chaldeans armenians nestorians and sabeans most of them christians and turkmen who are muslims arabic is the mother tongue of some 68 percent of the population providing a strong linguistic bond but the ethnic arabs are divided between shiite and sunni muslims saddam hussein does not tolerate hyphenated identities under him no one can be kurdish iraqi or sabean iraqi you have to be arab his problem has been how to arabize iraq in 1970 he opened the ottoman archives in which iraqis were classified as either ottoman or persian subjects he prepared a policy of mass expulsion against the persians even though many prominent iraqis including rashid ali al gailani the father of iraqi nationalism and muhammad al jawahiri the greatest arabic poet of the 20th century had been classified as persian during ottoman rule the mass expulsion of the persians was implemented from 1972 on by 1980 nearly a million people had been driven out needless to say the overwhelming majority of those expelled had been born and raised in iraq regarded themselves as iraqis and spoke arabic as their mother tongue to replace them saddam hussein decided to import a million arabs especially from egypt very soon however he decided that the egyptians were lazy and cared too little about his dreams of empire and conquest in 1980 he decided to arabize the kurds over the next 10 years more than 4000 kurdish villages in the north of the country were razed their inhabitants transferred to southern iraq and scattered among the arabic speaking majority for saddam hussein this was a double coup because the transplanted kurds were sunni while the arabs among whom they would live were shiite a religious group disfavored by mr hussein 's regime under his vision iraq must be fully arabized by force and if necessary through genocide he also wants iraq to secure control of the principal source of arab wealth oil that means either the direct conquest of the persian gulf states or their indirect domination he has shown that he is fully prepared to go to war to fulfill this vision and has done so on four occasions since 1968 his quest for weapons of mass destruction is simply one strategy by which he hopes to dominate the region there are times in history when the leadership of a nation is small saddam hussein said in a speech in 1977 there are other times when the nation is smaller than the leadership a great nation with a small leadership gets nowhere but a great leadership can drag a small nation along to greatness saddam hussein has dragged the people of iraq and to some extent the rest of the arabs into several tragic adventures in the past three decades soon he may drag them into yet another one that may be his last amir taheri is editor of the paris based journal politique internationale
