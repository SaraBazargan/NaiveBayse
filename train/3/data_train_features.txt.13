 running alongside the gurney that is taking her husband to surgery nancy reagan leans over as she clutches a jar of his favorite candy i brought your jelly beans darling she says every action in the simplistic film the day reagan was shot is so clumsily telegraphed that even the jelly beans eventually get their close up as the fictional nancy waits for word from the operating room she sits alone and watches the career shattering news conference in which secretary of state alexander m haig jr announces in a voice so quavering it could only inspire fear i am in control here at the white house she is so appalled she literally spills the beans and the camera focuses on brightly colored candies scattering on the floor around her black pumps that might have been a nice comic touch if the film were a satire but it 's not despite some halfhearted attempts at wit the day reagan was shot is an earnest look at what happened when john w hinckley jr tried to assassinate ronald reagan in march 1981 and if the jelly bean close up seems an odd choice an even stranger decision surrounds the movie why would showtime sandwich this limp re creation between two documentaries about the events the nonfiction programs only highlight the film 's lack of drama and the entire package suggests how difficult it is for a fictional version of recent history to stand beside events that have already been captured by news cameras replayed for years and beaten flat in memoirs recreating history is not the problem here oliver stone an executive producer of this film has built a career on it he was more effective in nixon than in j f k but whatever you think of his interpretations he knows how to use the freedom that fiction offers creating gripping movies and provoking ideas cyrus nowrasteh who wrote and directed the day reagan was shot sticks close to the facts but does n't share mr stone 's creative flair the assassination attempt is recreated in a quick cut style that mimics the jittery news film without capturing its shocking effect but the story 's focus is on the chaotic aftermath and richard dreyfuss deserves his top billing as haig all the president 's men bumble the running of the country secure phone lines do n't work they squabble about whether the level of military readiness has officially been heightened but haig makes a major grab for power and even mistakenly tells the public he is next in line for the presidency after the vice president taking his cue from the heavy handed script mr dreyfuss has a mad dog demeanor from the start much of the film takes place in the white house situation room as other cabinet members and advisers try to calm the rabid haig the rational dignified secretary of defense caspar w weinberger is played by the always superb colm feore thirty two short films about glenn gould with an understated realism that stands out among much scenery chewing next to the pointed dialogue that zooms around the situation room on the west wing these re creations are cartoonish meanwhile the president 's advisers at the hospital including the deputy chief of staff michael k deaver michael murphy effectively manage the news mr reagan was much closer to death than the public knew but today that is not surprising to anyone informed about the events and the story is not presented dramatically enough to grab anyone who is n't richard crenna does n't try to impersonate reagan beyond a tilt of the head all he has to do is be there and mouth a few familiar lines honey i forgot to duck he tells holland taylor who plays nancy straightforwardly as the fiercely devoted wife the day reagan was shot is more interesting for the way it plays next to the documentaries in bulletproof which precedes it mr deaver describes how the president insisted on walking from his car into the hospital when he hit the door frame his knees went out from under him he says it was as if the curtain was there and he had performed when we got to the curtain he gave out the film 's reagan insists on walking too but while he wobbles a bit he never buckles making it all the way to the trauma room on his own in these interpretations the nonfiction reagan is a consummate actor and the fictional reagan just that strong a guy at reagan 's side which follows the movie includes snippets of an audiotape of the situation room conversation made by richard v allen the national security adviser in interviews mr allen and mr weinberger reinforce some portrayals and suggest that their resentment of mr haig 's behavior has persisted through the years but mr allen also says that mr haig was never in charge of anything that day everyone agrees that one person not in charge was the president mr nowrasteh who wrote the pilot for the television series la femme nikita has said i 've really come to respect president reagan and nancy reagan enormously and i hope the movie shows that you have to assume it 's inadvertent then that this muddled film reinforces the image of ronald reagan as the president in the empty suit 'hell in the pacific the learning channel tonight at 9 facts alone are not always enough to carry a documentary but the graphic news film and photographs in this program about world war ii combat in the pacific are amazing on their own presented today to commemorate the bombing of pearl harbor the program includes interviews with allied and japanese soldiers as well as combat film that deserves its advisory stating the images may disturb some viewers the documentary does not clean up the americans ethnic slurs and blunt desire to kill japanese and does not shy away from photographs of japanese atrocities one chinese woman has a chunk missing from the back of her neck where the japanese tried to behead her hell in the pacific is not artistically made but it is enormously valuable as an addition to better known images of nazi atrocities and as a counterpoint to greatest generation
