 due preparations for the plague by janette turner hospital 401 pp new york w w norton company 2495 in the late 1980 's arab terrorists hijack an airliner en route from paris to new york after making a stop in germany to release 22 children and to refuel they land at tikrit in iraq when their demands for the release from prison of others in their group are rejected the hijackers blow up the plane all the passengers die except for 10 who are placed in a sealed bunker filled with sarin gas protective clothing and masks will work for only 24 hours the hijacking in fact is a sting operation unscrupulously risky set in motion by american intelligence risk becomes lethal inevitability when the sting is stung in its turn by the arab double agent whom the americans had employed to lead the action using the form of a politico literary thriller janette turner hospital has attempted a metaphysical novel of evil in this case as in some of her previous work notably the mesmeric novel the last magician the subject is the nightmare of power due preparations for the plague the title and the frequent quotes from camus indicate the author 's larger intentions is a descent through dantean circles of governmental conspiracy and betrayal hospital can be a strong and visionary writer but she is no virgil even granting her the role she has chosen the wrong vehicle a skateboard for a trip through hell the political thriller however gnarled calls for an agile energy of maneuver and a sharp if subtle definition of plot and character practitioners like graham greene and john le carre at his less self indulgent were able to infuse a tremor of time and world out of joint into their dexterous twists and betrayals in due preparations there is more than a tremor an avalanche of galactic foreboding effaces the thriller 's need for ultimately patterned logic and is at the same time artificially crimped by it the story begins a dozen years after the hijacking when the children saved from the plane have formed a support group led by samantha who came upon a code name salamander in her search of censored official documents the group has begun to focus on its suspicions of a sting several among them samantha 's lover meet with fatal mishaps samantha recruits an initially reluctant lowell whose mother perished on the flight she was leaving her husband for a jewish violinist also a victim the husband lowell 's father was a former high ranking cia operative he has just died in a car crash following an apparent heart attack his identity as salamander takes gradual fuzzy shape and it also turns out that he had given an airport locker key to his psychiatrist with instructions to turn it over to lowell after much hesitating lowell opens the locker and retrieves some notebooks and audiotapes their contents tell much of the rest of the story in a retrospect so fractured and swiveling that the reader puts as much effort into figuring out what hospital is up to as into following what happens her convolutions supply almost as much mystery as the plot itself they also account for a large part of the book 's paranoid atmosphere blindfolded as it were we hear not only noises but silences we take for noises from the tapes and from other accounts we learn of betrayals betrayed and of the sinister connections that maneuvered certain selected victims onto the passenger list of that ill fated flight salamander had been in charge of designing the trap using a saudi agent code named sirocco to set up the hijacking another intelligence official denouncing the plan is not only overruled but eliminated later that is to say earlier in the book 's vertigo of sequence salamander makes a last minute effort to have his wife postpone her trip this follows a tense confrontation with sirocco sleek and murderous in a paris restaurant an agent whom salamander infiltrated into his own entourage big spies have little spies on their backs to stab them and little spies littler spies etc had warned that the plan would be hijacked along with the plane sirocco whose real masters are saudis connected bin laden like to the royal family is following the instructions that the americans many jewish must die he scorns salamander 's threat to expose him to the police he has arranged for salamander 's french daughter by a mistress to be on the flight and he will warn her not to board only if matters are allowed to take their course this is a well contrived scene in a ludicrously inflamed scenario another is a teasingly complex tangle where two former lovers one american and one french are reunited by a series of phony double messages that end up getting both of them aboard the hijacked flight it 's a puzzle that succeeds hard to work out but absorbing and despite the result oddly playful other twists and turns could as well be jobbed in from the whole range of spy thriller literature and arranged any which way the major characters samantha lowell and salamander are drawn in terms only of their extravagant plights without other rounding or nuance they serve to racket the plot along even more they serve to declare the existential anguish that the plot aims to nourish much of this anguish is in the voice of lowell 's father on the tapes reaching a pitch of near madness including sporadic efforts to present salamander as someone other than himself at one point he delivers a ranting speech to cia recruits conjuring them up as helots who must do dreadful things on behalf of a higher duty and comparing them among other extravagances to shadrach meshach and abednego who enter the fiery furnace at god 's command we make firestorms from air and we walk through the fire unharmed we are zeus of the thunderbolts an even higher pitch is reached in the climactic scene with the 10 hostages in the bunker facing death when their protective gear fails a yiddish writer does a hasidic dance a philosopher delivers a wry deconstructive analysis two lovers embrace a diva sings orlando gibbons 's setting the silver swan who living had no note when death approached unlocked her silent throat it should be a moving triumphant pageant humanity refusing to be dehumanized by power 's purposes the government 's or the terrorists' staginess swamps it throughout the contrivances of the thriller have been shoved askew by symbolic purpose now the culminating symbol is marred by contrivance 's shadows richard eder writes book reviews and articles for the times
