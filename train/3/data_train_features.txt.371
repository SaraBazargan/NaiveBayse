 following are excerpts from a news conference yesterday by secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld and gen richard b myers chairman of the joint chiefs of staff as recorded by federal document clearing house inc a complete transcript is online at nytimescom international mr rumsfeld as the coalition continues to close on baghdad there likely will be difficult days ahead but the regime is under increasing pressure their republican guard forces are being defeated by coalition airstrikes and by effective ground engagements some units are laying down their arms and surrendering to coalition forces wisely choosing not to die fighting for a doomed regime the regime has been forced to backfill its baghdad defenses with regular army units forces that they have historically considered less reliable which is a sign that they know they 're in difficulty while coalition forces have taken extraordinary measures to protect innocent civilians in this war saddam hussein has sent death squads to massacre innocent iraqi muslims indeed saddam hussein has killed more muslim people than perhaps any living person on the face of the earth the day is fast approaching when his murderous rule will end questions and answers q mr secretary you referred to some of the republican guard forces laying down arms can you tell us whether some of them have actually been withdrawn deliberately back into the city limits mr rumsfeld my impression is that it 's all of the above that some forces have in fact retreated into cities others have just left and gone home still others have surrendered still others are still there fighting and have been reinforced both with remnants of other republican guard units and also regular army forces q mr secretary you said a moment ago that iraq is running out of real soldiers and that all will be left are war criminals is that a warning that if these military leaders do n't give up now that they 'll be considered war criminals or is that an appeal to surrender mr rumsfeld i guess it 's a reflection of what 's taking place there there are any number of soldiers that are behaving as soldiers and they have been either surrendering being captured or being killed or they 're still there fighting there are others who have left and gone into a different mode where they are in civilian clothes and they are operating out of cities and they are putting themselves in close proximity of schools hospitals mosques and the like and conducting themselves less as soldiers and more as war criminals q what can you tell us about what it appears the special republican guard and the other security organizations around saddam hussein appear to be doing in baghdad now as it seems that the arrival of american forces is imminent mr rumsfeld they have conducted exercises over recent months and have block captains and they have dug trenches to put oil in to burn things they have done a variety of things that suggest that they anticipate that they could end up in the city of baghdad and they 've had various perimeter defenses q we 've heard a lot from people at the podium about securing the southern oil fields but not very much about what 's going on in the north to try to secure those fields mr rumsfeld we have to assume that they 've been wired with explosives as some were in the south we also would like very much to get in there and be able to assure that they are not damaged and cause a major environmental problem and general franks has ways of doing that at the right time q general myers i wanted to take you back to the whole issue of urban conflict can you give the public a sense of how the us has advanced from the days of you may think of the battle of hue in vietnam or stalingrad there 's these images of apocalyptic urban conflict general myers first of all you never know i mean how it 's going to go out the tactical situation could be very different from what we suppose and so i mean you 're just going to have to be ready for lots of things but you 've got a city of baghdad you 've got about five million residents half of whom are shia that have been persecuted by the regime probably will not be friendly to the regime they 're basically on the eastern half of the city you could assume that they might be helpful when you get to the point where baghdad is basically isolated then what is the situation you have in the country you have a country that baghdad no longer controls that whatever 's happening inside baghdad is almost irrelevant compared to what 's going on in the rest of the country what 's going on in the rest of the country well you have the southern oil fields we 'll see about the north you have the face now by this time probably of an iraqi interim administration some form of people standing up now starting to work the postconflict governance it 'll take some time but you 'll have that you 're going to have half the population that probably wants nothing to do with the folks the regime and then you 'll start working at it as you can but one of the things you can do is be patient about that so this notion of a siege and so forth i think is not the right mental picture q mr secretary do you have any information that would lead you to believe that a third party perhaps a foreign government such as france or russia might be encouraging what 's left of saddam 's regime to just hang on in hopes of cutting some kind of a deal and is there any deal available to them short of their end mr rumsfeld the answer 's yes and no there 's no question but that some governments are discussing from time to time some sort of a cutting a deal and the inevitable effect of it let there be no doubt is to give hope and comfort to the saddam hussein regime and give them ammunition that they can then try to use to retain the loyalty of their forces with hope that one more time maybe he 'll survive one more time maybe he 'll be there for another decade or so for another 17 or 18 un resolutions and as to the second question there 's not a chance that there 's going to be a deal it does n't matter who proposes it there will not be one q mr secretary i presume you 're pleased but are you also puzzled by the fact that the iraqis have n't used any chemical or biological weapons mr rumsfeld we 've always believed that the chances of their being used increase the closer that coalition forces got to baghdad i suspect that the regime has a dilemma if on the one hand they are holding out hope with their people that there might be a deal cut the use of chemical weapons would certainly end that prospect and that being the case they have to be balancing that do they want to not use all their weapons and hope that they can get a deal when it 's not even a remote possibility or will they go ahead and use them and totally eliminate the perception in their people that he might survive because once he uses those it 's pretty clear there ca n't be a deal so that 's the dilemma i suspect he faces q and is there a special military response to a chemical weapons attack mr rumsfeld we 've allowed as how we thought that they 'd best not use those weapons and i do n't want to go beyond that
