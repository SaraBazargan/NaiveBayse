 a prominent figure in celebrity folklore is the blonde bottle or real who accedes to stardom by scheming or seducing or marrying or some combination of the three think marilyn monroe madonna princess diana even senator hillary rodham clinton now think tina brown according to a trashy new biography brown the former editor of the new yorker and the current one of talk was born into obscurity the british kind which means she lacked a peerage and required ruthless drive sexual wiles and marriage to harry evans to overcome that condition naturally her story ends badly these stories are gratifying only when they do for those who have somehow avoided the gossip dribbling out of harry and tina come to america by judy bachrach here 's her version of brown 's life the daughter of a b grade british film producer and his socially ambitious wife brown goes to oxford but only to one of its lesser women 's colleges she overcomes that handicap with the single mindedness of a character played by reese witherspoon among the many men she takes up with are martin amis and auberon waugh who usher her into the world of literary celebrity next she writes a play that is produced and favorably reviewed back at oxford though brown is not taken seriously her maternal grandfather having been jewish snootier oxonians refuse to be impressed she 's a tough ambitious girl clearly very ambitious she 's jewish and quite like her mother one of them tells bachrach years later she is to journalism what barbra streisand is to movies says another however as a freelancer with a satiric eye she attracts the attention of evans the popular equally nonaristocratic editor of what many believed to be the best british newspaper of the day the sunday times he leaves his wife and three children for her she takes a job editing tatler a failing society magazine and turns it around by simultaneously sucking up to and making fun of the socialites who read it evans loses his job after rupert murdoch buys the times brown gets an even better one having been asked to rescue a foundering vanity fair by si newhouse who has bought tatler the rest their move to america her editorship of the new yorker his of random house has been material for gossip columns ever since so what after all this time are we to make of harry evans and tina brown bachrach is little help in this department if you want to understand evans whose genuine charm and love of journalism wilt on bachrach 's pages read philip norman 's everyone 's gone to the moon a wry roman a clef of evans 's and brown 's early careers as for brown bachrach is too busy for larger opinions she 's got to snipe at brown for everything from not being pretty or fashionable enough to minor infractions of the often overwrought american conflict of interest rules but the book does offer despite itself some insights into the woman who obsessed new york media society until roughly last year when talk began to seem like just another closable start up for one thing contrary to brown 's reputation as a humorless ice goddess she 's capable of a sly wickedness once after she invited the comedian roseanne barr to be guest editor of a special issue of the new yorker devoted to women george w s trow resigned from the magazine with a note comparing her to someone selling her soul to get close to the hapsburgs 1913 brown wrote back i am distraught at your defection but since you never actually write anything i should say i am notionally distraught another insight provided by bachrach has less to do with the content of her book than with the ironic implications of her style which she honed as a writer for yes vanity fair though after brown left to skewer brown and evans with nasty personal gossip is to practice what brown perfected the journalism of dish what 's striking is how tedious it is at vanity fair brown 's editorial philosophy was informed by two insights first that celebrities are intrinsically worth knowing about no matter what they 're like and second that american celebrities take themselves very seriously that means they must be praised with great earnestness or smeared with all available dirt with the intensity due to people of their station to read bachrach is to flash back to the unintended literary consequences of this approach on the new yorker despite brown 's admirable efforts to jolt the magazine out of its twee complacency her brave defiance of its clubbiness her hiring of talented young editors and writers she imposed a tone as crippling as the one she set out to replace brown was wicked but not wicked enough the problem with her many chronicles about hollywood stars and media moguls was n't vulgarity it was all that face time with people whose personalities resisted writers best efforts to bring them to life brown 's new yorker had its moments especially at the beginning when she 'd kept the best of the old and had n't succumbed to the worst of the new it was exhilarating to watch the rapid emergence of new names format changes and subjects previously deemed too down market to deal with there were triumphs lawrence wright exposing recovered memory syndrome as a fraud richard preston on the ebola virus the talk of the town department was briefly delightful though its bumbling british editor alexander chancellor was the laughingstock of new york at the time his section finessed brown 's demand that every subject be hot with a skepticism so dry and genial it apparently went unnoticed eventually brown developed the confidence to act on her own passions as every editor must but confined as she had been to the climate controlled environment of new york limousine culture many of them turned out to be airless brown 's deepest emotional connection appeared to be to other female celebrities there was the special new yorker issue devoted to princess diana there was that scoop in the first issue of talk in which hillary rodham clinton revealed bill 's childhood abuse bachrach says brown so strongly identified with the beleaguered first lady that she took over the editing of the piece writing in a comparison between hillary and diana that mortified the article 's author after some wrangling it was dropped it 's as if brown had grown attached to the tabloid inflected tragic vision of herself long before bachrach happened along to write it down if talk fails as many suspect it will will brown 's future be as bleak as bachrach seems to want it to be the media world is darwinian and rarely grants a second chance to editors nearing 50 but even bachrach hints at a more appealing possible twist it seems brown has been keeping a diary since she was 12 the thought is awe inspiring it 's no stretch to imagine her as the chronicler of her era the samuel pepys of late 20th century trans atlantic society she 's got the access maybe she 'll finally let loose the wit
