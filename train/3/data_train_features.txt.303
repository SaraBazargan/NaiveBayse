 traveling with george w bush 's 2000 campaign alexandra pelosi kept her video camera running and came up with this startling revelation about the man who would be president sometimes he talks with his mouth full really full of cheese and crackers that was no mere slip he is also caught talking with a mouthful of what appears to be a sandwich fortunately for mr bush the democrats never attacked him on the gross table manners issue there 's a lot about food in journeys with george an amusing breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail made when ms pelosi was an nbc news producer it 's a witty reminder that campaigns are an endless string of foolish events and photo ops that are wildly detached from the hard issues a president has to deal with there 's mr bush driving a snowmobile in new hampshire proving what that he can make a quick getaway if ufo 's land in the rose garden during a blizzard we knew that about campaigns but the documentary reinforces the idea with wonderful timing it will be shown tonight on hbo arriving on an election day fraught with issues like terrorism and a floundering economy halfway through mr bush 's term journeys with george is like a time capsule taking us back to 1999 when mr bush was trying to overcome his frat boy image much of the documentary was shot on the press plane where reporters campaign staffers and the candidate himself all pretend to let their hair down and act as if they 're not on opposite sides of a public relations war mr bush makes funny faces as he plays to the camera he teases ms pelosi about her love life charms her and treats her as comic relief stop filming me you 're like a head cold he says with a warm smile it 's a thoroughly disarming tactic after one particularly mangled speech he gets on the plane 's public address system and makes fun of his own grammatical flubs he is the living image of the guy for whom his campaign mass produces homemade looking signs that read love ya dubya but this likable guy is rarely asked to talk about issues instead ms pelosi interviews her acerbic colleagues about their insular repetitive lives as they all traipse from one orchestrated event to another at 90 minutes the film is about a half hour too long but it backs up what a reporter for the financial times of london tells her about the process of campaigning for the most powerful job in the world most of our time is spent doing really stupid things in stupid places with stupid people ms pelosi is upfront about her own politics narrating in a raspy singsong voice that reinforces the sense of watching a home movie she says early on that her mother is representative nancy pelosi a democrat from california and the house minority whip and she has said that viewers will impose their own political slants on the film bush supporters will find the portrait humanizing while the anti bush contingent will see a bobble headed bush doll but she skirts political issues so widely that even that seems unlikely when she promoted the show on late night last week conan o'brien watched a scene of mr bush munching cheetos and joked i like him better already you can only find political links by stretching a point here and there when ms pelosi pulls out her absentee ballot and asks mr bush why she should vote for him he sits in the seat next to her joking and giving her campaign platitudes more tellingly he takes the ballot from her hand and says how does it work for starters and it was n't even from florida it was a california ballot and behind mr bush 's back she votes for bill bradley near the end of the campaign ms pelosi takes a straw poll among the margarita fueled reporters on the plane who predict al gore will win when that tidbit turns up in a gossip column the other reporters stop talking to her mr bush saves her by walking up putting a friendly arm around her shoulder and quietly offering some advice she says that he told her when they see me talking to you they 're going to act like your friends again but those people are n't your friends they can say what they want about me but at least i know who i am and who my friends are it 's a lesson he obviously learned at his father 's knee and that ms pelosi says she learned at that moment with its suggestion that every second of his supposedly candid behavior was cautious after all that may be the most honest and revealing comment in the film either that or mr bush 's flat out statement i like a good baloney sandwich journeys with george hbo tonight at 9 30 eastern and pacific times 8 30 central time written directed and produced by alexandra pelosi co directed and edited by aaron lubarsky julie anderson supervising producer for hbo sheila nevins executive producer for hbo
