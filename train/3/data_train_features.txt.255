 as a general rule the better the restaurant the longer it takes to hit its stride when the place has lofty ambitions as atelier does the general rule becomes an iron law what is a critic to do common sense says to wait say six months before writing a review let the chef and the rest of the team find their footing in the real world however common sense is nonsense readers can not wait indefinitely forks at the ready to get the lowdown on an important new restaurant the critic 's job is to get a review to the table while it 's still hot when i visited atelier shortly after it opened in the spring of last year it was already a fine restaurant the executive chef gabriel kreuther had a very distinctive style classically french but quite fresh and modern with an ingenious use of herbs to create new flavors the kitchen 's shortcomings were precisely those one might expect given a cuisine marked by subtlety refinement and precision some dishes seemed a little blurry and unfocused others seemed slightly out of register or a few degrees off center but the promise was there the only thing atelier needed was the thing that no critic can give which was more time a little more than year later atelier has firmly established itself as one of the city 's finest french restaurants there 's simply no question about it mr kreuther continues to come up with dazzling ideas achieving exciting flavor effects through unexpected means he excels at lighter than air herb based sauces that shine a new flattering light on the main ingredients of a dish a bright basil jus freshened with pea shoots brings out the almost fulsome richness of foie gras without resorting to the usual fruit chutneys compotes or syrups that can weigh down an already dangerously heavy ingredient the musky penetrating flavor of licorice root is a like a sexy perfume applied with a delicate touch to a pristine block of east coast halibut a salad of new onions celery and almonds evens out the equation with a touch of asperity and sweetness fennel orange salad combining an aromatic vegetal note with sweet but acidic fruit flavor perfectly suits roasted langoustines sprinkled with sesame seeds mr kreuther 's range is impressive his menu embraces minimalist spa dishes like steamed black sea bass in a lemon verbena jus and a punchy explosively flavorful oxtail crepinette stuffed with wild mushrooms and coated almost like a candy apple in a sticky syrupy reduction it 's a profound meat experience as though a 20 ounce rib eye has been compressed into a container the size of a squash ball weaving in and out of the menu are dishes that read like exercises in whimsy but turn out to have the irrefutable logic of a mathematical theorem champagne sauce has the deceptive tensile strength of a spider web sweet and slightly piquant it stands up to a muscular slab of wild salmon coated in a hot horseradish crust perhaps most impressive is the featherweight fines herbes jus pooled around slices of pink muscovy duck baked in a clay papillote as with the seared foie gras mr kreuther reveals the flavor of his main ingredients without resorting to the usual syrups and fruit sauces he has a talent for confounding expectations several dishes have kept their place on the menu for obvious reasons toasted flour soup is a rustic appetizer with a smoky even baconlike flavor frog legs cut into tender lumps the size of gnocchi bob in the soup their sweetness nicely offset by the sharp bite of fresh onion sprouts rabbit and riesling a classic combination gets a neat twist at atelier where the rabbit is cooked with riesling and hyssop a highly aromatic herb with a resemblance to thyme and formed into a terrine it 's served in neat slices with a fines herbes coulis and there will never be a valid excuse for dropping this appetizer from the menu the dining room is quiet and civilized that has been true from the outset but the service now feels much more assured and relaxed there is a definite style now at the city 's top french restaurants a french american hybrid that developed in reaction to the stuffy rulebound service mandatory at michelin starred paris restaurants without sacrificing efficiency or expertise it takes the starch out of fine dining waiters and sommeliers interact more freely with customers in a freer easier american style restaurant daniel has brought this style to absolute perfection and atelier has clearly signed onto the program it is committed to delivering luxury and indulgence but the experience like the sauces never weighs heavily the restaurant has a new pastry chef eric hubert who like mr kreuther is a graduate of jean georges he 's a bit of a showboat and a magpie too having cooked or done consulting work for restaurants as various as vong patria and typhoon his more flamboyant impulses play well against mr kreuther 's highly disciplined cuisine atelier is a hotel restaurant a setting that almost demands fireworks on the dessert plate as well as a sense of fun mr hubert delivers lots of both whether it 's a carved ice pedestal for two scoops of ice cream or the fancifully named strawberry game a checkerboard of strawberry flavored agar with a strawberry tart and a shallow pool of strawberry water his cherry sampler is a whirlwind tour of cherry flavors expressed in gradations from tart to very sweet in a vacherin a terrific clafoutis a savarin and amusingly in a little scoop of chopped up relish billed as a tartare you have to laugh cherry tartare seems ridiculous yet perfect for atelier whose refined aesthetic places a premium on pure pleasure and the shock of the unexpected it 's a difficult combination to master but mr kreuther has done it with total assurance all he needed was a chance to warm up atelier rating
