 in january hundreds of millions of monarch butterflies were killed by a storm on their winter roosting grounds in mexico leaving scientists and countless monarch lovers wondering how the surviving insects would fare when they migrated back to the united states and canada now scientists have learned that as many feared monarch numbers plunged over large areas of the united states this summer particularly on the east coast where butterflies showed up late and in small numbers or did n't show up at all but more surprising a new study has found that these resilient insects have had what is adding up to be a surprisingly average year in the heart of their breeding range in the midwest it 's on the low side but still well within the realm of normal numbers said dr karen oberhauser of tallies from the corn belt where most of the monarchs that migrate to mexico are thought to originate an ecologist at the university of minnesota she leads a nationwide monarch monitoring project sponsored by the national science foundation she added i do n't think we can say the monarchs are in big trouble this year the data are collected by hundreds of volunteers who each follow a specific protocol monitoring a field or patch of milkweed plants the food plant of monarch caterpillars for the entire summer they count eggs and caterpillars also known as larvae with the entire group surveying a grand total of more than 25000 milkweed plants each week a unique combination of nature and science education and large scale scientific research the monarch larva monitoring project is the only long term systematic nationwide study of population fluctuations in this species of insect the study which is recruiting more volunteers has a web site wwwmlmporg cindy petersen a middle school science teacher in chanhassen minn has been monitoring a site with students for four years i was expecting the worst she said actually they did very well when i compare numbers with other years it 's been pretty stable but such results were little comfort to the many further east who spent the summer waiting for butterflies that never came it 's been awful this year said gillian tuttle a retired nurse and substitute teacher in moravian falls nc who never saw a single egg on the milkweeds she monitored on her rural property it 's alarming scientists say spring freezes in texas when the butterflies were arriving and widespread summer drought did not help monarch numbers this year either the university of minnesota study 's results were generally corroborated by the more informal fourth of july butterfly survey of all species organized each year by the north american butterfly association and by numerous anecdotal reports the die off last winter could still end up having lasting significance if as some scientists fear that was only the first of the major freezes the butterflies will encounter as loggers and residents continue to degrade the mexican forests or the die off could end up being a historical blip for these butterflies whose females can lay a whopping 700 eggs while many find the low numbers in the northeast worrisome dr oberhauser notes that if most of the monarchs in mexico do come from the corn belt as recent research suggests eastern populations might not have a huge impact on numbers that actually migrate in the most recent of the year 's unexpected tallies the fall migration along the east coast has been surprisingly healthy dick walton a naturalist and author who has monitored the monarch migration from the cape may observatory in new jersey in collaboration with dr lincoln brower at sweet briar college in virginia for the last 12 years said they had already seen some thick flights of monarchs we saw 108 yesterday afternoon and that 's a fairly good sample he said of counts during a five mile census i 'm actually a little surprised but cautioning that the migration was not even half over he said we need to wait and see what happens
