 the st patrick pageant promised to be a rich mixture of history and legend spiced with both sanctity and irreverence instead it was like an irish stew with too many ingredients the madcap extravaganza offered on thursday night at the joyce soho combined text and choreography by clare byrne with original music by rodrigo joaquin alonzo and jason crigler and a taped collage that included various folk and blues songs a lot happened elmer moore jr was a perpetually antic st patrick jennifer a cooper who also designed the costumes many of them appropriately green portrayed the saint 's accordion playing lamb amy larimer and ruben ortiz were clouds theresa palazzo sarah carlson and donna bouthillier played several creatures including snakes mr alonzo the singing narrator spent much time sitting on a toilet in this production designed by matt allar predictably the show had its share of toilet jokes some of the strands in the many story lines dealt with moving from mexico to the united states vain attempts to leave topeka kan and of course st patrick who got entangled sometimes in an implicitly erotic fashion with the creatures the slinky snakes hissed and twisted but sins were apparently forgiven at the conclusion it was hard to care much about all this characterizations were insufficiently vivid and the shifts from ireland to topeka in the multitude of plots and subplots seemed muddled rather than stimulatingly complex the st patrick pageant soon became theatrical blather jack anderson
