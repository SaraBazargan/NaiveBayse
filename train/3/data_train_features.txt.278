 ever since jane swift ran for lieutenant governor of massachusetts her life has resembled one of those old airport movies in which there 's a bomb on the plane the stewardess is sucked out the window the captain has a heart attack the little girl on a ventilator starts wheezing and somebody suddenly notices that the flight has wandered into north korean airspace we will skip past ms swift 's successful foray into campaigning while pregnant followed by the deeply unsatisfactory using the staff for baby sitters episode since then she has discovered she is expecting twins while the governor paul cellucci split town to become ambassador to canada ms swift who is rather short on cash and lives a two and a half hour drive from the capital wound up acting governor of the only state in the union that does not provide its executive with an official residence this week when her doctors ordered her to spend the last weeks of her pregnancy in a hospital bed it turned out that ms swift is also running the only state in the union in which the state employees do not get paid unless the governor or lieutenant governor meets every single week with an obscure commission that has the formal power to approve the disbursing of the cash so ms swift who is a republican tried to run the critical meeting via speakerphone but the governor 's council eight democrats who get paid 24000 apiece to approve judicial nominations and shuffle a great deal of paper decided to ask the state supreme court to rule on the legality of the speakerphone gambit this is not a duly constitutional meeting said edward o'brien the most veteran council member who also happens to be the father of the state treasurer this treasurer also happens to be a potential gubernatorial candidate who delivered her first child during a leave of absence from her official duties really this just goes on and on my parents did n't raise me to submarine a female co worker 's career simply because she 's pregnant said mary ellen manning the newest council member it 's a lousy thing to do those of us who do n't live in massachusetts are mainly interested in what lessons we can draw from this drama should ms swift take a leave and let the democratic secretary of state run the show are the democrats picking on a woman while she 's down or at best sitting up in bed i kind of like blaming the governor who fled to canada i do n't think he should have left her in those circumstances said ms manning he should have waited until she delivered a pregnant woman can certainly be governor but i think i speak for us all in suggesting that a semi homeless extremely pregnant woman is not in the perfect position to suddenly take over the job mr cellucci could have timed his departure better he 's going to be ambassador to canada for heaven 's sake our neighbors to the north could have managed on their own until the twins arrived the former governor now in washington where he 's attending ambassador school said the president had wanted him to be in office for last month 's summit of the americas plus i reject the notion that a pregnant woman ca n't be governor he said this is about gender bias somehow i suspect this is about mr cellucci 's desperate desire to get a job that did not involve running for re election as a republican in massachusetts but the current controversy is actually a great political boon for ms swift the state 's mum in chief somehow managed to give birth to her first child and make her way through a challenging second pregnancy without even slightly endearing herself to the people of massachusetts after defending the acting governor this week though ms manning could feel public sentiment turning i went into the diner this morning and everybody said how pretty i looked on tv and that i was absolutely right she added with pleasure i 'm really kind of plain so that was nice of them to say and my phone 's ringing off the hook ms manning a lawyer thinks ms swift would have a great case against the commonwealth if she chose to sue for her rights under the state labor laws i wish i could have given her my card but that would be ambulance chasing she mused
