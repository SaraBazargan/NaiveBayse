 it 's not easy to hide a restaurant smack dab in the middle of midtown but i defy anyone to summon up a mental picture of 41st street between madison and park avenues better yet thanks to several double crosses perpetrated by the one way traffic system i 'm sure i could get rich betting motorists that they ca n't get there on the first try the reason to take the trouble is virot a new restaurant in the equally new dylan hotel didier virot formerly the executive chef at jojo and sous chef at jean georges has set up shop in what once was the ballroom of the chemists club a doubly perplexing spot who knew that chemists had a club or that they gave balls it 's a quirky place for a restaurant but mr virot may be just the chef for it he 's inventive with an antic streak he takes risks some of them do n't pay off but diners will not leave virot feeling that they 've had an ordinary meal mr virot starts with a main ingredient indicated in big boldface type on the menu and treats it like a star he has an admirable sense of proportion never letting his supporting cast of flavors and ingredients take over the stage ruby colored slices of tuna marinated with cucumber and coriander take on the lightest possible layering of spice and green freshness fresh horseradish in sheep 's milk yogurt gives a subtle kick to the flavors like the quick twist of the projectionist 's lens that brings a film into sharp focus feather light gnocchi in a rich emulsion of black truffles and cream melt on the tongue with textural contrast provided by slices of jerusalem artichoke another pleasing little touch is the addition of toasted almonds to vegetable soup with a small island of peekytoe crab in the center big fat shrimp cooked to a light outer crisp on a skewer with some basil leaves work one of those minor miracles encountered more often in print than in restaurants they remind you of what shrimp used to taste like mr virot does not get in their way he applies a light saffron mustard dressing and piles a little salad of baby zucchini and radicchio on the side when mr virot slips there 's no mistaking it chanterelle tart with hazelnut spread is heavy and unappealing his foie gras terrine with artichoke and rutabaga barely registers on the palate it 's so muted and the cornmeal crisp that comes with it seems to have hopped on the plate from some other dish or even another restaurant absolutely first rate squab dark and livery never quite works out a livable relationship with the intriguing sounding oatmeal porcini cake i support the idea of an oatmeal porcini cake and i 'm glad that mr virot gave it a try but the thing itself has an unpleasantly slippery texture it feels as if it should be good for you which is a bad sign a much happier experiment in the same line is the cake of basmati rice that accompanies a magnificent lobster sauteed with cardamom and bathed with a caramel ginger sauce the rice cake is essence of crunch on the outside creamy on the inside an appropriately bland riposte to the subtle asian spicing that reflects the chef 's years with jean georges vongerichten mr virot has an eye as well as a palate he serves his main dishes on enormous nubbly square plates mustard yellow and cucumber green that recall the heroic ashtrays of a bygone era roasted black sea bass in a meaty olive sauce picks up a lovely splash of color from burgundy carrots braised in butter and meyer lemon juice and it 's as much a matter of eye appeal as anything else that brings long strands of pale yellow wax beans to a neat arrangement of three brick red lamb chops and sweet couscous dotted with black and golden raisins gorgeously spiced with turmeric cinnamon and cardamom and then shaped into a neat cupcake the lamb chop triad parts to reveal alas a rather tough hunk of lamb shank virot 's pastry chef jehangir metha who has worked at jean georges and union pacific is a good fit he has a daring streak that suits mr virot 's menu he also has a sense of adventure that leads him to some very strange places my vote for the most challenging dessert in new york a title previously held by the picholine olive poundcake at aleutia now goes to the terminally strange dish billed as a salty caramel tapioca tart salt slime and a mango topping that keeps sliding off the tapioca are the main features of this truly memorable dessert but the weird tart shares menu space with a demure flawless flat cake made from ricotta cheese and roasted pineapple with a scoop of tart concentrated pineapple sorbet and with an awesomely dense almond creme brulee sprinkled with jujube chutney jewellike cubes of candied red date slowly cooked with cinnamon anise and pepper and drizzled with walnut oil mr mehta 's hazelnut souffle is pure intensely flavored and classic service is a little hushed and reverential at virot and the style can be traced directly to the chill formal room with its 24 foot ceilings and odd sense of stillness there 's an impressive monumentality to the old chemists ballroom that makes virot feel like the waiting room in a grand old train station upstairs a treasure awaits the balcony lounge it 's dark and intimate and for the moment at least it feels like a secret hideaway the best place to get lost in new york in other words is a block from grand central do n't tell anyone virot rating two
