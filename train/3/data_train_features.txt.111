 playing conditions changed today at the byron nelson championship but the leader remained the same after the wind changed direction overnight but was still gusting to 20 miles an hour vijay singh found himself playing a tpc at las colinas golf course this afternoon that he hardly recognized it was harder to score it was harder to choose clubs it was harder to remain patient and it was enough to frustrate many players like tim petrovic who shot a four over par 74 and tumbled out of contention while playing in the final group with singh but singh relied on the experience that comes from playing around the world and winning 33 events including two majors with crisp ball striking and a superb up and down to save par at no 17 singh protected the one stroke lead he started the round with and entered sunday 's final round as the player to beat singh shot a 69 to finish the third round at 11 under par 199 one stroke ahead of jeff sluman who shot a 68 today cameron beckman and luke donald were two strokes back tied for third after shooting 67 's with 17 players no more than five shots behind the event remains wide open and singh was slightly disappointed that he did not widen his margin but he was still in the best position to win the tournament i 'm still in the lead which is an important thing said singh who already has one victory this year at the phoenix open they still have to worry about catching me he added you do n't want to lose a golf tournament on saturday i have been known to get impatient but i stuck to it and i 'm quite happy still leading it took a splendid up and down at the par 3 200 yard no 17 for singh to keep his one stroke edge with the pin back and to the left singh hit a 7 iron off the tee figuring there was no way he could hit the ball over the green but the wind fooled him the ball sailed over the green into rough so thick that when singh arrived at his ball he could hardly see it he had little green to work with and little idea how the ball would react coming out of deep grass singh deftly pitched the ball onto the green and watched it roll softly just 7 feet past the pin the gallery cheered and singh appreciated how good a shot it was i was just trying to get it inside 10 feet and i made a perfect shot he said maybe if i put another 10 balls there i would n't get inside there singh made the putt then he made par at no 18 and looked forward to being paired with sluman on sunday at age 45 sluman hopes to join other over 40 winners on the tour this year including fred couples and scott hoch with six career victories sluman is not likely to be intimidated asked about playing with singh sluman said obviously he is a major winner he has won all over the world he is a big strong guy that hits it a mile and he 's fearless out there but i ca n't worry about whoever i am paired with that goes back to being more of a veteran player than a young guy if i was 24 or 25 i would be probably wondering how he thinks i am going to play is he going to be looking at my swing i wonder how he thinks i am swinging he could care less that 's not saying anything bad that 's reality you have to concentrate on your own game singh has concentrated on his game despite distractions last sunday he voiced opposition to annika sorenstam 's decision to compete on the pga tour next week saying in part she does n't belong out here it was a position that resulted in heavy criticism but with singh the golf course is a place of refuge he is a tireless worker known for spending hours at the range and at age 40 his practice routine has hardly slowed i do n't have too many other things to do he said i have a family but if i have a week off i take two days off and then what you have to prepare i have not lost the desire to practice nor has singh lost the desire to win and he will enter the final round in position to do it again woods is struggling alveslohe germany may 17 ap tiger woods had another poor putting day at the deutsche bank sap open today leaving him with little hope of catching the leader padraig harrington woods shot a two under par 70 and was at six under 210 through three rounds nine strokes behind harrington 201 who led by two strokes over graeme mcdowell harrington also led after the second round
