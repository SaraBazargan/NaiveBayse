 the be nice to monty buttons were on display today and for the most part the bulging united states open galleries obliged if only the unforgiving black course at bethpage state park had been so kind plagued by a chronically sore back and an inaccurate putting stroke colin montgomerie struggled to a five over par 75 leaving him eight strokes behind the leader tiger woods after the first round of the 102nd united states open montgomerie who turns 39 a week from sunday and who is still searching for his first major championship may have knocked himself out of contention early this time he bogeyed three of the first six holes he played as he opened his round on the course 's more difficult back nine after running off seven consecutive pars montgomerie made his only birdie at the par 4 fifth hole but followed it by bogeying three of the final four holes he played i wish monty was nicer to himself montgomerie said in brief remarks to reporters afterward at least montgomerie felt welcome the scottish born montgomerie has been the subject of widespread heckling at tournaments in the united states in the past to the point that he threatened this year never to come back but today he received nice ovations and vocal encouragement at nearly every hole there was a lot of love out there said mike o'malley the executive editor of golf digest whose magazine came up with the be nice to monty buttons as a way of defusing any potential animosity between montgomerie and the large crowds montgomerie 's often contentious relationship with fans in the united states dates from the 1997 open at congressional country club just outside washington where he was bothered by a commotion in the crowd while waiting to putt on the 71st hole montgomerie wound up second by a stroke to ernie els at the urging of a local radio host montgomerie was heckled at the 1998 open at the olympic club in san francisco the feud reached its peak during the 1999 ryder cup at the country club in brookline mass just outside boston where the united states made the greatest comeback in ryder cup history afterward montgomerie complained about the behavior of the fans and of the american players the animosity has never totally subsided after being heckled again in february at the world match play championship in carlsbad calif montgomerie threatened never to play in the united states again he returned in april for the masters however and the be nice to monty campaign was created golf digest got 35000 of the red white and black buttons to pass out at bethpage we were n't trying to be preachy at all o'malley said just cut a guy a break the vast majority of the crowd did just that today the fans at bethpage have been in a festive celebratory mood all week montgomerie who received a loud ovation this morning at the practice tee was the beneficiary of that good feeling today he nevertheless was not very pleased with his round i did n't putt very well he said as bad as my back was i usually could have holed at least four of the putts i missed that would have given me a 71 which would have been acceptable my only birdie was a four footer on the fifth and that was the longest putt i made all day that did not stop the crowd from encouraging montgomerie whose driver featured a head cover resembling the american flag good luck monty could be heard echoing from the gallery as he walked to the 10th tee to begin his round shouts of all right monty go get 'em monty and you da man monty rang out here and there throughout the day not that everyone was rooting for him as montgomerie and his playing partners mark o'meara and craig stadler walked to the 12th hole after montgomerie 's first bogey a fan shouted hey monty do n't choke perhaps the most biting comment came after montgomerie had finished his round with a bogey on the par 4 no 9 knowing that a second round score like today 's might prevent montgomerie from making the cut one fan called out hey monty i 've got mets tickets for sunday
