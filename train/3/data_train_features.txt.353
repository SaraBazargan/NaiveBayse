 the ruby room in roslyn estates has morphed into lisenda and long island diners are the beneficiaries in addition to the name changes include a new chef menu and prices paul paskins who had been executive chef at the kitchen on pine street in long beach now closed has created a menu of traditional dishes made exciting by unusual accompaniments a cocktail of four firm jumbo shrimp arrived in a martini glass atop a chunky avocado salsa fresca and a salad of cold poached asparagus in a lemon vinaigrette included halved hard boiled quail eggs pistachio nuts and small cubes of spanish manchego cheese a scattering of crispy bits resembling frizzled leeks turned out to be deep fried peelings from the asparagus both yummy appetizers were welcome openings to the meal also welcome were the new prices when the ruby room was reviewed in 2001 the soup of the day was 950 it is 650 on lisenda 's menu entrees two years ago were as high as 3950 evening specials topping out at 3750 and 3850 caused sticker shock when we received the bill at lisenda only one special at 3150 was over 30 even better all specials are printed with their prices the decor is the major constant at this restaurant it was lovely luxurious and opulent at the ruby room and still is lisenda shouts old world elegance from its carved high backed brocade upholstered chairs to its napkins in sumptuous fabrics brocade and velvet draperies vibrant paintings in massive gilt frames elaborate floral displays and baby grand piano a crowd of fat deep red candles burn on the window sills and in the fireplace while a single tall white taper crowns every table the tiny quaint cottage with its stuccoed walls and beamed ceiling has never looked better waiters with tuxedos also look spiffy adding an air of elegance to the room they are hardworking and efficient as well dishes were placed before the correct diner water glasses were kept full used silver was replaced after every course and the butter dish was replenished when empty a couple of appetizer specials were among the highest priced possibilities 1550 and 1750 but they were top of the line in quality as well warm wonderful miso glazed diver scallops atop cool greens with thin crisp slices of ginger and slivered almonds were the best bites of the meal there was nothing wrong either with the crab meat cocktail loaded with big chunks of sweet seafood another appetizer superstar was the feathery gnocchi in a lush shrimp saffron sauce from the regular menu black and white sesame coated tuna sashimi escorted by a spicy slaw of cucumber carrot and daikon and escargots paired with wild mushrooms in a creamy sauce with a puff pastry topper were other headliners the entrees included one loser a grilled veal chop evening special it was overcooked and tough a better selection from the specials list was flaky oven roasted black sea bass encircled with braised cauliflower and set upon a pleasant red pepper sauce high marks were racked up by the porcini dusted filet mignon alongside a truffle madeira sauce the steak was exceptionally flavorful and tender winning too was an assemblage of lobster medallions served in a puff pastry shell surrounded by claw meat and jumbo shrimp in a creamy brandied lobster sauce a good pick in the under  20 range 1950 was a bowl of spinach fettuccine tossed with crunchy asparagus slices of garlic cherry tomatoes and grilled chicken in a tasty white wine sauce the rack of lamb and the roast baby chicken were competently prepared but ordinary desserts were better than that the creme brulee was an especially worthy version of the classic not too sweet with a melt in the mouth texture and appropriately brittle caramelized shell the creamy individual cheesecake topped with fresh raspberries and the pill box chocolate cake filled with chocolate mousse and covered in a rich ganache hit all the right notes a lovely pear which had been poached in spiced ruby port was a superb way to end the meal the restaurant further ensured a sweet send off by offering a glass of port to each diner this along with the free tidbits at the beginning of the meal gravlax one night smoked salmon goat cheese mousse another and the assortment of superior breads and rolls helped make a meal at lisenda special lisenda 1 intervale avenue corner of mineola and warner avenues roslyn estates 516 621 2200 very good
