 secretary of state colin l powell said today that opposition around the world toward the war in iraq would pose a significant challenge for the united states in the future and that he never expected it would be as easy as some had thought to break the hold of saddam hussein 's government mr powell said that to counter global antiwar sentiments the united states would seek a major role for the united nations in a democratic postwar iraq move more aggressively to restart the israeli palestinian peace talks and reach out to friends with whom we may have been having some difficulty once we have been successful and we have prevailed and people realize that we have come to provide a better life for the people of iraq mr powell added i think you can turn this rather quickly the secretary 's comments came in a wide ranging interview much of it focused on his reflections about the war and the comments of some commanders and analysts that the current level of forces was not sufficient to win the war mr powell a former army general who was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has propounded the so called powell doctrine that war must be waged with overwhelming or at least decisive force asked whether the united states had fielded such a level of force mr powell demurred i think that they will bring decisive force to bear he said but what i do n't want to do is start commenting on the ups and downs the ins and outs of the daily battle but he explained that in anticipation of an adverse situation after the first week the pentagon had queued up lots of forces in anticipation that you may not know in the first week or so what the total requirement would be and that 's why there are forces that are still now flowing into the theater the secretary declined to say whether he had taken part in the debate with the president over what the size of the force should be i do n't discuss options that were presented to the president which were accepted which were discarded he said i defend the president 's positions and decisions in discussing the future of postwar iraq mr powell provided new details on the administration 's thinking his pledge for a big role by the united nations echoed prime minister tony blair at his joint news conference with president bush at camp david on thursday mr bush did not mention the united nations and some in the administration make no secret of their opposition to its playing a role particularly in any reconstruction of iraq the united nations has made it clear through the secretary general they do not want to become the new governing authority of iraq mr powell said but they have a role to play in many different ways he said the united nations was needed to provide international legitimacy to the occupation with a mischievous grin and a linguistic bow to france the major foe of the war the secretary then offered two metaphors for what he said washington wanted first he said the united nations would serve as a chapeau the french word for hat conferring broad legitimacy and endorsement of iraq 's postwar operations including some of its reconstruction second it would serve as a vessel receiving funds from aid groups and those financing iraq 's reconstruction as a practical matter mr powell said without some kind of international legitimacy iraq under an american  and british led occupation would not be able to produce currency that would be recognized by other countries or sell oil on the international market on the other hand he made clear that the military would have to be in charge at least at first so long as the situation in iraq remained unstable we 're the ones who are doing the fighting and the liberating with our friends in the coalition he said we believe we have an important role to play and to some extent drive this process until such time as there is an iraqi government that is functioning and running on other subjects mr powell took exception to many accounts suggesting that the administration 's so called preemption strategy contained in its national security strategy published last year meant that mr bush might use or threaten force against north korea and iran as the next stage of its policies noting that newspapers had written much about this strategy as guiding the iraq war and possible future confrontations mr powell said give me the evidence for this point of view just because there is a war with iraq that does n't mean we 're going to a war footing as soon as iraq is dealt with he said the president has available to him lots of tools and the tool you use is not always a hammer he added mr powell disputed news accounts of the administration 's actions once again when he said it was wrong to say that the effort to try to get a second security council resolution authorizing use of force against iraq was a mistake or a setback rather he said the effort had been closer to succeeding than was generally acknowledged but the united states let some countries willing to support the american position off the hook once it became clear that france was going to kill the resolution with a veto when we looked at that and realized the position this was putting some of our friends in he said and have them show their hand and still lose at that point it was sensible not to do that that 's diplomacy sometimes he also said the effort to get a second resolution enabled mr blair to quiet a revolt within his party over going to war in talking about all the predictions of quick success in iraq whether from surrender popular uprising or resignation by mr hussein he seemed more reflective than irritated over the many predictions that the war would go more easily than it has you know you may have to go and take a census of everybody but i had no illusions he said we all hoped for the best but you plan for not the best reminded that some had talked about the war being a cakewalk or rout the secretary said you can search my speakings and writings for years i never used expressions or terms or words like that war is not a game and it 's not a slogan these are young men and women who are being sent to their to their fate
