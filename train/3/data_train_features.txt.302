 for years suffolk county law enforcement authorities have been concerned that street gangs of the sort seen in the five western towns and nassau would some day spread to the east end now east end police officials and community leaders say there is mounting evidence that that time has come officials in southold town the most rural of long island 's 13 townships reported that during the past month they had charged several local men with crimes ranging from burglary to dwi all of whom admitted being or were identified as members of the salvadoran gang mara salvatrucha or ms 13 detective sgt john sinning of the southold town police said people wearing tattoos of the bloods another national street gang had also been seen in the town the riverhead police said they arrested and charged a group of young women with gang assault after an incident at riverhead high school late last year the rev marvin dozier who is leader of the southampton youth association and also has ministries at the unity baptist church in mattituck and the suffolk county jails said there had been repeated outbreaks of low level gang violence in southampton and bridgehampton mr dozier said he is seeing some gang movement on both forks particularly in greenport mattituck and cutchogue on the north fork and sections of bridgehampton and southampton on the south fork it is mostly neighborhood stuff he said they are cliques but there has been some effort to join some of the national groups the suffolk district attorney thomas j spota said that the east end gang activity included groups that are organized that engage in street crime and violence and have the paramilitary structure used by street gangs but that there is scant evidence of east end gangs having formal affiliations with the latin kings ms 13 the bloods the crips legion of doom and other national gangs that have established footholds up island hector lasalle a suffolk assistant district attorney warned however that the national gangs see suffolk county as fertile ground the first major action to curb gang activity in suffolk came soon after mr spota took office in january 2002 within weeks he established an anti gang task force that included agents from federal state and county law enforcement agencies the suffolk police commissioner john gallagher assigned 150 officers to the task force mr spota also increased the number of assistant district attorneys assigned to gang prosecutions to eight from one most work on up island problems but one anthony palumbo is specifically assigned to the five east end towns in the last year representatives from most of the east end police departments have participated in countywide gang awareness roundtables put on by the suffolk police department 's gang intelligence unit east hampton school officials said they are working with town police to prevent gang activity we are on the lookout for colors jewelry and so forth said leon parks assistant principal of east hampton high school capt richard smith of the riverhead police department said it was running informational seminars for parents and teachers and gathering intelligence on known gang members living in the area a riverhead high school senior who asked that he not be identified said some kids are running around the school doing the bloods symbol with their hands last fall there was one day where there were eight or nine fights in the high school between two groups of kids and the police had to be called in it was crazy fights were breaking out in the halls in between every period teachers had to escort us to our classrooms detective evelyn hobson of the riverhead police said the fights in the school were prompted by a dispute between two local gangs the doctor 's path flames and flanders finest later she said another round of fighting broke out between female members of both gangs five juveniles and one adult were arrested the girls who ranged in age from 14 to 16 were charged with gang assault donna lyczkowski is a youth counselor for the town of riverhead juvenile aid bureau they may not be the gangs as you know them in the big cities she said of the local groups but they are acting as gangs most riverhead parents do n't see the wannabe gangs as real problems ms lyczcowski said but when you look at how far east the serious gangs are it 's clear that if you do n't take a positive step toward preventing it it is going to be here one reason county officials are concerned about riverhead is that at any given time there are 200 inmates whom law enforcement has identified as gang members being held at the county jail which is in nearby riverside some of the gang members who are released from the county facility have relocated to riverhead and other east end towns according to police intelligence officials mr dozier said he has also observed increased gang activity at the correctional facility in riverhead sometimes our services are used for meeting places he said explaining that he has seen inmates flashing gang signals and signs during sermons the police in the town of southold said they too have become aware of a local street gang operating in their jurisdiction sergeant sinning said his officers are currently monitoring a gang of 12 to 15 individuals mainly greenport who are calling themselves the murder unit we have one group of individuals who fit the criteria or definition of a street gang he said they are organized and they are committing crimes we have recovered weapons guns he said its members are whites hispanics and african americans between the ages of 14 and 25 on the south fork mr dozier said he is seeing groups of youths in southampton and bridgehampton that are involved in drug trafficking and other low level crimes this is not a large group of the kids but there are always one or two trafficking drugs he said one rips off the next one and then everyone gets upset over the deal and it starts mr dozier said the youths sort of form packs for mutual protection each pack begins to protect their own turf he added repeated calls to the southampton town and southampton village police departments were not returned mr parks the assistant principal from east hampton said school officials have seen some gang graffiti but no further evidence of organized gangs the east hampton village police chief gerard larsen jr said sure there are wannabe gang members but we have n't seen any organized activities but detective john o'lever who heads suffolk 's gang intelligence unit made no such distinction geographically the east end towns are starting to see gang activity he said they have graffiti which is an indicator of gang activity they did n't have it a few years back
