 how about forcing the iraqi people to take out a mortgage on their newfound freedom using their nation 's future oil revenue as collateral a proposal to do that making a loan out of the 20 billion the bush administration is seeking to cover the first round of reconstruction costs is gaining support in congress of all the bad ideas that have been floated recently about iraq 's future this is one of the worst it is understandable that lawmakers from both parties are suffering sticker shock over president bush 's request for an additional 87 billion for postwar iraq and afghanistan the estimated costs of occupying and rebuilding iraq are skyrocketing while projections for foreign contributions and potential iraqi oil income keep shrinking but adding 20 billion to iraq 's current foreign debt is not the answer iraq already owes tens of billions to france russia and others much of which may have to be written off preferentially guaranteeing iraq 's debt to the united states for funds paid out to american contractors with future oil revenue would only reinforce suspicions around the world about our motives for going to war nor is it sensible economically baghdad may earn only about 10 billion from its oil sales next year and while iraq stands to make more than that in the longer term it is hard to see how the struggling country would be able to repay a 20 billion loan from washington the white house is scrambling to oppose the loan idea but its refusal to level with the american people over the past year about the true costs of the war and its aftermath only fed the notion that no great sacrifices lay ahead its vague talk about oil money 's covering much of the tab did little to prepare congress for the day of reckoning the 20 billion for reconstruction the administration is seeking is a down payment on an investment that could add up to 100 billion in coming years congressional demands for more specifics about how this money will be spent are appropriate but efforts to separate this request from the less controversial 65 billion for military operations are counterproductive lawmakers who overwhelmingly supported this war should face the responsibility for helping to build a stable and functional iraq eventually able to stand on its own right now building new roads and power plants in iraq is as essential to our national interest as paying for the training salaries and equipment of the men and women in the military forces in iraq the alternative moving to make the task just a bit cheaper by saddling the iraqi people with even more foreign debt is a recipe for fomenting resentful anti americanism it sounds more like a punitive versailles style approach to the vanquished instead of the marshall plan for the middle east that the white house keeps promising
