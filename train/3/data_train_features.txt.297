installations and the city of heidelberg mr schauble said at an evening news conference in the state capital stuttgart we have evidence that an attack was planned for sept 11 the anniversary of the attacks in the united states but there was no information released tonight that indicated whether the couple were in communication with the qaeda network or any other qaeda cell like the one in hamburg that carried out the sept 11 attacks heidelberg is the headquarters for the united states army in europe and for the army 's v corps about 16000 american military personnel their families and civilian employees live and work in the area a significant portion of the roughly 62000 american soldiers based in europe said col carl kropf chief spokesman for the united states army forces europe base employees like the woman arrested have special passes and can normally enter base facilities without extensive searches the plot if the allegations are proved would be one of the most serious efforts to attack american targets since the events of sept 11 the names of the two suspects were not released mr schauble said the man was a strict muslim who seems to be a follower of osama bin laden who is deeply religious and harbors a hatred for americans and jews the woman had also shown a hatred of jews mr schauble said the two were arrested at their apartment in walldorf the apartment contained 287 pounds of what were described as explosive chemicals and five pipe bombs mr schauble said that american investigators produced information that led to the arrest of the couple but colonel kropf and other american officials reached in germany tonight refused to comment further on the case saying that the suspects are under german jurisdiction german federal authorities working for the federal prosecutor kay nehm said tonight that they would not comment on the case which is being handled by the state authorities but they said they were following the investigation all american installations in germany have been on a high state of alert for some time senior european officials say they expect al qaeda to be planning new attacks on americans and american targets whether in the united states or around the world as the anniversary of the sept 11 attacks approaches they say they also expect qaeda sympathizers and cells cut off from central authority with osama bin laden and some of his leading lieutenants missing to try to operate on their own intelligence officials say american sites abroad are likely to be easier targets than those in the united states in what appeared to be an arrest not related to the explosives case an afghan born german citizen from hamburg was taken into custody in new york and is now being held in alexandria va the german federal prosecutor 's office announced today it said that the man 39 left germany for the united states in mid july and was arrested in mid august american officials told the germans that there was evidence that the man who was not publicly identified was planning terrorist attacks the german authorities said they began an investigation of the man on aug 20 on possible charges of membership in a terrorist organization earlier this week ulrich kersten chief of germany 's federal investigative agency said officials were sure that in europe and in germany there are people who are ready to commit violence in a jihad he said he could not rule out the existence of other qaeda cells in germany and elsewhere german authorities have opened investigations into at least 100 islamic militants who live in germany and who are suspected of having fought in afghanistan chechnya or bosnia or having been trained in terrorist camps in afghanistan some of the investigations are of turkish groups that want to overthrow the secular turkish government and that have no apparent connection to al qaeda but investigators worry that al qaeda is infiltrating or using other groups or that other groups are putting their assets and networks at its service germany has passed new laws to undercut some of its traditional protection of privacy to improve its ability to combat terrorist groups and sleeper cells who often used mosques as cover new laws allow the authorities to go after the finances of groups bent on terrorist attacks to prosecute hate speech even if it takes place in a mosque and to investigate people suspected of being members or supporters of terrorist groups heidelberg itself with a population of 130000 is a beautiful tourist spot with a famous university and an exquisite old town often visited by american sightseers tonight zdf television reported that an islamic center in heidelberg was thought to have helped to finance the qaeda attacks against the united states embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 according to the station the german authorities were investigating possible links between the islamic center and the turkish man they have arrested
