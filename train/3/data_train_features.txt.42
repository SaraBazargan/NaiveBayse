 it was only last sunday when the sun finally peeked out that my tomato plants stopped shivering and started to grow so i spent the afternoon putting cages around them imagining that they looked stronger at this show of confidence and planting basil all through their raised bed i do this not only because i love pesto but because i like to believe that basil enhances the tomatoes growth and flavor so do carrots supposedly but i ca n't grow a carrot in this clay soil to save my life companion planting or using one species to bolster the health or production of another has been part of garden folklore for centuries but proving what works which companion plants attract beneficial insects or repel pests and which enrich the soil is about as easy as finding a cure for the common cold it 's almost like the mind body connection if you believe that basil helps your tomatoes it will as arthur o tucker and thomas debaggio point out in the big book of herbs interweave press 2000 the idea was popularized in the united states in the 1940 's with the introduction of french intensive gardening rudolf steiner 's biodynamic principles paid similar attention to the soil and to the exchange of gases nutrients and compounds companion plants a 1943 pamphlet by richard b gregg and a book he wrote in 1966 with helen louise philbrick companion plants and how to use them devin adair 1990 were embraced by organic gardeners determined not to use pesticides and their monthly bible organic gardening magazine published frequent articles on the subject i know because i read the magazine cover to cover in the 1970 's when i first realized i did n't have to rely on the chemical arsenal my father used to grow broccoli i started growing more flowers and herbs right in the vegetable patch the goal long before biodiversity became a buzzword in the environmental movement was to attract beneficial insects though my favorite advice from the magazine was more mechanical than ecological vacuum flea beetles off the spinach in those days i followed the traditional combinations with near religious zeal i planted mint thyme and sage to repel the cabbage moth until the mint started overtaking my garden i sowed basil and borage to discourage the tomato hornworm though later i realized the parasitic wasp that deposited eggs inside the worm did a better job by simply having its larvae devour the hornworm from within and now i wonder if those borage flowers may have attracted the wasps in the first place sometimes i took trowel in hand the hornworms ultimate enemy companion i remember my remorse after killing the black and yellow striped caterpillar that was consuming my dill and parsley the larva of a black swallowtail butterfly i would never know i have also used companion plantings to divert and trap pests discarding the entire plant once heavily infested but then you wonder if you had n't planted that nasturtium for example to draw the aphids away from the broccoli and peppers would the aphids have simply avoided your garden in the first place one year i tried an american indian tradition known as three sisters planting scarlet runner beans up the stalks of sweet corn and letting acorn squash ramble beneath the stalks i had no damage that year from deer and thus believed what i had heard that deer do n't like to step among prickly vines but the food historian william weaver who grows heirloom vegetables in devon pa scoffed at that idea they eat squash believe me he said they love the tender buds corn a heavy nitrogen feeder can benefit from bean plants which take nitrogen from the air and move it to their roots where rhizobia a type of soil bacteria turn it into a form usable by not only the beans but also by other plants using the same soil but it is n't clear whether this is an immediate benefit or one that takes a while which would explain why farmers rotate their fields of corn and beans the traditions are many most unproven peas and carrots do well together but dill inhibits the growth of carrots summer savory helps the beans grow camomile enhances the flavor of cabbages cucumbers and onions robert kourick summed up a number of experiments in designing and maintaining your edible landscaping naturally metamorphic press 1986 one study for example indicated that tansy and catnip reduced colorado potato beetles on potatoes by more than 70 percent in another study catnip reduced green aphids on pepper plants by 91 percent marigold species not the hybrids discouraged nematodes but mr kourick concluded that it was less the one to one side by side effect of raising a certain plant next to another and more a matter of the general benefit of diverse plantings what 's fascinating to me is that in many cases the mechanism was the increase in predators or parasitic wasps mr kourick said last week from his home north of san francisco so it 's good to have a nice flower garden around your vegetables right and i 'm sure those nice flowers and herbs are playing very specific roles but i 'm always wondering which ones
