 racing the antelope what animals can teach us about running and life by bernd heinrich illustrated 292 pp new york cliff street books harpercollins publishers 23 bernd heinrich provides welcome relief from technological shut ins who run outdoors while wearing headphones such sensory invalids their aural blinders seem a violation of the essence of running which is a rustling of the unconfined no muffling hindrances for heinrich a zoologist whose previous nature writing earned a nomination for the national book award when he runs he seems to see and hear everything in sensurround the haunting cries of geese and the soaring wing beats of butterflies noted with the precision of a marathoner recording split times since he was 4 heinrich has been on the run from the russian advance into poland along sandy barefoot trails of postwar germany on a steamship across the atlantic through fields and around cinder tracks in high school and college and finally on a circling of concrete loops in chicago attempting to break the american record for the 100 kilometer 62 mile run it was this ultramarathon on oct 4 1981 that inspired his new book racing the antelope for him running has provided escape acceptance a measure of objective achievement beyond even the impartiality of science the quality of running can not be defined in terms of anyone 's use or place in a hierarchy or plan he writes the test is the race where credentials mean nothing and performances everything the book operates on several levels as a memoir natural history experimental training guide it has its weaknesses heinrich 's insights about running sometimes limp toward metaphor for life sentimentality and his knowledge of elite international competition seems as dated as the prototype sneakers that nike once fashioned with a waffle iron but there is an unfailing wonder in his writing that gives the book a transforming visual quality the overall effect is as if the boston marathon were being televised by the discovery channel by 41 heinrich had run the equivalent of four times around the earth but did he have the endurance to cover 62 miles a distance more than twice the length of a standard 262 mile marathon an enervating exercise that would require more than six and a half hours of continuous running he knew of no ultramarathon training manuals so he looked to nature could the evolutionary adaptations of other animals assist his own endurance nectar collecting bees because they do n't sweat regurgitate and spread over their bodies their stomach contents for evaporative cooling vultures can drop their body temperature as much as 36 degrees fahrenheit by excreting waste on their legs pronghorn antelopes always keep their mouths open when they run saving energy by curtailing the resistance of expelled air although unlike deer they have n't evolved the ability to make vertical jumps over fences dogs synchronize breathing with their strides reducing the amount of output required for inhalation and exhalation camels store in their fatty humps a source of concentrated food akin to power bars the champion runner is the american cockroach which can sprint on its hind two legs at a pace of 50 body lengths per second while heinrich offers page after page of fascinating biological adaptation he is less successful attempting to explain one of the more urgent questions of human endurance how athletes from the east african nation of kenya have come to dominate distance running he even lived for a time in neighboring tanzania and as a runner and a scientist he might have been expected to add a fresh voice to the discussion instead we get a cursory deliberation heinrich sides with the cultural argument as many do but by completely discounting altitude as a factor as he appears to he risks his credibility on the subject sea level performance is not increased by training at altitudes he writes a flat assertion that would be countered by many scientists and marathoners a majority of the world 's elite distance runners train at altitude for a period while preparing for sea level races in order to build up their oxygen carrying capacity in the thin air he also writes naively about performance enhancing drugs to say about distance running that on the whole it is honest is callow to be charitable in fact there is no way to know many believe the exact opposite is true suspicion of drug use is so rampant that the new york city marathon and other leading ones have called for blood testing at their events heinrich is engaging when he details his own training methods born of science quirky intuition and a willingness to subvert convention for instance he never stretched before a run because muscles deliver power only when pulled taut i 'd never heard of a yogi who was a great runner even socks would be too heavy to wear in an ultramarathon in running 62 miles he would take 124000 steps lifting an extra ounce of foot weight one inch higher than necessary on each stride would amount to lifting a 900 pound weight one foot off the ground he would have to glide close to the ground like an ostrich lifting his body only three inches with each step would result in a cumulative vertical distance of two miles punishing work an ultramarathoner can not double his body weight in fat for fuel like a migrating bird so heinrich had to find an efficient balance between short term carbohydrate energy for speed and fat metabolism for endurance one way to keep blood sugar levels up during a race is to absorb carbohydrates from the digestive tract heinrich experimented by gulping honey and olive oil and trained by eating a sandwich hamburger and fries and even a full meal immediately before a long run once he started a long race carrying three six packs of beer for carbo replenishing finally he settled on cranberry juice which like nectar is a diluted sugar solution the day of his big race having arrived heinrich set off to take the measure of his imagination an endurance predator on a symbolic communal hunt the human experience is populated with dreams and aspirations he writes for me the animal totem for these dreams is the antelope swift strong and elusive most of us chase after 'antelopes and sometimes we catch them often we do n't but why do we bother to try i think it is because without dream antelopes to chase we become what a lap dog is to a wolf and we are inherently more like wolves than lap dogs jere longman the author of the girls of summer covers running as a sportswriter for the times
