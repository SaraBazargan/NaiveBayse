 the united states war on drugs in colombia is rapidly being subsumed in the campaign against terror according to bush administration officials the indictments of three leaders of the marxist revolutionary armed forces of colombia or farc announced today in washington by the united states attorney general john ashcroft are just the latest in a series of american indictments against the leaders of the country 's two major insurgent groups carlos castano the head of the right wing self defense forces was indicted on drug trafficking charges in washington in september and four other men linked to the paramilitary group were indicted on drug related charges in houston this month the indictment unsealed today in federal court in washington accuses three farc military leaders including jorge briceno suarez widely considered the second most powerful man in the rebel organization of kidnapping and drug trafficking eight other lower ranking farc members were charged with the same offenses according to administration officials the indictments are part of a developing united states strategy of using the tactics of the drug war to help the new colombian government of president alvaro uribe to combat both the right wing paramilitaries and the marxist guerrillas who have been waging a 38 year civil conflict fueled primarily with drug money this is a two pronged approach said an aide to mr ashcroft we 're going after the drug traffickers and the terrorist groups at the same time the indictments are seen by the administration as the best and perhaps only way for washington to put direct pressure on the farc and the self defense forces known as the auc both groups are included on the administration 's list of terrorist organizations castano 's sins are many and multiple and they 're not just drug trafficking they 're also rape pillage and plunder said a high ranking bush administration official involved in shaping colombia policy in terms of crimes against the united states and us law drug trafficking is the most salient and the one we could get an indictment on the indictments also acknowledged implicitly that colombia 's justice system long criticized as weak and ineffectual could not be trusted to bring mr castano and his associates to trial since it is extremely unlikely that he would be prosecuted in colombia this indictment is a very positive step said jose miguel vivanco the director of the americas division for human rights watch which vigorously supported the drug indictments against the paramilitaries we should never forget they got al capone on tax evasion charges the new american tactics seem to be producing results even though mr castano and the farc leaders remain at large with little immediate prospect of their being arrested because it was singled out first by the bush administration the effects are most evident among the self defense forces a confederation with at least 12000 fighters that carries out mass killings and assassinations to erode support for the rebels the indictments have deepened divisions within the group paramilitary commanders in medellin and the surrounding countryside said in recent interviews as commanders weigh how involved in the drug trade their factions should remain they say that mr castano who has denied direct links to drug trafficking is trying to rein in those commanders who are heavily involved in it paramilitary commanders have long argued over the advisability of getting involved in the drug trade politically some felt it sent the wrong message for groups that were supposedly defending the law against left wing insurgents to be breaking the law themselves practically speaking many feared exactly what has happened that the involvement in drugs would make them vulnerable to prosecution the indictments have caused a very bad uneasiness among top paramilitary leaders said piolin a commander in medellin who works for adolfo paz who leads a powerful faction within the auc considered to have some of the closest ties to drug trafficking they worry that washington with its aggressive campaign against terrorism could take drastic action to capture or kill mr castano and other paramilitary commanders piolin said we are talking about the united states he added we are not talking about just any country infighting between commanders over the drug issue has become such a serious problem that two factions are openly fighting the paramilitary leaders say and alliances between others are in tatters in an interview in his mountain camp far outside medellin a top commander once closely allied to mr castano said that he and the 1500 men he leads in the so called metro bloc had split from the auc because they oppose the close ties other factions have with drug trafficking his group is openly fighting forces controlled by mr paz in the self defense forces the great majority are involved directly with narco trafficking said the commander who uses the alias rodrigo american officials are reluctant to claim credit for the new antiterror strategy or even to admit that it exists but they are clearly pleased with the unrest it has created if indeed the indictment had the impact of further splintering the auc and further calling into question the leadership of those who from our point of view are tied to drug trafficking so much the better the bush administration official said after the removal of congressional restrictions on american aid to antidrug programs the bush administration is also training specialized commando units and helping establish a reliable system of intelligence gathering that the units would use in pursuing insurgent commanders american troops will soon train a special 400 man commando unit that will track paramilitaries and rebels with an emphasis on hunting down leaders the american congress is also considering legislation to provide 5 million for the training of a colombian army unit dedicated to pursuing paramilitary chiefs those close to mr castano said the indictment had blindsided him because the paramilitaries have always viewed themselves as allies of the colombian army in their war against the rebels on his web site and in e mail messages to associates mr castano has called the indictment totally erroneous and charged that the rebels have manipulated the united states government in e mail messages to a confidant he has also expressed fears that the united states could bomb his camp
