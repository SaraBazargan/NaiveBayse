 as a guidance counselor at lincoln high school for four years i am deeply disturbed by the article on lincoln turning lincoln around march 12 while lincoln has experienced considerable disruption this year staff and students are also actively engaged in meaningful education daily teachers have been working toward meeting the new educational standards and students are working toward and achieving their goals of high school graduation and higher education however from the opening paragraph the article made it clear that the intended picture of lincoln was purely negative the article referred to last year 's school day which ended at 12 30 pm because it was tailored to meet the teachers needs not the students according to the superintendent of schools in fact last year all ninth graders had classes through the end of eighth period 2 10 pm most but not all upperclassmen had classes periods one through seven and lunch eighth period which allowed them to leave for the day at 1 25 pm the remaining upperclassmen had an early lunch and an eighth period class the teachers day was from 7 45 am to 2 15 pm and many stayed later to work with students it was reasonable to refer to the teachers strike last fall but the student reaction took place at all four high schools not just at lincoln and the staff members who were injured were not hurt by students but in an incident where students were not even present the principal referred to students who have been at lincoln for seven years presumably this is true but as a guidance counselor responsible for 21 percent of the student body for four years i have never had a student who remained at lincoln for six much less seven years in the entire article just 18 lines discussed the positive side there was no mention of the students taking advanced placement classes no mention of the students who struggle to work 30 hour weeks and yet maintain their academics only a brief reference to the fact that over 70 percent of the students who took the english regents exam in january passed and no mention that of the juniors the number was closer to 80 percent perhaps the most destructive and misleading statement was a quote from the vice president of the school board mr weibrecht said when we have children in high school who are n't reading it begs the question how did that kid get here he goes on to imply that teachers are to blame for this i however can vividly recall the eight years i spent as an elementary school counselor when each year teachers would ask that students be held back usually in the primary grades because they needed more time to catch up the answer was always the same central administration would not allow any students to be retained thus students without the basic skills necessary to move on to higher levels were repeatedly pushed up anyway i hope that future articles will discuss in more detail the positive things happening at lincoln and the accomplishments of our students however this article has already done its damage worst of all for our students most of whom are terrific kids who do n't realize just how good they are this article will simply reinforce their already low self esteem susan bryant larchmont
