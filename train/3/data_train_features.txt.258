 brushing aside objections from labor advocates and human rights campaigners the world trade organization formally agreed today to hold the group 's next top level meeting in autumn in doha the capital of the persian gulf state of qatar the meeting 's dates will be set next month the doha meeting is the subject of increasing international attention because momentum is building for a proposal to begin a new multiyear round of global trade talks there the big industrial countries of western europe generally favor starting the new round which had been scheduled to start at the last major meeting in seattle in december 1999 that meeting drew unexpectedly disruptive street protests and talks never got off the ground partly because of american insistence that environmental and labor standards two major concerns of the antiglobalization protesters be included in the new trade round european union officials met with more than a dozen countries in geneva today to explore the feasibility of restarting the process in doha after remarks by the european commission president romano prodi at the world economic forum in davos last week that he hoped talks could begin later this year a spokesman for the european union said its officials would like to sound out developing countries about the feasibility of a new round but the union would prefer to establish a separate forum for discussion of the relationship between trade and social development issues to permit the trade talks to proceed unburdened by the kinds of disputes seen at the seattle meeting the choice of doha as a site was made by a consensus of the 140 nation trade organization and widely backed by the developing nations who predominate in the group but it drew criticism partly because of authoritarian qatar 's human rights record and the difficulty of organizing protests there on anything like the scale of those in seattle in response officials in qatar have pledged to allow unfettered access to the country during the conference and to permit demonstrations a rare sight in the conservative country as long as they are peaceful the nongovernmental organizations accredited to the seattle meeting will also be accredited to doha said mike moore the director general of the wto correction february 1 2001 thursday a picture caption in world business yesterday with an article about the selection of qatar 's capital for a top level meeting of the world trade organization gave an erroneous identification from agence france presse for the official shown he was sheik hamad bin jassim bin jabr al thani foreign minister of qatar not sheik hamad bin khalifa al thani the emir
