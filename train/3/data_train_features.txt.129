 party of the people a history of the democrats by jules witcover 826 pages random house 35 with the exception of the british tories the democrats are the oldest political party in the world in existence for more than 200 years jules witcover columnist for the baltimore sun has been covering politics for about a quarter of that time in party of the people he surveys the democratic story from the days of thomas jefferson and james madison to the second gulf war during its long life the democratic party has changed its name confusingly for us jefferson and madison called themselves republicans to distinguish themselves from the monarchical tendencies they saw in the washington administration the founders used democrats almost as a cuss word savoring of radicalism and anarchy it was not until andrew jackson that jefferson 's heirs adopted the label the party has outlived numerous rivals in the 19th century the federalists of alexander hamilton and john adams and the whigs of henry clay and daniel webster became extinct the populists hijacked the democratic party then vanished in the 20th century die hard southerners bolted first under strom thurmond then under george wallace so did hard leftists under henry wallace in presidential contests the democrats have carried as many as 46 states and as few as 1 through all these vicissitudes mr witcover writes the party has pursued a commitment to social and economic justice that marked its earliest days this is a big subject and party of the people covers it unevenly at the start mr witcover 's survey of the decades before the civil war is slight and biased presenting all non democrats as mere agents of the rich how the virginia planters jefferson and madison turned the illegitimate immigrant hamilton into an aristocrat is one of the great spin operations of american political history at the end mr witcover 's account of the clinton years is remarkably evenhanded sure to displease both ann coulter and joe conason but there is little profit in repeating what no adult has forgotten mr witcover does best with the century from appomattox to john f kennedy this was the era of early modern politics of newspapers not television of bosses machines and contested presidential conventions whose end coincided with the beginning of mr witcover 's journalistic career he has combed the history books diligently and he has retrieved many vivid quotations which stand out from the marsh of his own prose when rutherford b hayes a republican ran for president in 1876 boasting of his honesty after the corruption of the grant administration the publisher joseph pulitzer said hayes has never stolen good god has it come to this in 1894 ben tillman a democrat from south carolina called president grover cleveland the leader of his own party an old bag of beef adding i am going to washington with a pitchfork and prod him in his old fat ribs william jennings bryan the nebraska democrat who won his party 's presidential nomination in 1896 when he was only 36 was known as the boy orator of the platte half a century later the republican thomas dewey another youthful presidential candidate had an altogether different persona he was known as the boy orator of the platitude in 1956 yet another youngster senator john f kennedy sought the vice presidential nomination the house speaker sam rayburn was not impressed calling him that little pissant the weakness of mr witcover 's storytelling is a cartoonish focus on the moment that leaves the reader wondering how individuals and voting blocs change for good or ill he praises the democrats for the practicality and idealism they have shown since jefferson 's day in appealing to recent immigrants yet when he comes to write of the scandals associated with tammany hall in new york he accuses boss tweed its leader of relying on the votes of easily manipulated immigrants daniel patrick moynihan would have known how to balance the outreach and the manipulation mr witcover simply shuffles the two ideas like cards he praises bryan 's 1896 campaign for electrifying the common people of the rural south and west thirty years later when bryan and these same people oppose the presidential ambitions of al smith the roman catholic new yorker they have become censorious rubes supporting prohibition as the centerpiece of their war against sin mr witcover who lives with all of us in the midst of a modern drug war might look at the prohibitionists with a shock of recognition and empathy he understands his republican foils no better than he understands his democratic heroes and this failure drains his book of drama his credo for the democratic party was foreshadowed by the young bryan when he urged it to choose the have nots over the haves on one side stand the corporate interests of the nation its moneyed institutions its aggregations of wealth and capital imperious arrogant compassionless they demand special legislation favors privileges immunities on the other side stands the unnumbered throng which gave a name to the democratic party and for which it has assumed to speak work worn and dust begrimed they make their mute appeal bryan 's opponent in 1896 william mckinley made an equally fervent statement of the archetypal republican position all attempt to array class against class the classes against the masses section against section labor against capital poor against rich or interest against interest is in the highest degree reprehensible over the years each major party has betrayed its ideals even at the level of oratory so often as to make these earnest statements almost embarrassing yet they are not mere boilerplate they do capture fundamental truths about the populist and nationalist yin and yang of our politics a book sensitive to the energies swirling about these two poles would be gripping lacking that sensitivity party of the people is a donkey and elephant show with donkeys in the spotlight political enthusiasts and toastmasters for jefferson jackson day dinners will be able to mine this book for useful material other readers would be better off buying a good general history of the united states books of the times richard brookhiser is a senior editor of national review
