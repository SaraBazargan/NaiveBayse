 wolfgang holzmair baritone austrian cultural forum the austrian baritone wolfgang holzmair has an extraordinary way of addressing you directly and intensely when he is singing in a regular concert hall so the tiny space of the auditorium at the austrian cultural forum could bring him little benefit when he performed there on friday evening with russell ryan at the piano there may even have been disadvantages in that both artists had to restrain themselves and in that so few people 60 or so were able to hear mr holzmair in unusual repertory most certainly there was a big disadvantage in philipp harnoncourt 's staged installation a hesitant sequence of projections presenting images and sometimes the text for color and atmosphere one needed only mr holzmair 's singing for words too he being such a master of diction and inflection he began with schoenberg 's cycle the book of the hanging gardens the work in which sensuous festering poems by stefan george became the vehicle for early atonal wanderings often sung by sopranos who easily seem to inhabit the spiritualized air of the music more than the jungle of the poetry beneath the piece here became a union of word and sound for mr holzmair singing is the best way of speaking poetry he seemed in the thick of george 's troubled solitary desire and that way he was in the thick too of the music 's transcription of spurts of feeling and deadened lack of feeling five morike songs by wolf continuing on from the schoenberg george with no break gradually drew back or forward to self certainty and pleasure in life while giving mr holzmair abundant further opportunities to show his sensitivity to words in the sudden brightness of erstaunt for example contrasting with the velvety enclosure of anschaun he ended with der abschied from the song of the earth which does not sound well on the piano that however did not stop him from suggesting the same anxious personality moving through planes of hope to arrive not as usual at release but at a question paul griffiths
