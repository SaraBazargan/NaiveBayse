 meteorite mystery on the long transit from earth to moon the apollo spacecraft were put into what was known as barbecue mode a slow rotation so that no part of the ship got too hot from exposure to sunlight a rock in space like a fragment knocked off one asteroid in a collision with another in the belt between mars and jupiter does not normally roll like a rack of ribs on a rotisserie spit so one side gets more sunlight than the other and gives off more heat in return this difference the russian engineer i o yarkovsky suggested a century ago can be enough to cause the rock to drift slightly in its orbit scientists in italy and the czech republic have now used this yarkovsky effect to explain one of the remaining mysteries of how some of those asteroid fragments travel all the way to earth where they become meteorites it has long been known that asteroid fragments in two narrow orbital bands can under the gravitational effects of jupiter and saturn be kicked out of the asteroid belt and head toward earth but this supposes that only a few asteroids situated on the edges of these bands which are known as resonance gaps produce the fragments and the numbers do not add up a few asteroids are not enough to produce the number of fragments that hit earth using computer modeling the scientists found an explanation in the yarkovsky effect a fragment from a far off asteroid they reported in the journal nature can slowly drift into one of the resonance gaps due to the differential heating enough of these rocks can drift in this way to explain the number of meteorites hitting earth and the phenomenon also explains the age of many meteorites as measured by cosmic ray exposure they have been drifting for millions of years before entering the resonance gap rather than quickly entering from nearby 'a space odyssey rerun nasa 's promised rethinking of its faster cheaper better strategy for exploring mars instituted after the loss of two spacecraft last year has already brought some changes in the way the agency is pursuing future missions the most notable being a total review of all missions in the works which has resulted in delays and cancellations for some but in addition to rethinking nasa has been engaged in some renaming never one to pass up a chance to increase the appeal of its projects to the general public the agency announced last week that the mission formerly known as mars surveyor 2001 would now be known as 2001 mars odyssey in honor of the book and film 2001 a space odyssey the renaming follows a decision in may amid all the rethinking to eliminate a lander portion of the mission the 2001 mars odyssey will now consist only of an orbiter to be launched next april it will carry instruments to detect the planet 's surface composition any water or shallow buried ice and radiation nasa has since announced a plan to send two landers to mars in 2003 a gold rush legacy the california gold rush may be long over but the environmental and ecological effects remain more than 150 years after james marshall first found flakes of gold at sutter 's mill the latest evidence for this is a study by scientists with the united states geological survey of mercury contamination of fish in the sierra nevadas mercury is a potent neurotoxin and it accumulates in the food chain during the gold rush millions of pounds of mercury were used to extract gold from its ore it is still used this way in some developing countries much of the mercury was lost to the environment the federal researchers found that bass and other fish from two watersheds in former gold mining areas showed significant levels of mercury in their tissues the researchers have given their data to state health officials who can decide whether to issue a public advisory against eating certain fish from these areas
