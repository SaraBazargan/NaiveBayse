 making schools work a revolutionary plan to get your children the education they need by william g ouchi simon schuster this ambitious book wants to do no less than show parents and educators how to revolutionize their schools dr ouchi a professor of management at the university of california at los angeles and an expert in organizational structure set out to study what characteristics made one school district successful and another failing he chose six school systems three centralized top down new york city los angeles and chicago and three successful seattle houston and edmonton canada from this experience dr ouchi developed seven keys to success which he skillfully illustrates through descriptions of some of the 223 public and independent schools he and his research team visited while details vary the overall pattern is simple bad schools fail largely because of too much district oversight and micromanaging great schools have entrepreneurial principals who are in complete control including of their own budgets dr ouchi found his holy grail in edmonton which decentralized three decades ago the other districts he deemed successful including well regarded district 2 in manhattan were emulating edmonton and shifting more authority to individual schools in particular dr ouchi author of the best selling theory z how american business can meet the japanese challenge shows how schools could have the funds they need to improve if they controlled their own budgets this is an important argument given the debate over financing schools in disadvantaged communities there 's one problem dr ouchi occasionally ignores evidence that hurts his argument take houston the texas miracle has been crumbling lately nowhere more so than in houston which turns out to have drastically understated dropout rates this ca n't be a surprise to dr ouchi since he did n't believe what houston told him in the first place his own calculations showed that just 45 percent of its first graders graduate from high school a figure close to those found in a recent state audit and he admits that reading and math scores are below the national average even so he writes that improvements in student achievement are dramatic to the point of straining the limits of credibility but they 're true the numbers hardly justify such praise so why does dr ouchi consider houston a success story because it 's decentralizing he is so convinced good things will follow that he allows himself to believe they already have that said he does visit individual houston schools that seem to be succeeding the book 's greatest value is not its reform plan anyway it is insights into understanding what is really going on in schools teachers and administrators weigh in on what to look for elementary classrooms should be stuffed with books teachers should be working with a few students not lecturing at the entire class principals should give you a tour of classrooms a principal who prefers just to walk down the hall is one of the most telling signs that things are n't right making schools work may not lead to a revolution as dr ouchi hopes but it explains what is good and bad about schools with sound ideas on how to improve them timothy a hacsi
