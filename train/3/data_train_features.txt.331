 what time is it there was shown as part of the 39th new york film festival in 2001 here are excerpts from elvis mitchell 's review which appeared in the new york times on sept 29 the full text is available at nytimescom the film in mandarin taiwanese and french with english subtitles opens today in manhattan what time is it there the newest film from the taipei director tsai ming liang may be one of the most unusual in some time this work certainly stands alone among cinematic achievements this year mr tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare unchecked heartache of yasujiro ozu but mr tsai has devised a storytelling style here that is both a natural evolution of his previous filmmaking and his most fully realized directing to date with scenes that also combine the seemingly disparate methods of ozu robert bresson and jacques tati in finding his own way mr tsai sets loose shock waves of comedy which both unleash a wave of euphoria in the audience and communicate the pleasure he gets from filmmaking yet the huge laughs do n't come at the expense of the deeply moving scenario which is reminiscent of a barely tapped genre the absurdist melodrama something we need now more than ever like the characters that people ozu 's filmography a group of people in time look for the connection of family and are stupefied by their inability to connect it begins with a wordless tableau in which a man miao tien his face sagging with misery walks into a room and slumps into a chair exhaling doleful plumes of smoke from his cigarettes he turns out to be the father of the household which never recovers from his death his son hsiao kang lee kang sheng is stuck in a house where his distraught mother lu yi ching is watching for signs of her husband 's reincarnation hsiao kang makes his living selling watches on the streets of taipei although he derides his mother for clinging to the possibility of an otherworldly sign he holds on to a dual time wristwatch that may have some connection to his departed father a determined customer chen shiang chyi hectors him into selling her the watch she 's going to paris and ca n't wait for him to order another of the same make she brings him a cake in gratitude for relenting and his world is never the same he becomes obsessed with resetting every clock he sees in stores movie theaters and a huge public clock atop a building to paris time his tenuous connection to her perhaps it is also his way of reaching out to the watch and what it represented mr tsai 's confidence as a filmmaker has grown and is in full flower here time has depths that the river his last collaboration with miao tien suggested mr tsai has noted that seeing time after the river will add to the levels of ambiguity that unite the two stylistically the bloom on the jokes in the frame is beguiling since he plants the camera and allows the action to unfold at its own pace he never moves the camera and he traps the actors and the tension inside each frame every scene plays out with a different rhythm and pops with the startling surprise of a perfect tag the stillness mr tsai uses here displays his newly deepened trust in his actors ms chen never makes a wrong move so in tune is she with the alienation and desire time requires she has a wonderful scene that crystallizes the theme of miscommunication with jean pierre leaud who has n't been this well used since his cameo in the marvelous vie de boheme which had a similar cool hand freakishness mr lee is one of the most gifted straight men in movies his bright swift takes are an apt contrast to the flintiness in the early scene of his dad mr lee 's reactions grow out of his steadily increasing bewilderment he also matches up with the bold businesslike hurt of ms lu who moves decisively in fashioning a home her dead husband will feel safe returning to it 's her only mission mr tsai may not have been reaching for it but he and his co screenwriter yang pi ying labor in a nouvelle vague version of a strindberg sitcom it 's a film about characters marooned in their own skins who can not communicate with the most important people in their worlds this director is also destiny 's child he benefits from some of the best luck ever to befall a filmmaker a scene featuring a cockroach and a pet fish with a huge off white noggin is worth the entire film the most intoxicatingly perverse scene in films this year it sets a benchmark others will ape in trying to create a plangent comic reality the mordantly beautiful cinematography by benoit delhomme complements rather than overstates the action in what time is it there a question that also refers to the world that hsiao kang 's father may now inhabit the quotidian serenity is continually broken by dottiness and the camera never blinks mr tsai has the patience not to cut away after a joke he makes the camera an impartial unshakable observer he not only gives the audience a chance to breathe but also lets us luxuriate in the mood of deadpan melancholy his movie evokes so beautifully
