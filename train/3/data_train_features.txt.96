 lucy and linus van pelt 's younger brother rerun does n't enjoy riding on the back of his mother 's bicycle she 's not that great a driver but he tries to keep a cheerful attitude over hill over dale he says brightly poor dale rerun is the central character in the newest peanuts television special i want a dog for christmas charlie brown tonight on abc he should have his agent complain to the producers about his material it 's not that i want a dog does n't have a lot of the bittersweet charm of the charles m schulz newspaper comic strip since schulz 's death in 2000 it has continued in its own kind of reruns peanuts classics the problem is that this one hour film feels like a hodgepodge of four frame strips strung together in an unsuccessful attempt to create a unified story that may well be exactly the structure we 're dealing with since bill melendez and lee mendelson schulz 's longtime collaborators have vowed to create new specials by working exclusively from the strip the plot is supposed to be about rerun 's christmas wish for his own dog since charlie brown wo n't sell his pet snoopy for less than 10 million and rerun has only 16 cents in the beginning rerun tries to play with snoopy a lot which he figures is the next best thing to dog ownership but his play demands become so overwhelming that snoopy begins responding to his invitations with form letter rejections then snoopy 's brother spike who lives alone in the southwest writes that he 's coming to visit and rerun decides he 'll adopt spike upon arrival but the plot is easy to lose sight of as unrelated stories often separate the dog scenes from one another and the repeated one two three punch line structure gives the show an undesirable mini sketch rhythm sally struggling with boots mittens and zippers concludes i was n't made for winter next she tries a flight on snoopy 's ace airline and complains hey i thought that passengers were always served a nice lunch that one has to be from a very old strip lucy persists in her attempts to make schroeder the piano prodigy fall in love with her he assures her that beethoven his idol never had women hanging around while he practiced and more than once schroeder gets rid of lucy by catapulting her off his piano never fall in love with a musician she concludes snoopy dresses up as santa claus and traumatizes a little girl when she sees santa eating from a dog dish charlie brown recalls the time snoopy 's others brother visited and trashed snoopy 's nicely furnished doghouse as if they were rock stars lucy signs up rerun to be in the christmas play and the thing ends abruptly with a charlie brown comment on closing credits luckily the individual strips will regain their playful poignancy when someone takes them apart we 'll still have rerun at the breakfast table bemoaning the three part fate he has just realized how could anyone not have a dog or a trust fund or grape jelly i want a dog for christmas charlie brown abc tonight at 8 eastern and pacific times 7 central time created by charles m schulz directed by bill melendez and larry leichliter produced by mr melendez lee mendelson executive producer edited by warren taylor music by vince guaraldi and david benoit arranged and performed by mr benoit animation by eddy houchins shawn cashman and david brain with the voices of jimmy bennett rerun adam taylor gordon charlie brown ashley rose orr lucy corey padnos linus hannah leigh dworkin sally nick price schroeder jake miner pig pen and franklin kaitlyn maggio little girl and bill melendez snoopy
