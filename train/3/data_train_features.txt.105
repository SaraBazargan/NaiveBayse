 charging that a large shipment of plutonium from nuclear weapons may be on its way to permanent storage in his state rather than to the temporary stay needed for processing gov jim hodges has ordered the south carolina highway patrol to draw up plans for blocking the state 's borders to federal trucks bearing it mr hodges says the bush administration has reneged on a plan worked out by the clinton administration to move the plutonium out of the savannah river site near aiken sc after it is converted to power plant fuel or encased in glass without a guarantee that the radioactive material will eventually be moved out of the state he said in an interview today he will do whatever it takes to keep it from coming in i 'll stand squarely in front of the trucks if that 's what it takes to protect the health and safety of our people he said in the meantime we 've got a range of options including roadblocks we are not going to be stuck with permanent storage of plutonium in our state in a memorandum released by his office mr hodges ordered b boykin rose the state 's public safety director to evaluate options for highway roadblocks a step that recalls gov cecil d andrus 's use of the idaho state police in 1988 to block shipments of nuclear waste from the navy to a processing plant in his state mr hodges said a federal lawsuit was another option being considered the energy department which operates the savannah river site a nuclear processing and disposal complex said it hoped to continue discussing the issue with south carolina officials to prevent confrontations at the border joe davis a spokesman for the department said secretary of energy spencer abraham promised on a visit to the complex this week that the plutonium would not be permanently stored in south carolina we 're committed to making sure that the materials that come into the state leave the state mr davis quoted mr abraham as saying but mr hodges said that he was not satisfied with vague assurances and that he had not been given a detailed plan on how the waste will be removed if the government moves to south carolina all the plutonium that requires processing he said it will leave the state isolated because no other state will want the material back we will be left holding the proverbial bag the governor wrote in his memorandum the two sides can not even agree on when the first shipment of more than 50 tons of plutonium from rocky flats the shuttered colorado nuclear weapons complex will enter south carolina on its way to the savannah river site about 20 miles downstream from augusta ga mr hodges said he believed that the trucks would begin coming in two weeks but mr davis said there would be no shipments until this fall the plutonium at issue was left over from the production of nuclear weapons in 1996 the united states and russia agreed to take equal amounts out of their nuclear stockpiles and either convert it to fuel for nuclear power plants or encase it in radioactive glass to keep it from being stolen but in may citing budget pressures the bush administration said it would not yet begin the expensive process of stabilizing the plutonium and encasing it in glass instead officials said waste will be stored in containers at the south carolina complex while the issue is studied further that infuriated mr hodges who said the state had contributed enough to the nation 's nuclear program by allowing savannah river to manufacture plutonium and tritium gas for bombs as far back as 1952 the state has no intention of being the storage site for warhead waste he said suggesting that it be stored instead in a state with many remote locations like nevada the end of the cold war allowed the government to shut down the original five reactors at the 310 square mile savannah river complex and now the only plutonium manufactured there is used as batteries for space probes but the site still plays an important role in storing and processing spent fuel and other waste the cost of processing the plutonium has grown sharply however precisely at a time when the bush administration is looking for ways to cut the budget of most agencies including the energy department a confidential report from the department made public on thursday by the private nuclear control institute said the cost of the 22 year plutonium disposal program that resulted from the agreement with the russians had now risen to 66 billion a 50 percent increase over a 1999 estimate mr hodges a democrat said politics did not play a role in his stand and added that he did not believe his state was being made a target for waste because he is a democrat at a time when republicans are in the white house this afternoon in fact one of his most bitter political enemies state attorney general charlie condon a republican issued a strong statement of support for his position pledging to work with him to keep the government from forcing the state to accept nuclear waste
