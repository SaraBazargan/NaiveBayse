 once again kenyans have found themselves caught in the middle of a war that is not their own television images broadcast throughout kenya today showed the charred remains of a building brought down by a bomb a frantic search and rescue effort and victims carried away to hospitals and the morgue the attack on the paradise hotel in the coastal resort city of mombasa was eerily reminiscent of the even deadlier attack four years ago on the united states embassy in the capital nairobi in both cases innocent kenyans made up the bulk of the casualties in both cases as well it appeared that kenya was the venue but that the driving force was international politics that had little to do with east africa mombasa is home to most of kenya 's muslims who generally mix easily with the majority christians especially when the situation there is compared with that of kenya 's strife ridden neighbor sudan as well as a beach paradise the city is a bustling port linking kenya to the middle east mombasa 's islamic culture is strong with some streets emptying out at prayer time and islamic dress commonplace just as in nigeria muslims in mombasa spoke out against the miss world pageant calling on miss kenya not to take part but after issuing their statement mombasa 's muslims largely stayed quiet the latest bombing aimed at israelis is sure to increase calls among some kenyans for their country one of america 's staunchest military allies in africa to distance itself from the policies of washington after the sept 11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon last year president daniel arap moi of kenya whom the united states has criticized for his autocratic ways but embraced for his consistent backing of american policies marched down the street in a show of support the gesture was intended to counter muslim protests in nairobi in which the united states was denounced as evil when muslims marched in the direction of the israeli embassy in nairobi mr moi dispatched security forces to break up the demonstrations and stationed full time soldiers at the embassy 's front gate the relationship between the united states and kenya especially when it comes to military matters is close the american military operated from kenya during the 1991 persian gulf war and again during the ill fated relief mission in somalia in 1994 german and british surveillance planes supporting the united states led campaign against terrorism are currently using mombasa as a base as they search the seas off somalia for any fleeing qaeda operatives islamic leaders based along kenya 's coast have spoken out publicly against such operations as have some victims of the embassy bombing in 1998 which killed 12 americans and 247 kenyans ambassador johnnie carson and others in the american embassy in kenya have worked in recent months to soothe tensions between the united states and kenya 's large muslim population american diplomats have shown up regularly at cultural festivals and sponsored town meetings in recent months the united states has also provided money to train kenya 's airport workers in security screening and to upgrade equipment at airports the united states has also spent millions of dollars rebuilding structures in nairobi that were damaged in the 1998 embassy blast and paid medical bills for wounded kenyans and school fees for victims families but the compensation given to kenyans was nowhere near as generous as that offered by congress to the families of the americans who died in the sept 11 attacks in the united states and lawsuits have been filed by kenyans to gain more assistance only if americans are superior victims can the disparity explained paul wala chairman of a survivors association said at a recent news conference i was just walking down the street and america 's foreign policies caused me to get knocked down and hurt another victim said recently i had nothing to do with it with today 's attack at mombasa more kenyans have fallen victim in a global war in which they were not fighting
