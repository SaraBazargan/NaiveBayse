 jimmy fleming has pinpoint vision and short term memory problems his right hand shakes involuntarily he also has a sense of humor and a desire to share his story that story is about his bicycle accident on july 10 1985 mr fleming then 10 years old was out riding with a friend on his way to get some ice cream when he was hit by a car he flew up in the air as high as the telephone wires fell on the windshield and flipped over the back of the car landing on his head mr fleming was in a coma for 16 weeks and was totally blind for two years if he had worn a helmet his head injuries would have been far less severe which is why mr fleming who lives in pleasantville has spent the last five years going to schools boy scout and girl scout meetings and other places where children gather around westchester county promoting helmet safety for bicyclists skateboarders rollerbladers and skiers part lecture part stand up mr fleming 's 20 minute program resembles something you might see on the david letterman show it 's my way of lightening the mood a little said mr fleming who recently took his act to the northern westchester center for the arts where he studies theater quite frankly without a sense of humor my life would have been miserable q you interject jokes into your program have you been criticized for this a no i never make jokes about head injuries or undermine the importance of wearing helmets there 's nothing funny about these things at all i enjoy making people laugh i always have even before the accident my feeling is that if i just stood up and said to the kids you should wear your helmet because it reduces the risk of head injuries by 85 percent or it 's the law they 'd listen and say ok whatever when they hear me talk about my experience they appreciate the fact that i 'm not cynical or bitter and that i have a sense of humor in spite of it all the kids have remarked to me you have such courage and strength i get strength from hearing that q what sort of things do you talk about during your program a at one school i asked the kids to close their eyes for five minutes i asked them to keep them closed and do n't open them when five minutes was up i said now you can open your eyes i asked them what they saw they said nothing i told them that that is what i saw for two years i also tell them to look up at the telephone wires for a minute i say to them that is how high up i was when i was thrown from my bicycle that makes a big impact on them i like to talk about things that scare them then it will mean something q how do you know you 're making an impact on these kids a several years ago i went to the grand union with my dad he said to me jimmy wait right here i 'm waiting for my dad and this kid comes running up to me he told me he was in a bike accident a few weeks ago he said that if he had n't heard my talk he probably would n't have been wearing a helmet he wanted to thank me when i think about my accident i realize there are a few negatives but i also realize there are some positives hearing things like what this boy said are the positives q talk about this talent you have with letters and numbers a i honestly do n't know where that came from it happened after my brain was injured i can identify the letters of the alphabet by their numbers so anytime people tell me their names i see them in their number form i can do this automatically without even thinking about it i do this at the schools and the kids love it q people are constantly saying to you how do you keep your spirits up what do you say to that a my mom said that to me a lot after the accident she said jimmy how do you do it you make it so easy on me i say i just consider the alternative
