end of next year according to one study by the university of california at berkeley has left a newly minted newly unemployed leisure class gone are the all nighters in offices accessorized with sleeping cots common now are languid days in coffee shops unhurried travel to exotic destinations like tasmania and evenings out at jazz clubs and theme bars which have never been so numerous or popular many club owners and patrons say perhaps because the recently downsized are still living off severance packages or savings from the fat times there does not seem to be a great deal of despair over their unemployed status they are turning up at a wave of new clubs like lord of balls a lounge in japantown with a kitsch hunting lodge theme bliss in noe valley a red draped lounge that is packed on monday nights unusual for this city and g an unexpectedly hip bar in an otherwise quiet neighborhood of multimillion dollar homes near pacific heights that 's where ms st john 35 was

group that puts artists in touch with patrons willing to help support them i have my electric guitar my drums my video camera he said i find ways to noodle with my downtime local news articles have documented how soaring rents in the neighborhoods south of market street driven by the arrival of hundreds of internet companies in recent years pushed out artists and working class families in the wake of the internet bust which has disproportionately affected these small e commerce start ups the first signs of a reversal of the tide have appeared real estate agencies are reporting a slight weakening in the price of rental apartments i guess if there can be any silver lining to the recent downturn it would be that the artists forced out by the dot com invasion are returning mr george said everybody 's out of work and they 're ok with that people are getting back to what they believe in at the same time he acknowledged that the unstructured time he now has is not all carefree the downtime is fun but it can be stressful at the same time he said even for new economy workers who are still employed the slackening of the frenetic pace in their industry has allowed many it seems to pursue more personal sometimes bohemian interests gil silberman a lawyer whose specialty is emerging high tech companies realized a long held dream when he opened butterfly a jazz club with his wife norie he said his clientele includes many dot commers who suddenly have time to lift their heads from their computers and groove to be bop riffs people have been waiting for the internet to stumble

kentfield calif coined the phrase sudden wealth syndrome to describe the psychological impact of the high tech fast lane one of the institute 's directors stephen goldbart jokes that lately he has become an expert on its opposite sudden loss of wealth syndrome we have just come through this amazing growth cycle with very young people coming into oodles of money and that 's fun as long as that show is playing dr goldbart said but now we 're seeing a very different picture it 's a time for the diversifying of the psychological portfolio a time to think about having greater balance between work and other needs still he acknowledged that being out of work eventually will take a toll in stress not to mention financial difficulties these people may be in a bit of denial if they are not concerned about getting work he said but remember one thing it was that kind of optimism that has governed the psychology of wealth and the psychology of this economy that optimism may take them farther than any nose to the grindstone thinking ever would
