 in an important ruling upholding free speech rights under the first amendment the supreme court this week overturned a pernicious law passed by congressional republicans to handcuff and muzzle the lawyers who represent poor people in civil cases under the federally financed legal services program by a 5 to 4 vote the court ruled that congress violated the first amendment in 1996 when it restricted the kinds of arguments that legal services lawyers may make on behalf of welfare clients the restrictions were imposed as part of a compromise after congressional republicans came perilously close to eliminating the legal services program altogether the law the republicans pushed through five years ago allowed poverty lawyers whose offices receive federal money to seek benefits on behalf of individual clients but it barred them from bringing litigation lobbying or participating in any rule making proceeding in an effort to challenge or amend welfare laws or regulations that circumscribing of the legal services that could be provided was what the court overruled this week writing for the majority justice anthony kennedy strongly seconded the reasoning used by a federal appeals court in new york two years ago when it struck down the provision on the grounds that its attempt to discourage challenges to the status quo amounted to impermissible viewpoint discrimination under the first amendment but justice kennedy went beyond that earlier decision and complained that the restriction distorted the whole legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys and by trying to insulate the government 's laws from judicial inquiry lawyers must be free to make all reasonable arguments he said and courts must be free to consider all arguments the court 's affirmation of first amendment values could have broad implications for other government efforts to curb free expression in programs financed by public money the decision could for example provide a basis for cultural and artistic institutions to resist efforts by politicians to censor the material they can display or perform if they receive public funding new york city 's mayor rudolph giuliani who seems to come up with a new legal strategy to cut back on taxpayer support for the brooklyn museum whenever he is offended by some of the art it displays would be wise to take the decision 's free speech stance to heart disappointingly the court did not seize the opportunity presented by this case to disavow its misguided 1991 ruling that upheld a prohibition on abortion counseling by family planning clinics that receive federal money justice kennedy was unconvincing in trying to explain why the first amendment prohibits muzzling government paid lawyers but somehow allows the muzzling of doctor employees in the family planning program his contention that the lawyers are speaking for their clients whereas the doctors are transmitting the government 's views on contraception and abortion seems a tortured rationalization designed to preserve an earlier decision at odds with the free speech values the court moved to defend this week
