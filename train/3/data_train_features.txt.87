 the tragedy of the israeli palestinian conflict has always been that the moment a glimmer of hope for coexistence appears the forces of rejection and violence come calling yesterday just as a new palestinian leadership seemed to be clearing the way for a new era a powerful bomb went off at a seaside cafe in tel aviv the work of a suicide bomber it claimed the lives of at least two victims it must not be allowed to claim the new chance for peace as well the palestinians passed a milestone yesterday when their legislature approved a new reform minded cabinet under a new reform minded prime minister that should lead to the unveiling of the final settlement promised by president bush and drawn up with europe the united nations and russia for the first time since the collapse of the clinton peace talks and the onset of the 2000 palestinian intifada it was possible to begin imagining a way out of the cycle of death and retribution it was hardly a coincidence that the explosion came just after the new palestinian prime minister delivered an inaugural speech decrying terrorism the extremists behind the tel aviv attack were undoubtedly aiming their violence at their own leadership as well as the israelis they can not be allowed to succeed there will be enormous obstacles to peace all those involved israelis palestinians americans and europeans must be prepared to show determination courage and energy the terrible attack yesterday will be only the first test the speech of the new prime minister mahmoud abbas to the legislative council yesterday was promising he not only denounced terror but he also acknowledged jewish suffering and concerns but as the events that followed so tragically illustrated much more than words will be required of him and of prime minister ariel sharon of israel to surmount the last 31 months of violence both face powerful resistance mr abbas from militant rejectionists mr sharon from his right wing which demands that the peace plan called the road map be rewritten into a set of conditions the palestinians must meet before the israelis make any concession the europeans the russians and the united nations must also pitch in but the united states must play the central role forcefully guiding both sides toward a set of concrete criteria for every stage of the plan and monitoring when they have been met throughout this effort the administration must stand ready to rescue the peace process when it is tested as it was on the day of its beginning
