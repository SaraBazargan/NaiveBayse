 almost 30 years ago james beard was complaining about the asparagus available in the supermarket nowadays he wrote in american cookery little brown 1972 it is cut shockingly long obviously to increase the weight and the waste is tremendous nothing has changed a pound of asparagus yields only about half a pound of edible stalk your chances of getting a better yield not to mention better flavor are directly proportional to how far the asparagus has traveled the best asparagus is always from your own garden or at least from a field within a couple of hours of the market just like corn those beautiful spears begin to lose their sweetness and tenderness the moment they are picked from march to may their fresh bright spring flavor is at its peak this is the time of year for people who do n't want to load up on cream and butter to make things taste good naked asparagus spears rival peanuts for their ca n't eat just one quality but they have even more advantages for good eating they never appear on the hit parade of meganutritious vegetables like broccoli or carrots but they are little storehouses of some important vitamins that are not easy to get enough of particularly some of the b vitamins a 6 1 2 ounce serving contains a little more than the entire daily recommended daily intake of vitamin a team asparagus with a roasted red pepper salsa and you not only increase the vitamin a but you also add significant amounts of vitamin c i 'd give up carrots for asparagus any day asparagus is one of the better sources of folate or folic acid which helps reduce the risk of two birth defects spina bifida and anencephaly a portion of asparagus 6 1 2 ounces provides 256 micrograms of the nutrient more than half of the recommended daily intake of 400 micrograms a day folate and vitamin b6 have also been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks and while the levels of vitamin b6 are not great in asparagus there is some along with two other b vitamins thiamin and riboflavin a serving of asparagus also has four milligrams of vitamin e about half the daily recommendation when you are in the market for asparagus look for fresh green stalks with tightly budded tips stay away from shriveled bunches and choose spears of the same thickness so they will cook evenly steaming is best and fastest in her book red white and greens harpercollins 1996 faith willinger suggests soaking the trimmed tender spears in sugared water for 30 minutes before cooking and it does restore sweetness do n't combine asparagus with a dressing containing vinegar or lemon juice until just before serving it will make the spears turn yellowish gray green and no asparagus does not have to be peeled as long as the tough end of the stalk has been removed by bending it at the point where it snaps off naturally asparagus with roasted red pepper salsa time 15 minutes 4 roasted red bell peppers 1 tiny hot red pepper like a bird pepper or thai pepper 1 medium clove garlic minced 4 tablespoons minced red onion 2 teaspoons lime juice 1 pound asparagus 1 2 cup chopped cilantro 1 slice red peppers into 1 8 inch wide strips trim and seed hot pepper and mince combine roasted peppers hot pepper garlic and onion add lime juice a little at a time until desired tartness is achieved set aside if using immediately or cover and refrigerate until serving time salsa can be made a day ahead remove from refrigerator before cooking asparagus 2 trim tough part from asparagus by breaking stems at the point where the tender part meets the woody stem wash thoroughly steam asparagus 3 to 7 minutes depending on thickness drain and arrange on a serving plate 3 mix cilantro into salsa and spoon over asparagus yield 2 servings
