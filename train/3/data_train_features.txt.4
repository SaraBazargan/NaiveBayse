 directed by kristen coury not rated 87 minutes friends and family an independent feature directed by kristen coury and written by joseph triebwasser tries to crossbreed two popular subgenres of american farce the mafia comedies epitomized by harold ramis 's analyze this 1999 and the long string of gay coming out comedies that probably peaked around the time of mike nichols 's birdcage 1996 but both strains turn out to be too exhausted to reproduce further and friends and family quickly collapses into an overloaded slow moving series of predictable jokes and forced situations greg lauren and christopher gartin are respectively stephen and danny a pair of model handsome gay men who live in a tastefully appointed town house on stuyvesant street in the east village they support their cole porter lifestyle by working improbably as coldblooded enforcers for the mob the film which opens today in new york begins with an unpleasant sequence in which during an intermission at the opera they dash backstage clad in their perfect tuxedos to shake down a tenor who has been late in paying his gambling debts the men come off as little more than well spoken thugs but the moral issues do n't seem to have concerned or even to have occurred to ms coury who finds them endearing a cuddly update of leopold and loeb it 's meant to be hilarious that homosexuals can be as tough as any professional leg breaker and the movie 's central joke is that stephen and danny are much more efficient masters of violence than vito daniel mastrogiorgio and frankie lou carbonneau the two excessively gentle sons of the mafia boss don patrizzi tony lo bianco vito and frankie are n't gay it seems just heavily into cooking and sewing but while stephen and danny are out both to their don and to their parents they have n't told stephen 's midwestern parents beth fowler and frank pellegrino what it is they do for a living this causes complication when stephen 's mom and dad decide to drop in for a surprise visit expecting to find stephen and danny in charge of a successful catering business the surprise visit from the straight world is a staple of this kind of comedy but here instead of pretending to be heterosexuals the two protagonists must assume some ancient mincing gay stereotypes enlisting some of their fellow hit men all traditionally macho beefy brooklyn types to prance around as gay waiters they put on a dinner for their visitors that doubles for reasons best known to the screenwriter as an engagement dinner for the mafia boss 's daughter rebecca creskoff she too has a prospective in law problem her fiance 's parents are a pair of right wing militants tovah feldshuh and brian lane green who see their trip to new york as a chance to initiate a guerrilla war against the federal government with too many characters interacting in too many ways the film feels crowded confused and unproductively frenetic dave kehr
