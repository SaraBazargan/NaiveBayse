 cuddled in santa 's giant arms for a photo gloria perrotta 6 volunteered that she wanted a baby doll for christmas bouncing up and down in line waiting for his turn brady nunez 6 said he was wishing for incredible hulk hands his brother orlando nieves 11 who is deaf quickly signed to his mother michelle texiera that he wanted blue and red sneakers but that gray ones with a red nike swoosh were ok too fortunately none of the dozens of children waiting for this santa seemed prepared to ask for what he could not give to free their mothers from rikers island this holiday season new york city estimates that it has in its foster care program more than 150 children of women being held at rikers island and although most of the women who rotate through the medium  and low security jail will be there months instead of years city officials say they are acutely aware of the grief such separation causes the children particularly at this time of year to try to ease the pain and to make the expected reunification of mothers and children smoother the city invited inmates children to a christmas party at the women 's jail at rikers last week it was the fourth such christmas party to be held despite the soft carols coming from the stereo and enough candy canes for all the elves at the north pole there was no disguising the jailhouse ambience sparse strands of gold tinsel decorated the concrete block walls appetizers of cheese puffs and barbecued potato chips were served on paper plates the mothers were dressed in gray department of correction jumpsuits still many of the women said they were grateful to be having the party sherry heyward has been at rikers for 15 months last year she did not know about the party and she sorely missed her children at christmas this year she sat in a tight circle with cyheme 15 and shanasia 11 her son and daughter who bear a striking resemblance to her it is so much better so much better than nothing at all ms heyward said technically inmates have long had the same rights to see their children once a month and participate in decisions about their care as other mothers whose children are in temporary foster care but until recently the logistics of traveling to rikers which is not served by a subway were complicated enough that many social workers did not routinely make the trip foster care administrators worried that this would strain the ties between parents and children making reunification less likely or less successful four years ago the administration for children 's services joined with the correction department to develop a program to help make visiting rikers easier the city leased vans and hired drivers and the correction department set aside a time just for family visits and space that was child friendly meaning an area that did not have barbed wire or iron bars the children of incarcerated parents program as it was named allowed for monthly visits and four holiday parties each year culminating in a three hour christmas party long before the children arrived the women started gathering in the party room just inside the security gate when there was no sign of the children at 10 minutes past the hour the women chanted we want our kids finally the bus arrived but there was more waiting while officials did a careful inventory to make sure that there was a mother for every set of children and vice versa obviously this is such an emotional thing we have to be careful said maclean guthrie a spokeswoman for the administration for children 's services the children were led slowly through the metal detector and to their mothers the youngest looked dazed one little girl in a brilliant red sweater with velvet trim would not leave her social worker and screamed as her mother approached gloria perrotta 's mother lorez williams who is serving time for assaulting a man with a box cutter sat silently with her most reunions went well ms texiera 's boys could not take their hands off her while brady twisted one side of his mother 's hair into knots orlando used his fingers to comb through the other side and he signed to his mother that she should comb it more often to make it softer the water is hard in here she told him soon after the party began santa arrived hot dogs and baked chicken were served and families relaxed the space was small and each clan settled into a tight little circle and leaned in to be heard above the increasing noise for mothers who see their children only once a month much needs to be done between hot dogs and candy canes after lunch ms texiera pinned orlando down in a chair and signed what was coming next for the family mommy is going to be released in january but that does not mean we can live together she explained with her hands according to the translator i have to go into an 18 month program but if it goes well we can live together soon as part of her sentence ms texiera must live 18 months in a halfway house which does not allow children she said she was afraid that her son would see her out of jail and think that she did not want to be with him she would not say why she was in jail by the time the cake was served some of the children were ricocheting off the walls one 2 year old dashed out of the room and got to the main door where a security guard stopped him other children began to settle down gloria lay quietly in her mother 's arms they were silent holding each other tight around the neck marlene jimenez 33 who had all five of her children visiting found herself yelling at her son kevin osorio 4 to behave and cleaning up after her 5 month old david jimenez who spit up all over her daughter sylvia jimenez 9 it was like this at home she said i never sit down all day until they all go to sleep abruptly the warden said it was time to go mothers stay to clean up she added there were kisses lingering hugs and for some pails of tears ms texiera held orlando so hard it seemed she would break his shoulders he wept with her outside orlando 's foster mother marie taccogna who had accompanied him on the trip asked him in sign language if he was ok yes he flashed back with an enormous winning smile when she cries i want to cry but now i am fine
