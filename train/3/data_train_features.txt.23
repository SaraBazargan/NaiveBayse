 marion berry a democratic representative from arkansas has raised congressional arrogance to a new level gripped by ideological fury in june mr berry added a provision to the agricultural spending bill stripping funds from the office of james lyons an under secretary of agriculture who oversees the forest service and the natural resources conservation service mr lyons 's republican critics later modified the amendment so that it left the funding intact but stripped him of his authority to run the agencies either way it was clear that mr lyons had been singled out for special abuse and that mr berry had started the crusade what had mr lyons done to deserve this according to mr berry himself the under secretary 's main sin was to side with the environmental protection agency when it decided to enforce a long dormant provision of the clean water act to get a better grip on polluted runoff from so called non point sources like farms city streets and golf courses mr lyons helped the epa establish a timetable that would enable farmers to comply with the law on a reasonable schedule but he never challenged the agency 's authority to enforce the law as some agricultural lobbyists had hoped he would nor was he in mr berry 's view sufficiently pro farmer in his negotiations a conservationist mr lyons has angered members of congress before not least for his support of president clinton 's plan to put millions of acres of the national forests off limits to new roads as well as his efforts to enlarge protections for alaska 's tongass national forest but nobody had gone so far as to undermine his job the white house already worn out from its efforts to block anti environmental riders in other bills is unlikely to fight this one in part because it will have no serious effect on the two agencies or even on mr lyons himself the provision expires jan 20 when mr lyons will leave washington to teach at yale but it is still a petty gesture that brings no honor on mr berry or the other congressmen who have willingly gone along with his vendetta
