 the north and south korean governments traded charges today over who was responsible for a clash at sea in which a south korean patrol boat was sunk and four south koreans were killed another 22 south korean marines and sailors were wounded in the battle this morning which broke out in the same yellow sea waters where north and south korean naval forces fought three years ago north korea did not reveal casualties or the extent of damage suffered by its vessels and did not immediately respond to a request by the united nations command for talks in the truce village of panmunjom the incident dashed hopes here that the world cup soccer tournament in its final weekend might encourage efforts at reconciliation with the north the clash came hours before south korea 's team was defeated by turkey in a match for third place played in the south korean city of taegu president kim dae jung in an emergency meeting of his national security council ordered thorough measures by the armed forces to prevent a recurrence of hostilities but stopped short of implying that south korean forces would go on the offensive against north korea rather he asked the armed forces to strengthen security preparedness while instructing his aides to take all necessary measures so that citizens will be able to go about their daily business mr kim who has fostered a sunshine policy of engagement with the north was clearly eager to balance the need for defense against the north with his desire to ensure that the shootout today would be an isolated incident denouncing what he said were armed provocations by the north korean navy 's patrol ships mr kim called the attack a clear violation of the armistice that ended the korean war in july 1953 that increases tensions on the korean peninsula that reality must not be overlooked he observed while calling for calm in south korea north and south korea offered opposing versions of who was responsible for the attack south korea 's defense minister kim dong shin called for an apology from north korea along with punishment of those responsible for this unreasonable provocation it was he said unmistakably clear that the north bore the entire responsibility for this incident north korea in a statement carried by the official korea central news agency several hours later said the south koreans committed such a grave provocation as firing bullets and shells at its boats it was in retaliation against this said the north korean report that the north 's warships were compelled to take a self defensive step in which there was an exchange of fire between the two sides causing losses lt gen lee sang hee chief of operations of the south korean armed forces in a briefing carried by south korea 's four television networks said a north korean patrol boat crossed what is known as the northern limit line extending off the western end of the demilitarized zone at 9 54 am the vessel opened fire at 10 25 am he said after ignoring south korean warnings to return to its side of the line a buffer zone established by the united nation command after the korean war but never recognized by the north a map released by the defense ministry showed the shooting as having occurred several miles west of a small south korean island about 40 miles off the coast the shooting went on for 20 minutes said the defense ministry but the north inflicted the worst damage in the opening salvo killing the skipper of a south korean vessel along with three marines who were manning positions on the deck and wounding another 20 all apparently on the same vessel the number killed seemed likely to rise with one sailor reported missing tonight analysts in the south said the north had deliberately instigated the shootout this morning just as large crowds were gathering on squares and streets throughout the country to cheer the south korean soccer team in its match against turkey this attack is not an accident said a commentary carried by the korea broadcasting system because of world cup the north koreans wanted to get some attention some analysts said that the incident was part of an effort by hard line military leaders in north korea to undermine efforts at reconciliation and embarrass the south at the end of the world cup tournament there are some hawkish people inside north korea who wanted to ruin the world cup said choi jin wook a senior analyst at the korea institute of national unification affiliated with the government 's unification ministry responsible for south korean relations with the north the fact that the north korean leader kim jong il authorized broadcasts of a number of the matches including south korea 's victories over italy and spain may have contributed to the desire to instigate an incident mr choi said they saw everyone in the world was looking at south korea during the world cup he said somebody in north korea was opposed to kim jong il 's decision and hostile to any gesture toward the south or the united states it is very much a calculated plan one reason for believing the incident might not escalate into more fighting said analysts was the precedent set in the much more serious shootout in the yellow sea on june 15 1999 a south korean vessel sunk a north korean torpedo boat and severely damaged another killing at least 20 north korean sailors but the episode was later ascribed to an order given by a local north korean commander not to kim jong il or his top aides
