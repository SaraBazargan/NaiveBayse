 for the longest time i thought that i like many suffered from a fear of flying but recently i realized flying is not the problem packing is packing the only child of moving a fearful god and let 's not go there is a special kind of purgatory what if i get to some exotic out of the way place like los angeles without my tape recorder i travel with three what if some strawberry jam befalls my white shirts better pack 10 what if blue shirts look better pack five what if i get caught in the sun without a hat a gym without sneakers a night at the opera without a cape what if the town i 'm going to does n't have aspirin toothpaste a pen a dictionary personalized stationery underwear cellular phone recharge cord cellular phone laptop cord laptop electric razor cord alarm clock earplugs eyeglasses sunglasses contact lenses contact lens solution books to read if i can not sleep music to listen to if i can not read what if i can not remember what my parents looked like i 've got pictures what if i take in a stray dog or catch a fish better not throw out any newspapers what if what if the sky falls better bring an umbrella so the baggage gets a little heavy so i orbit in a whirl of clutter but i 'm covered when the other shoe drops i 'm ready i 've got a few other pairs plus laptop laptop cords dictionaries books white shirts blue shirts cellular phones and all of last year 's and this year 's new yorkers which i am going to read before monday morning the enthusiastic response to the off broadway play the dazzle has been a real boon to the minimalist movement but a real pain for people like me ever since it opened in the winter the play by richard greenberg reintroduced into a certain cultured vernacular the painful case of homer and langley collyer known as the collyer brothers a couple of sexagenarians discovered dead in 1947 in their uptown brownstone crammed with about120 tons of personal debris 14 grand pianos the chassis of a model t lots of newspapers it took workmen nearly three weeks to find langley 's body crushed under the weight of some of his favorite things i think you should move the fellow who assists me weekly with the upkeep of my one room domestic nest said with a grave expression not long ago i beg your pardon i responded it is very eccentric here eccentric the collyer brothers he said conserving as found i enthused explaining that decay is the latest thing for enlightened architectural preservationists touch nothing leave as is so what if a strong breeze or vibrations from the upstairs neighbor 's next disco night buries me under 4000 books and magazines not including what is piled on the wall to wall bookshelves not to mention the threat from such other myriad collectibles should they take flight as a couple of typewriters two dinosaur laptops several cellophane wrapped bottles of norell perfume in case friends in far hills nj experience a shortage and what appear to be 452 calvin klein t shirts on a hat shelf i 'm happy well i 'm not happy but i am at home john pawson the free world 's mayor of minimalism once told me that every day in any way i must find something i can discard follically challenged i threw away my hairbrush mario buatta the prince of chintz says the clutter is worse at his apartment but he is n't moving either i 've moved enough i see no romance in moving by choice who needs the stress oh i suppose i would n't refuse an aerie with a central park view but it is not in the lotto and the people who thrill to acquire new spaces to decorate and to move residences practically as a form of sport i do n't understand them it is not that possessions possess me but memories do life moves us in enough unexpected directions especially lately one door closes another eventually opens but it can be hell 's bells in the hallway why call the movers more often than you have to this season conserve as found
