 the port authority of new york and new jersey has begun moving on a major project that was delayed for nearly a year as the governors of the two states squabbled over the agency 's spending leasing the world trade center to private interests since the dispute was settled this month the port authority has quietly sent proposals to about 30 large real estate concerns inviting them to bid on taking over the center under a 99 year lease the deal has been made potentially richer because of the delay estimates are now that it could produce 2 billion or more for the agency over time up from the 15 billion projected a year ago agency officials and real estate experts note that when privatization or leasing of the center was first proposed six years ago the new york city real estate market was still recovering from a glut of overbuilding in the 1980 's that made it hard to lease space in the twin towers and other lower manhattan office buildings since then occupancy rates as well as rents at the world trade center have crept steadily upward as vacancy rates in all of lower manhattan for top grade office space has dropped to less than 3 percent for the authority it is exceptionally good timing and good demand said wayne lagary of julian j studley the national 's oldest tenant representative firm and a tenant itself of the world trade center the 18 month standoff between gov george e pataki and gov christine todd whitman had blocked agreement on such major projects as the world trade center lease the leasing of air rights over the port authority bus terminal and ratification of a lease for a major port tenant that impasse ended june 1 when the governors agreed on a package of spending initiatives that provided something for both states the world trade center 's move from public ownership and operation to private operation if completed would mark a journey of light years for the office complex which was derided as folly in 1966 when gov nelson a rockefeller and his brother david the chase manhattan bank president pushed for its construction the plan was criticized then by private developers who feared it would flood the market with excess office space and by environmentalists who warned that it would pollute the hudson river with raw sewage even broadcast companies opposed it for fear that it would interfere with the signals they beamed from the empire state building to angus kress gillespie a professor of american studies at rutgers university and author of the recently released twin towers the life of new york city 's world trade center there is delicious irony in it all the real estate industry that criticized the project is now cherry picking it as one of the port authority 's most valuable assets cherrie nanninga director of real estate for the port authority said the rest of the world was also coming to recognize the architectural value and efficient design of the 16 acre 10 million square foot complex which contains more office space than is found in all of downtown cincinnati in stringing together such figures ms nanninga is practicing for the road trip that she and the agency 's consultants on the deal j p morgan cushman wakefield and millstein realty will be making to the 30 companies that have received the two volume four inch thick offering memorandum that details the lease arrangement 's requirements she expects bids back from those still interested by aug 31 when the agency will draw up a short list of bidders who will receive more detailed and proprietary information so that they can develop a final proposal lewis eisenberg chairman of the port authority said he hoped the center would be leased within a year although the agency would not disclose which 30 companies were deemed qualified to receive the offering memorandum some people familiar with the proposals said privately that the companies include donald trump 's organization tishman speyer gale wentworth mortimer zuckerman 's boston properties and the canadian firm brookfield real estate but a major question shadowing any deal is what position new york city will take on the real estate taxes paid by the complex the port authority now pays the city 275 million in lieu of real estate taxes and deputy mayor anthony p coles said that the taxes on such property would be 100 million a year it is the city 's position as well as the state 's that any successful private bidder pay the full tax mr coles said
