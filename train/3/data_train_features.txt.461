 to the editor fox news moves from the margins to the mainstream by alex s jones week in review dec 1 correctly suggested that i found fox news channel 's reporting on the middle east and terrorism to be fairer than other tv networks' but i do not believe that fox is fairer or better on all international reporting specifically compared with cnn or any other network what concerned me about the coverage of the middle east and terrorism by cnn and most other networks was their allowing many anti united states government and anti israeli claims to be aired virtually unchallenged or unexamined it also seems to me that cnn is making a major and strong journalistic effort to deal with these problems leslie h gelb president council on foreign relations new york dec 10 2002
