 attorney general janet reno has correctly asserted that the tangled case of elian gonzalez the 6 year old cuban boy now living with relatives in miami must be decided under federal immigration law not in the florida courts her declaration will not settle the complicated dispute that pits the clinton administration and the immigration and naturalization service against congressional conservatives and anti castro cubans in miami but it is a start toward legal clarity which represents the best road out of a mess where political agreement will never be possible as ms reno acknowledged in a letter to lawyers for the boy 's miami relatives the ins created great confusion with its initial announcement that it could not grant custody and that such a request would have to be put before the state courts but as a matter of law the ins has authority to make the determination that elian 's father in cuba is the boy 's lawful guardian immigration law experts agree that the florida family court that intervened in the case by awarding temporary custody to a great uncle in miami does not have the authority to overrule the ins ms reno said in her letter that the government was prepared to go to federal court to enforce its primacy in the case and it should do so promptly state federal jurisdictional disputes were common in civil rights cases in the 60 's and experience shows that calm persistence in asserting the primacy of federal law is the best course cooling off periods can be valuable too so the ins decision to extend the jan 14 deadline for returning the boy to his father was prudent that will give time for resolving the legal disputes it is too much to hope of course that political passions will burn themselves out in that time as one anti castro leader in miami said elian has become a symbol of that community 's 41 years of frustration with fidel castro and with its shorter term anger at the clinton administration but it is possible that the hysteria in congress with its plans to bring elian to washington to testify or grant him instant citizenship will recede in hindsight it is clear that the ins should have acted more confidently and promptly but the fact that the ins let relatives in miami care for the boy does not give them a custody claim that overrides federal law elian has remained in the exclusive legal custody of the federal government since his arrival the ins correctly determined that the boy 's father juan miguel gonzalez is his sole lawful guardian and has the right to make the decision to have the child returned to cuba there is no basis in law for overturning mr gonzalez 's claim because he lives in a communist country the clinton administration has the legal authority to enforce the ins decision immediately but the sounder and less disruptive course would be as ms reno suggested in her letter to settle the matter in the proper federal court that should take place before the florida judge rosa i rodriguez convenes her evidentiary hearing on march 6 and further stirs up the local community as well as those in congress and on the presidential campaign trail who want to take advantage of this case
