 though its drive to build a national missile defense is barely under way the bush administration has already managed to shift the focus of the european security debate despite deep seated hopes that the missile defense issue would just go away european officials now seem to accept grudgingly the fact that the new american team is determined to move ahead the new mood was evident at a two day conference here which brought together top security officials and defense experts from europe the united states and asia no ranking europeans officials rushed to grab defense secretary donald h rumsfeld 's offer to help the european allies deploy their own missile defenses but there were no fiery dissents either none of this means that the matter has been put to rest what it does mean is that the debate is entering a new phase in which the issue is more how the united states should go about developing missile defenses than whether it should try the diplomatic and technological questions are more pressing than ever and they could yet affect the debate in both the united states and europe it is still unclear whether the pentagon can overcome the technological hurdles for an effective missile defense and even if it does it could take the better part of a decade to start putting such a system in place but the political costs must be paid up front that is because the united states will need to amend or jettison the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty to embark on a serious testing and development program that means coping with russia 's and china 's anxieties that washington has embarked on a quest for strategic dominance and it means reassuring the europeans that the bush administration is attuned to the concerns of its allies and has not embarked on a go it alone strategy the administration is still in its early days but it clearly has yet to produce a diplomatic strategy to accompany its missile defense plan mr rumsfeld for instance barely mentioned russia in his saturday address to the conference and what he did say consisted of little more than the assertion that with a sizable nuclear arsenal moscow had no reason to be concerned about a limited missile defense the russians provided no openings either seeking to rouse european sentiment against the administration 's plan sergei ivanov the head of president vladimir v putin 's security council warned that it would ignite an arms race in space and undermine the entire edifice of arms control agreements it will result in the annihilation of the whole structure of strategic stability and create the prerequisites for a new arms race mr ivanov said though neither spoke in a confrontational tone the two speeches recalled the superpower jousting of the cold war the battleground was again european public opinion only this time there appears to a general acknowledgment that moscow 's influence has waned it was left to senator joseph i lieberman the former democratic candidate for vice president and a supporter of missile defense to raise the possibility of cooperating with the russians and it was another missile defense supporter senator john mccain the arizona republican and former presidential aspirant who suggested that the united states broaden its strategic agenda by reconsidering ratification of the international treaty banning nuclear tests while reasonable men can differ about the merits of that treaty mr mccain said verification measures should be improved before it was reconsidered by the senate it was an effort to present a security policy that embraced both arms control as well as missile defense during the election campaign george w bush signaled that he would push for deeper perhaps one sided cuts in long range nuclear arms those proposals will take time to develop and the europeans are looking for more than cuts in the american arsenal they want to preserve much of the existing framework of arms control treaties for those who favor cooperation with moscow much will depend on what type of missile defenses the administration designs mr lieberman touted a boost phase system in which interceptors based on ships would be used to shoot down missiles soon after they were launched the system would be far more palatable to the russians than a space based defense in part because it could not down missiles launched from russia 's heartland the russians in fact have proposed a similar approach but the bush administration has talked about developing a system that can also defend against an accidental or unauthorized launching that makes it very unlikely that it will limit itself to a boost phase defense and makes reconciling arms control with a missile shield much more of a challenge administration officials said today that they recognized that they would have to get around to dealing with moscow but they say they wanted to start by consulting with the allies a step mr rumsfeld took when he offered to help the europeans deploy their own missile defenses the primary european concern however seems to be to keep relations with russia on an even keel the europeans seem to see little benefit from missile defense at least in the near term and have little enthusiasm for spending the billions of dollars it would take to build one washington also has a stake in trying to avoid a diplomatic confrontation with moscow without the russians the united states may find it difficult to continue its programs to protect nuclear materials in russia or to press russia to crack down on the export of missile and nuclear technology as for china if the united states can not ease worries there beijing may speed up efforts to modernize its arsenal of 18 land based missiles a development that american intelligence has warned could set off an arms race including india and pakistan though administration officials do not have the answers yet they insist that a comprehensive policy will be produced their diplomatic strategy for now is watch this space we understand that there is a lot of work to do with the allies a lot of work to do with the russians condoleezza rice president bush 's national security adviser told cnn today but we believe that with the proper context and with the chance to do the diplomacy that we can make this work
