 jack 's fifth is the name of the place it has a no nonsense american sound to it turn the name around and you get a fifth of jack 's it feels right if the laws were different every table at jack 's fifth would get a complimentary pack of luckies just for the visuals it 's that kind of restaurant a subterranean lair with a swanky bar lots of circular booths and a retro sense of style that 's part 1940 's nightclub part rat pack hangout herb wilson was most recently the chef at bambou but he started out working with patrick clark and later with larry forgione the influence shows in his vigorous uncomplicated approach to american food taking his cue from the setting he has come up with a menu that 's as reassuring as a firm handshake it 's strong on seasonal ingredients and uncompromising when it comes to delivering clearly defined flavors with a minimum of fuss when he falls short the food can be a little bland when he 's on target however it 's richly satisfying and refreshingly sane the grilled seafood sausage pleasingly plump comes stuffed with chunks of scallop lobster and shrimp a light ginger and lime sauce makes the fresh ocean flavors even more vivid i was unhappy to see the hazelnut crusted foie gras with figs disappear from the menu with the waning of the fig season but mr wilson has replaced it with something i like even better a big slab of seared foie gras resting on an oozing slice of caramelized pineapple you still get the hazelnuts sprinkled around the plate in a viscous syrup of meat juices and liquid fruit it 's cold outside mr wilson understands this in an act of mercy he has come up with a kind of dismantled cassoulet a dark steaming stew of braised oxtail oven dried tomatoes roasted carrots and firm cranberry beans another winter warmer on the appetizer side is his dense butternut squash soup flavored with curry and apple and scattered with toasted pepitas the meat entrees tend to be muscular and hearty so much so that they often overshadow the fish braised short ribs falling off the bone form a blissfully rich partnership with a fruity intense zinfandel sauce and a sweet satin textured parsnip puree mr wilson treats chicken like a heavyweight surrounding it with chanterelles leeks and spinach and giving it a port wine sauce to deal with it 's a mild surprise to see duck breast get relatively gentle handling with a light off sweet cider sauce and a southern accented accompaniment of grits with bits of pancetta and tiny roasted turnips and brussels sprouts roasted loin of lamb with wilted spinach in cardamom jus sounded promising but turned out to be curiously lacking in personality a lot like the rice crusted red snapper fitted out with a thai lite garnish of peanuts cucumber and mint that can only be described as diffident it needed a role model i suggest the parsley roasted halibut a fully empowered even swaggering piece of fish wearing the heady aroma of shiitake mushrooms and saffron like a designer fragrance heather carlucci most recently the pastry chef at pop but before that at judson grill shares some of mr wilson 's instincts her desserts rather than straining for effect rely on clear flavors placed in pleasing combinations her peanut butter ice cream sandwich sounded awful but the thing itself was impressive two paper thin oatmeal cinnamon coins provided the crunch and contrast to roasted peanut ice cream and banana slices caramelized in grappa pumpkin panna cotta with chestnuts and rum sabayon was a skillful very american rebuttal to creme brulee jack 's fifth is situated in an unforgiving space formerly occupied by pondicherry the ceilings are low there are no windows because the restaurant is one floor below street level in a mighty effort the restaurant 's designers have solved about three quarters of the problems banquettes and circular booths tend to focus the attention of diners on each other rather than the space around them and the s shaped bar off the entrance strikingly backlighted and hung with slinky fabrics goes a long way toward relieving the hovering sense of claustrophobia good spacing between tables also helps imagination failed however when it came to the old stock photographs that line the walls each one depicts an american worker dressed in the uniform of his or her trade like an emblem of honest labor the nurse rubs shoulders with the secretary who stands next to the welder and the deliveryman none of them would ever have eaten at a restaurant like jack 's fifth although they might have lived down the block from a bar called jack 's but i 'm willing to bet that every one of them would have understood the shell steak with onions and wine sauce and lemon meringue parfait jack 's fifth rating two stars 8 west 58th
