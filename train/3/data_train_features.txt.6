 the united states central command combat surveillance video showed an iraqi military vehicle hiding beneath a bridge a smart bomb glided in from the right destroying the vehicle but leaving the bridge intact then came a surveillance picture of iraqi military communications equipment atop a building within some 2000 year old ruins on the bank of the tigris river a historic site recognized by the united nations in that case american commanders decided not to strike these two targets and the opposite decisions made as to whether to attack illustrate the complicated task given to american war planners who are charged with destroying a government but not a country the military mission calls for coalition forces to topple saddam hussein and rid his nation of any weapons of mass destruction that may be hidden there at the same time the war plan calls for leaving as much iraqi infrastructure as possible standing to ease postwar reconstruction and to minimize civilian deaths in order to quiet angry public opinion as the war enters its second week however military affairs experts ponder whether more indiscriminate bombing might in the end hasten victory and save the lives of american troops and even spare more iraqis the pain of a grinding ground war we decided we would restrain the use of air power for reasons of humanity and world image said loren thompson an air power expert at the lexington institute a policy research center here we have imposed a burden on our campaign plan that may slow down victory and diminish the quality of the victory we achieve american generals can ratchet up the violence delivered by air with just a command mr thompson noted and they are expected to do so as american ground forces move to face republican guard troops encircling baghdad the question is what measure of risk of civilian casualties and damage to buildings like hospitals and schools will be considered acceptable in order to secure a speedier victory this quandary has been placed upon american commanders by mr hussein who has ordered his forces arrayed in neighborhoods even using hospitals as garrisons according to pentagon officials the mantra heard at almost every wartime news conference held by defense secretary donald h rumsfeld or gen tommy r franks the senior commander for the war and his subordinates is that the american military will continue its efforts to exercise extreme prudence in choosing and attacking targets in order to minimize civilian deaths and damage to public works we have a very very deliberate process for targeting brig gen vincent brooks deputy director of operations for the united states central command said during a briefing in qatar today it 's unlike any other targeting process in the world it takes into account all science it takes into account all capability and we do everything physically and scientifically possible to be precise in our targeting and also to minimize secondary effects whether it 's on people or on structures but the second guessing is well under way selective bombing is wrongheaded perpetuating the regime causes more casualties certainly among iraqi troops than 'collateral damage would edward n luttwak a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies wrote in a commentary published by the los angeles times today even as some military experts in the academic world suggest that more intense bombing be considered today kofi annan the united nations secretary general became the latest international leader to serve notice that the united states will suffer far reaching consequences if it starts hitting targets that kill civilians and destroy infrastructure mr annan 's comments came as american officials reacted cautiously to reports that a marketplace in baghdad had been damaged by an explosion that left 14 people dead at the pentagon maj gen stanley mcchrystal said american forces had not aimed any ordnance at that neighborhood in the iraqi capital while officials could not absolutely rule out a hit by an errant american bomb or missile they also said the explosion might have been caused by iraqi antiaircraft fire falling back to earth or a faulty iraqi missile we do know for a fact that something landed in the shaab district general mcchrystal said but we do not know if it was us or iraqi we do know that we did not target anything in the vicinity proponents of air power have argued almost since the invention of the modern warplane that victory can be achieved through the air by attacking enemy leaders communications and the centers of gravity that prop up their governments for this war with iraq the air campaign had been planned to open the offensive and set the stage for the ground attack but that sequence had to be reversed after president bush ordered the surprise missile strike last wednesday in an effort to kill mr hussein and top iraqi leaders general mcchrystal said that since the war began more than 600 cruise missiles and 4300 other precision guided munitions have been launched at iraq but a week into the war air power experts acknowledge that the pentagon 's current bomb and missile campaign failed to deliver a quick knockout blow though that could still happen in recent days the air campaign shifted from mostly planned strikes against leadership targets and command or communications centers to attacks on iraq 's forces in the field specifically the republican guard divisions any analysis of the air campaign by anyone outside the most senior military commands and civilian leadership is naturally based on a hodgepodge of television images scattered witness reports from the front and a sense of history many of the effects of air operations are cumulative said eliot a cohen a professor at johns hopkins university who directed the air force 's definitive study of the first war against iraq at any given time you may think you 're not doing very much but suddenly when the right pressures come together the other guy collapses but he cautioned that the public 's view of the air war is opaque at best
