 the second baseman was habitually recalling some of his positive baseball experiences laying them out as immaculately as the uniforms in a marine 's closet how his uncle eddie implored him to stifle teams with defense how he went to spring training 10 years ago as a class aa player and vowed that the minnesota twins would keep him how he thinks that he will be remembered most for helping the yankees win three world series titles not for throwing baseballs so haphazardly that he was benched and pondered retirement the words tumble out of chuck knoblauch 's mouth in an avalanche of theories if you ask the questions knoblauch has the answers long rambling answers almost everything knoblauch utters is about positive reinforcement seemingly a sign that the therapy he has intimated receiving has centered around remembering the good forgetting the bad eliminating distractions and treating every day like the new 24 hours that it is as knoblauch plowed through a meal of chicken and vegetables and three bottles of water in the yankees clubhouse recently he chatted for an hour about why he will conquer the throwing problems that have dogged him since the 1998 season knoblauch has pride but he is also a realist that is why he came here one month earlier than necessary that is why he apparently had off the field counseling he needed the help this year it 's just different knoblauch said i 'm more comfortable and more relaxed i know what 's going on i know the plan i know what i have to do i 'm not concerned with anyone else in a good way not a selfish way i 'm doing what i have to do to get myself ready to play with that comes more focus and blinders i can focus on drills instead of the other stuff flying around if he were a witness testifying on his own behalf a jury would believe him it would believe that the 32 year old knoblauch will not worry about having a microscope focused on him every time he cocks his right arm to throw knoblauch talked about amazing myself with how i 've held my head up through some of this and added i know i can do it and i will do it still no matter how convincing knoblauch sounds the ritual starts again on thursday and his actions will speak for him knoblauch must throw the ball straight you can write it you can say it people can ask me whatever they want i do n't care he said if i go out there and play that stuff will die as far as how fast it will die that will be up to whoever 's in control of that obviously knoblauch controls that he should realize that if knoblauch throws bullets to first base the kind of throws he has been making for the last six days here the questions will fade no throwing errors will translate into no stories about throwing errors as optimistic as knoblauch has been history should make the yankees wary after going the first 32 first games of the 2000 season without a throwing error knoblauch made one on may 12 and that began a troublesome stretch in which he made 13 errors 11 on throws in the next 36 games knoblauch who fidgets with his batting gloves before every pitch and who tinkers with his approach at the plate often must not stray from his new philosophy of accentuating the positive and forgetting the past in the past knoblauch 's last error has sometimes led to a batch of errors i 'm looking to tomorrow knoblauch said and that 's it manager joe torre described knoblauch as an unhappy young man who played in a fishbowl last season and he sounded relieved that knoblauch seems confident torre repeated that knoblauch will be his leadoff man no matter what the result is out there and said that he will not search for alternatives if knoblauch is struggling as late as june if something is n't right i 'd just as soon be surprised by it than expect it torre said i just sense he 's a different guy right now the yankees are scrutinizing knoblauch more than any other player because they have an oral agreement for a two year 18 million contract extension and they will undoubtedly try to settle for a lesser amount if knoblauch 's woes persist knoblauch pleaded ignorance about the existence of an agreement but he compared his attitude now to the one he had as a rookie with the twins in 1991 when his goal was to put pressure on them by playing well he surprisingly made the team that season won the rookie of the year award and helped the twins win a title i want to play here knoblauch said sounding as if he were auditioning again i want to be a yankee knoblauch never worried about defense until three years ago as his uncle eddie used to say beat them with your glove knoblauch said it is vital for him to get back to that high level of defensive play he displayed when he won a gold glove in 1997 and he said it with more confidence than ever before but knoblauch 's words will seem hollow until he does it the confidence is nice the actions matter the ritual starts again on thursday knoblauch must throw the ball straight
