 a combination of factors makes north korea uniquely dangerous it has an unpredictable and untrustworthy dictator an economy in free fall and a two track nuclear weapons effort that appears more advanced than iraq 's one of those tracks a secret uranium enrichment program was uncovered in october the other built around plutonium reprocessed from spent reactor fuel has been closed since 1994 by agreement with the united states now it seems about to be reopened on thursday pyongyang announced that it was immediately reactivating a sealed power reactor that could produce one to two bombs worth of weapons grade plutonium per year this development requires an energetic diplomatic response from the bush administration the joint declaration on friday by mr bush and south korea 's president that the north 's actions are unacceptable is accurate but not enough washington seems to think that it can afford the luxury of deferring the north korean problem until it has finished disarming iraq it can not the starting point must be diplomacy military action would risk a violent north korean response that could be ruinous to south korea it could also endanger japan and the 100000 american troops currently based in northeast asia diplomacy coercive enough to work is hampered by the stubborn unwillingness of most of north korea 's neighbors to consider tough sanctions these obstacles must somehow be overcome and there is little time to lose restarting the reactor is bad enough what would be even more alarming would be ending the current international monitoring of north korea 's spent fuel and of a nearby plutonium reprocessing plant the international atomic energy agency is working hard to keep those monitors in place to succeed it must have the united states wholehearted support north korea claims that it needs the power reactor to replace electricity lost when the united states and other countries recently suspended fuel oil shipments because of the enriched uranium deception sending the international monitors home and allowing plutonium reprocessing to resume would leave no doubt that nuclear weapons production was north korea 's real and only agenda the white house must now mobilize an all out diplomatic effort to prevent that next step from being taken enlisting as much help as it can get from russia and china the two countries with the greatest influence in pyongyang if north korea is not compelled to change course and abandon both of its nuclear weapons tracks it could soon be producing several nuclear bombs a year it currently has long range missiles that threaten japan and might one day be upgraded to reach parts of the united states the world is a complicated place with multiple dangers and the united states can not always choose to deal with them in sequential order at best the iraq crisis will not be resolved for many more months dealing with the north korean weapons threat can not wait that long the danger is too grave and immediate
