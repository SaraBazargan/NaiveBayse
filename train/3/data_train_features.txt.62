 a wine cork is much more functional than it may seem in restaurant kitchens cooks often use corks to stack plates with space in between they cut the corks in half diagonally so that there is a long flat side they lay three or four corks flat side down around the rim of a plate then stack another plate on top that way they can place garnishes on the plates in advance then finish the dishes as orders come in at home this could be handy for dinner parties prepared in small kitchens you could for example place a thin galette on each plate in advance stack the plates and then add a scoop of ice cream just before serving corks can also protect the tips of knives that you do n't use very often cut the corks in half across the middle then push them onto the tip of a knife but perhaps the best second use for corks is for pot lids whose steel handles get too hot to touch wedge a cork or two underneath the handle perpendicular to it and you will never need to struggle with a pot holder you can simply lift the lid by the corks which never absorb heat so drink up amanda hesser
