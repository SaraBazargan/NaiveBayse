 people attend flower shows for all sorts of reasons at this time of year some enjoy the heady fragrance of flowers and greens amid winter 's doldrums others crave the refreshing colors of daffodils and delphiniums and still others go to learn about new plants and how they can fit into borders and landscapes many of the exhibitors at the philadelphia flower show which opens next sunday are in the last category jack blandy for example has more than 300 david austin roses just about ready to bloom i 've never seen the flowers on the pilgrim dark lady and molineux roses he said in a recent interview and i 'm really looking forward to that mr blandy said he chose the austin roses for his exhibit because their fragrance and old fashioned soft beauty matched the show 's theme the pleasures of the garden he also likes these roses for their ease of care he 'll place 250 roses in the exhibit both as hedges and intermingled with other plants with the remaining 50 or so to serve as backups he ordered the roses last winter and by april had them all planted in the fields at his stoney bank nursery in glen mills pa there they were pruned fed and trimmed so that by the time they were placed in greenhouses last fall they were twice the size of plants one normally buys and sees at garden centers once inside the greenhouse under a carefully controlled temperature and feeding regime the plants which had not been allowed to flower the previous summer could barely control their innate desire to burst forth with buds mr blandy is not sure how many of the 40 varieties he has will make it to the show some like his favorites gertrude jekyll with rich pink flowers and graham thomas with butter yellow blossoms will definitely be featured others which he has never grown before will have to perform well before he sets up the exhibit in order to ensure a place michael petrie of styer nurseries in concordville pa loves to experiment and has no qualms about trying untested plants in his eye catching exhibits we all like to try plants we personally think are interesting he said of the exhibitors mr petrie particularly likes to promote plants that are just entering the nursery trade and uses his flower show display to demonstrate their potential unusual and underused annuals will be among the features in his display this year he 's hoping that a white cultivar of leonetis leonurus will do better than the species plant he grew last year the species of this fragrant plant grows seven feet tall in its native south africa in mr petrie 's greenhouse however it soared to 8 1 2 feet and at that height did not like being moved on a cold winter day to the flower show one hour after it arrived the leaves started to drop and mr petrie had to quickly find a replacement plant alba the very rare white cultivar only grows four feet tall and mr petrie is hoping its shorter stature will make it more amenable to a move from his greenhouse to the pennsylvania convention center where the show runs through march 10 information on the show is available at wwwtheflowershowcom or through its sponsor the pennsylvania horticultural society at 215 988 8800 mr petrie likes this annual not only for its lovely scent but also for its dramatic appearance its flowers look like hair on a lion 's mane and climb up the tall stem in whirls rounded seed clusters shortly follow and hold for a long time he also has several salvias in his display calling them one of the most neglected underused group of annuals with great late season impact among these is black and blue an s guaranitica cultivar with a black hood over a gentian blue flower about four feet tall this salvia tolerates shade mr petrie is excited about an agave family member with the impossible to remember botanical name of beschorneria yuccoides three feet in height and diameter this plant features wide bluish green strap leaves that curve out to form a striking centerpiece in a container cugliotta landscape in southampton nj has designed the main display of this year 's show a victorian themed garden and it is packed with thousands of flowers shrubs and trees that demonstrate at least one of the five senses the designers laurel allen doug burgess and joe cugliotta looked near and far to select plants for their display one nearby site was mr cugliotta 's home he allowed his huge weeping beech fagus sylvatica pendula to be dug and placed as a striking sculptural accent in the display the three also searched literature to find and grow the most praiseworthy plants there is a great emphasis on fragrance in their design and one of the stars in this area is hosta guacamole which has been described by tony avent a well known nurseryman as one of the most exciting to hit the market in years it features chartreuse gold foliage edged in dark green and large near white beguilingly scented flowers in the taste section of their sensory garden they are featuring the white flowers of heritage raspberry rubus species left in natural settings this would produce fruit of high quality during the show however spectators will have to be content with the sight of its attractive blossoms while dreaming of the luscious tastes that would follow cuttings correction march 3 2002 sunday a picture credit with the cuttings column last sunday about the philadelphia flower show misstated the name of
