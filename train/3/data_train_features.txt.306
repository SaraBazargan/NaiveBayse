 there is both a place and a need for children 's works in the classical music repertory but few composers have turned their hand to the task and of those that have few have done it successfully success of course is in the ear of the beholder but one criterion is that the work can sit comfortably beside the concert works in the composer 's catalog as prokofiev 's peter and the wolf saint saens 's carnival of the animals britten 's young people 's guide to the orchestra and poulenc 's histoire de babar do it must also accomplish several seemingly irreconcilable tasks it must be sufficiently entertaining to engage young minds that are likely to wander if the piece evolves too slowly it must offer a lesson of some sort even if it 's only a sense of what orchestral instruments sound like and what kinds of imagery they can evoke but at the same time it must avoid seeming didactic probably the biggest challenge though is in writing a work that adults can listen to without squirming raphael mostel 's travels of babar based on the second jean de brunhoff 's babar book meets these disparate demands nicely judging from children 's reactions on sunday afternoon at florence gould hall where the work had its new york premiere run babar remains a children 's favorite and mr mostel capitalized on that by making sure that the story was seen as well as heard pictures from the book were projected on a screen behind the musicians mr mostel 's music is direct picturesque and rather sweet when babar and his bride celeste fly off on their honeymoon in a balloon a gently rising figure for viola cello piano and lightly rippling percussion lifts them on their way in the hour that follows their adventures narrated here by eli wallach and anne jackson in an english translation by phyllis rose are accompanied by elephant trumpeting car horns in the travel music quickly passing dissonances in the battle with the rhinoceroses and bird calls in the evocation of the elephant kingdom the characters are not given instrumental equivalents but each of the instruments in the octet that accompanies the reading has opportunities to show off and to push the edges of their techniques there are also references in the score for adults including a fragment of a bach cello prelude some stravinskian cornet music in a circus scene and a touch of slightly controlled chaos in the spirit of john cage perhaps most crucially the music has a narrative and lyrical flow that makes its charms hard to resist the travels of babar does sit oddly beside the works for which mr mostel is known principally he has been an explorer in timbre texture and acoustics and has created a repertory of entrancing works using ancient instruments principally shofars and tibetan singing bowls still this work which has occupied mr mostel for the last nine years seems an expansion into another musical realm rather than an abberation the fine musicians in the octet were david hattner clarinetist martin kuuskman bassoonist tom hoyt cornetist michael hosford trombonist joseph kubera pianist eduardo leandro percussionist aurora manuel violist and dorothy lawson cellist paul hostetter conducted
