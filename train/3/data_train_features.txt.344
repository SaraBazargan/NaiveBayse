 to the editor thanks for your fascinating article the house on west 11th street by mel gussow march 5 on the weathermen explosion but what bothered me about this otherwise engrossing account is the statement that next to the wilkersons the boudins and the weathermen themselves the people most affected by the explosion were the owners and residents of the adjoining buildings this is hardly the case surely the parents and friends of the three who died have had far more emotional shrapnel to contend with in their lives than the neighbors who admittedly suffered a calamitous violation of their sense of safety not to mention property damage in fact the three who were killed linger like hidden corpses in the sub basement of the story what led them to their extreme beliefs how did their families cope these are questions not to be dismissed entirely thanks for your attention and for publishing this kind of personal new york history catherine aman gramercy
