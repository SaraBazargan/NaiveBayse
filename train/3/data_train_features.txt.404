 sultan muhammad faizi was relaxing over a meal of bread and spinach in the control tower of kabul international airport when his radio crackled to life a united states government plane was arriving from tajikistan and needed directions on how to land it is no easy proposition to land a plane at this ruined airfield the main gateway to afghanistan is a gantlet ringed by mines pocked by bomb craters and littered with the charred hulks of destroyed aircraft you 'll have to land on the taxiway mr faizi instructed the pilots on monday after padding barefoot over to the radio the runway is not usable turning to a visitor he said there was no place in the world where they let planes land on a taxiway which in kabul is much narrower than the runway not to mention curved but what can we do six american bombs rained on kabul airport 's runway during the united states led bombing campaign in october leaving yawning craters in the tarmac several others landed on the taxiway and apron one bomb still unexploded is buried under a fleet of jets owned by the state carrier ariana airlines for all that kabul is determined to have its airport back in business since last month bomb clearing teams have been combing the runway and adjacent fields digging up nearly 2000 unexploded bombs this dangerous work has enabled the airport to start a twice weekly commercial flight between here and the western afghanistan city of herat it also takes off and lands on the taxiway in three or four days the airport authorities said kabul will be able to reopen its runway to larger jets everybody is determined to help afghanistan reclaim its national airport lakhdar brahimi the united nations special envoy to afghanistan said after a tour of the mine clearing operations on monday mr brahimi said that fully reopening the airport which had been closed since fall would help relief efforts the united nations has had to use a military air base at bagram about 30 miles north of kabul which makes bringing in food and other supplies cumbersome reopening kabul airport would also restore a semblance of normality to afghanistan 's capital nearly two months after northern alliance troops drove the taliban out of the capital it remains largely cut off from the world land routes are hazardous because of bandits while bagram is accessible only to military planes and flights organized by the united nations many people after five years want to come back to kabul said ghulam ali timar the airport general manager who took over after the taliban fled the reopening of the airport means that kabul is safe kabul of course is far from safe and judging by the extent of the devastation at the airport regular operations are likely to be weeks if not months away beyond the damage from the recent bombs kabul airport has been a battleground ever since the soviet occupation of afghanistan like everything here it is also impoverished mr ghulam said he had no fire trucks no weather monitoring equipment and no snowplows crucial for an airport in a place where winters can be severe he also has no radio transmitter to communicate with commercial flights from outside the country it was ripped out of the air traffic control center in the chaos of the bombing raids somebody took it i do n't know who it was mr ghulam said with a shrug but we are starting from zero the united nations had offered to help the airport obtain new radio equipment but before any international commercial flights can arrive the afghan interim government must negotiate with the united states to reopen large parts of afghanistan 's airspace with american warplanes still bombing suspected al qaeda redoubts in eastern afghanistan that seems unlikely to happen soon meantime the airport is being held together with wire and glue the united states replaced windows in the control tower that were blown out when two american bombs landed near the terminal a rocket crashed into the offices of ariana airlines two floors below narrowly missing the tower on the runway more than 100 mine clearing experts are using bomb detectors bomb sniffing dogs and their eyes to scour the airfield when they see a suspicious object they mark it with red paint the british military has supplied a heavily armored vehicle known as a flail which trundles up and down the runway pounding the asphalt with powerful hammers to set off mines and other explosives crews are filling the craters left by the bombs but the american plane that landed on monday had to swerve after touching down to avoid a particularly nasty pothole a team of mine clearers scurried across the taxiway just before it landed like pedestrians trying to beat a traffic light running a seat of the pants operation frustrates mr faizi who has worked for 39 years as an air traffic controller we used to be able to warn people on the ground about planes coming in he said noting that the ground communications system was also broken now i just stand here and watch them
