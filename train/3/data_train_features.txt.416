 sarah collins rudolph even with one eye of glass can still see the morning of sept 15 1963 can see it sharp and clear she can still see four pretty girls including her sister addie mae collins primping in the church basement just minutes before they were to ascend the stairs and sing with the grown ups in the choir at 16th street baptist church she can see the water running over her 12 year old hands as she washed them in the ladies lounge see a 14 year old addie mae fussing with the sash of denise mcnair who was just 11 and still played with dolls she can see them all there framed by the basement window addie mae denise cynthia wesley and carole robertson just before the earth shook and the glass flew at her face and eyes like buckshot then she could not see at all her eyes pierced by the shrapnel and she lay in the darkness and called addie addie addie with mrs rudolph 's account here today of the bombing of the 16th street baptist church prosecutors rested their case in the state murder trial of bobby frank cherry the 71 year old white supremacist who is believed to be the last living suspect in a historic act of evil when she could finally see again after the operations and the bandages and the loss of her right eye mrs rudolph could see that it was the simple act of washing her hands that spared her and that a few seconds later she would have been with her friends in front of that window just feet from the bomb glass went in my eyes mrs rudolph said as prosecutors showed the jury a picture of her in the hospital then her eyes covered with white bandages but the few feet between where she stood and her friends was the bridge between life and death as she spoke a gray haired woman in the jury box tried not to cry her bottom lip trembled mrs rudolph did not cry she walked back to her chair sat down and folded her arms and began to wait as she has waited for 38 years for a little more justice in a case that began back when a young wavy haired man named bobby frank cherry first became one of the fbi 's prime suspects in an investigation that sputtered and stumbled across four decades just a few hours before another prosecution witness had described a slightly older mr cherry a man who had left the klan behind in alabama in the 1970 's and moved to texas to open a carpet cleaning business and brag to relatives about the day in alabama that he struck a historic blow for white supremacy teresa francesca stacy mr cherry 's granddaughter told the jury that she heard her grandfather boast of the bombing on the front porch of his trailer in east texas he said he helped blow up a bunch of niggers back in birmingham said ms stacy who was about 10 at the time he seemed rather jovial as he said it she said she said she only heard mr cherry say that once but had heard other relatives say that he had told them that same thing several times i 've heard it for years she said in 1997 she saw her grandfather in a television press conference he denied any role in the bombing i knew he was lying ms stacy said i called the news people they put me on hold for a long time i hung up the phone and called the fbi mickey johnson mr cherry 's defense lawyer then began chipping away at ms stacy 's credibility by asking her questions about her motive for her testimony and her past he asked ms stacy if the attention from the case including articles in glamour magazine and texas monthly and an appearance on good morning america had changed your life he suggested that she had offered her testimony in return for a deal from prosecutors to reduce the sentence of her brother who is serving a prison term in texas for robbery and burglary well i figured i should n't be dragged through the mud for nothing she said mr johnson over the objections of prosecutors but with the blessing of judge james garrett then asked ms stacy about her addictions to drugs and alcohol she told him that she had been addicted to drugs when she was 12 and was in a rehabilitation at age 13 my drug of choice was cocaine she said she said she is also a recovering alcoholic who drinks socially ms stacy was not the first relative to say in this trial that mr cherry boasted about the killings willadean brogdon a still angry former wife who was married to mr cherry from 1970 until their divorce in 1973 testified on thursday that she had heard him brag about the bombing and that he told her he was the man who actually planted the bomb underneath a church stairwell the night before the explosion officially mr cherry has repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with that bombing and told investigators in 1997 that he could not have been involved in making or planting the bomb on the night of saturday sept 14 1963 the night investigators have long believed the bomb was placed because he was at home with his wife who was ill with cancer mr cherry told investigators he went home to be with her and to watch wrestling later in an interview with jerry mitchell of the clarion ledger in jackson miss he said he always watched wrestling on saturday nights mr mitchell in a search of television logs found that there was no wrestling on television that night because there has been no forensic evidence linking him to the blast prosecutors have tried to build a case of circumstantial evidence heavy with testimony about mr cherry 's hatred of blacks and his desire to keep them from mixing with whites in the birmingham of the 1960 's bob herren an fbi agent who interviewed mr cherry in texas in 1997 said mr cherry told him that in 1957 he used a pair of brass knuckles to punch the rev fred shuttlesworth bopped shuttlesworth between the eyes mr cherry told him mr herren testified fred shuttlesworth would go on to become a civil rights hero in birmingham mr herren said mr cherry told him the ku klux klan never would have blown up a church because the klan was a religious organization itself he told me he sang in the klan choir at churches and funerals mr herren said mr herren said mr cherry also told him he had joined the klan because he wanted to work on political campaigns and wanted to chase women when he went to klan rallies day after day prosecution witnesses have described a much different birmingham from the one that exists today a city where blacks and whites mix and mingle in restaurants and office buildings the whites only signs are long gone but it was a different place the day that chris mcnair denise 's father remembered from the witness stand here today too vividly he said he had gone to a different church that day on birmingham 's southside he remembers hearing a faraway boom he turned to his brother and asked is that thunder as he spoke about the death of his daughter in what some people saw as a war by some whites against blacks prosecutors showed the jury a picture of denise holding her favorite doll it has pink skin and blonde hair it is white
