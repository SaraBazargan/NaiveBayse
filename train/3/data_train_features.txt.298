 so will the president focus more on wall street 's lipstick index or teddy roosevelt 's big stick index the lipstick index is a way to judge a recession when the economy goes down lipstick sales go up women indulge in smaller luxuries and skip bigger ones the big stick index is a way conservatives judge the president will w whack saddam with the stick or will he fold the way his dad did mr bush spent his first year using his father 's failures as a reverse playbook trying to dodge 41 's mistakes 43 catered to congressional right wingers and muscled through a mammoth tax cut when the economy slumped he took great pains to tell americans he understood their pain so he would not seem oblivious and wrapped up in foreign affairs like his father then sept 11 hit and he had to get wrapped up in foreign affairs if the president uses the reverse playbook now and continues to coddle the conservatives his father neglected he has to go topple the wacky iraqi completing poppy 's unfinished business but if he does that he turns his attention away from the recession repeating poppy 's mistake after his war when he never used his celestial approval ratings to fix the economy it 's a surreal oedipal loop de loop made all the loopier by the spectacle of history repeating itself and putting the son at the same juncture where his father made two of the most critical and criticized decisions of his presidency because 41 detached from baghdad and detached from economic angst at home 43 is under extra pressure to attack iraq while attacking the recession the man who started out as the most disengaged president in modern history is now being pestered by his aides and his conservative base to engage engage engage his political and military advisers are competing for his attention as he decides how hotly to pursue the war at a time when the economy is foundering and deficits are back it is a measure of how nervous the white house is given republican losses in the recent gubernatorial elections that it dumped gov james gilmore of virginia as party chief last week should the president rout osama and the taliban and then focus like a laser beam on this economy as bill clinton said when he beat bush senior or should he go on to phase two as the get saddam crowd calls it now that the us is on a roll as state department official richard armitage puts it at the moment mr bush is juggling furiously in his saturday radio address the president concentrated on the recession and expressed concern about soaring unemployment it 's a time to reach out to americans who are hurting he said to help them put food on the table and to keep a roof over their heads and if mr bush has not yet decided whether to crack saddam with the big stick he has been talking more loudly anyway he said if iraq did not allow un inspectors into the country to check for weapons of mass destruction it would find out the consequences it 's hard to say if the swagger was meant to co opt the string of perles richard perle and others who are in full cry to crush saddam or to lay a real groundwork for at least bombing iraq it is curious that the president tolerates such open provocation from people in his administration and connected to it given that the clamor sets him up to look soft on saddam if he does n't go after iraq paul wolfowitz the no 2 pentagon official has been the spark plug of the get saddam club other drum beaters are mr perle on a pentagon advisory board and fellow board member james woolsey who went on a government plane with a team from justice and defense to investigate whether iraq was involved in the 9 11 attacks if we can not drive this tyrant from office mr perle said on cnn then we ca n't do anything in an interview with bob novak and al hunt on cnn saturday donald rumsfeld was asked about mr perle 's agitations look richard perle is richard perle he replied praising mr perle but adding he does not speak for the president he does not speak for me so many voices so little time it 's enough to send a president burrowing back into his feather pillow
