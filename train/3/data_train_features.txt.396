 lebanon 's border with israel was quiet today as the lebanese army and local palestinian officials confined angry palestinian protests to their refugee camps although renewed clashes along the border were widely expected after the outburst of violence on thursday between israelis and palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip beefed up army checkpoints along the coast road and camp leaders orders kept away protesters this is important and significant said a high ranking official with the united nations peacekeeping force in southern lebanon this is the first time they have actually prevented demonstrations on the border once people reach the border it can get out of control at the crossing here where on saturday 2 palestinian protesters were killed and 24 wounded as they threw stones and a gasoline bomb over the fence at israeli troops the only people in sight were a handful of television camera operators and journalists on a bluff near the gate waiting for something to happen also in the area were lebanese army intelligence officers in a black mercedes benz bristling with radio antennas and a casually dressed squad of young men who said they were security for hezbollah the islamic military group that seized three israeli soldiers last week no israeli patrols were moving on their perimeter road below an israeli blimp dangling a television camera floated overhead to survey the scene lebanon has been under intense international pressure to deploy its army along the border a demand made most recently by united nations secretary general kofi annan on a visit on thursday to president emile lahoud the government here has repeatedly insisted that it will not be a border guard for israel mr lahoud was reported to have told mr annan this is a final and irrevocable position a series of behind the scenes contacts has been aimed at keeping the border calm avoiding israeli reprisals although no lebanese soldiers were seen along the border today there was a highly visible buildup on the coast road between sidon and tyre that was clearly intended to prevent groups from traveling to the border for demonstrations armored personnel carriers clustered around traffic circles and the checkpoints were stopping only southbound vehicles creating a backup groups of palestinian protesters from camps near tripoli in northern lebanon were reported to have been turned back at army roadblocks the ain el hilwe camp in sidon as with most camps saw emotional demonstrations but a human chain of palestinian officials kept the demonstrators from trying to go past the camp gates most of the palestinian camps here are encircled by the lebanese army which syria ultimately in large part directs although the camps have arms caches palestinians are kept under tight surveillance in reaction to the days of the civil war here when they formed a state within a state at the rashidiye camp near tyre lebanese soldiers meticulously searched every departing vehicle in rashidiye the fatah commander for lebanon sultan abu alaynen who despite being under an apparently somewhat technical lebanese death sentence works from an office suite surrounded by heavily armed guards he said there were no plans at this point to mount border demonstrations or operations into israel these days we are doing our best not to let things get out of control in southern lebanon he said but he added palestinians trying to strike out on their own had been caught by lebanese officials as they tried to approach the border the leading newspaper an nahar reported this morning that lebanese security had intercepted an armed squad of palestinians overnight that had been headed for the border from a refugee camp near tyre but gave no further details we are playing in a very dangerous game here a spokesman for the united nations force timor goksel said all we need is one man with a kalishnikov or an rpg a rocket propelled grenade and we have a disaster on our hands
