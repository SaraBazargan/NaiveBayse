 to the editor as a sept 26 editorial notes democrats are rushing to pass a war resolution that many privately disagree with hoping to avoid having to talk about this issue in the election campaign but the real problem democrats have with voters is that on too many issues they do not act on what everyone knows are their real beliefs it is obvious that many senate democrats think that carrying out the bush tax cuts will produce decades of deficits but none of them will propose eliminating those cuts the effect of condescending to the public on the important questions of the day is that democrats are seen as standing for nothing and give no one a reason to vote for them as long as democrats continue to be paralyzed by political calculation they will neither gain a mandate from voters nor encourage the strong leadership needed to realize their core ideals william s kessler seattle sept 26 2002
