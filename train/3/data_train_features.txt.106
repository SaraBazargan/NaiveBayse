 mantegna mystery two telephone bidders at sotheby 's yesterday morning tried to buy descent into limbo the last painting by the italian renaissance master andrea mantegna that is still in private hands george wachter director of old master paintings for sotheby 's worldwide took the winning bid for 285 million just shy of the work 's 30 million high estimate the price includes sotheby 's new buyer 's premium 20 percent of the first 100000 and 12 percent of the rest estimates do not reflect commissions the second the hammer came down the speculation started some old master dealers swore the buyer was the j paul getty museum in los angeles but scott j schaefer formerly an old master painting expert for sotheby 's and now the getty 's paintings curator was sitting in the salesroom and said the museum did not even bid another theory was that the buyer was lord thomson of fleet the former owner of the times of london and one of the richest men in canada he paid 767 million a record for an old master painting at auction for rubens 's massacre of the innocents 1609 11 at sotheby 's in london in july and then promised the painting with nearly 2000 other works in his collection to the art gallery of ontario that theory made sense until several dealers near the telephones said that they thought they had heard mr wachter speaking italian all sotheby 's would say is that the buyer wished to remain anonymous it also declined to say who sold the painting although literature about the work lists the owner as barbara piasecka johnson an internationally known collector of old master paintings who moved from princeton nj to monaco several years ago she inherited about 300 million from her husband j seward johnson sr son of the founder of the johnson johnson pharmaceutical company who died in 1983 the painting which has been exhibited in the united states and abroad depicts jesus from the back leaning on his staff by the entry to a cave in a way that instantly draws in viewer and creates an air of mystery on his left are four figures including adam and eve and to the right is a man hunched toward him strong thread peter c marzio director of the museum of fine arts houston was braced for just the kind of response he received when he approached some of his museum colleagues to see who might be interested in showing the quilts of gee 's bend a show that was in houston in the fall and is now at the whitney museum of american art through march 9 when you mention a quilt show to people they roll their eyes mr marzio said so initially he was quite happy when the show was scheduled for new york and houston but its popularity from word of mouth and rave reviews suddenly made the show a hot commodity michael kimmelman chief art critic of the new york times called the
