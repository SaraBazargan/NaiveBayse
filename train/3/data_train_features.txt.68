 an archaeological dig in andover has found remains of a medieval style long house the first one ever discovered in connecticut until now no long houses like this one 15 feet wide and 60 feet long had been found in new england dating from much past 1650 the andover house was built in 1705 historians say this long house challenges assumptions about traditional new england housing people think the typical new england house was a hall and parlor house with a central chimney but the archaeological evidence is showing us that we had a wide range of different types of houses including long houses said emerson w baker a history professor at salem state college in massachusetts dr baker an archaeologist lives in maine and is familiar with the half dozen long houses found there the andover house looked almost like a corridor said meg harper the president of public archeological survey team inc in storrs which finished excavating the site last month before it burned to the ground around 1750 the house had clapboard siding a cedar shake roof and lead lined diamond shape windowpanes imported from england the house contained small cellars at each end that were not connected a large hearth located off center and an odd secondary hearth in the west cellar that looks like a bastion at the corner of a fort ms harper said the long house form was common in western and northern england between ad 800 and 1600 and one end of the structure served as a barn for animals dr baker said the evidence in connecticut is so important because it shows that people throughout new england were building this form of architecture he said long houses have also been found in the plymouth duxbury area of massachusetts and as far south as virginia dr baker was not surprised that one turned up in connecticut i 've been predicting it for years he said nationwide about a dozen long houses have been discovered but it is likely they were once more common than that said robert blair st george a history professor at the university of pennsylvania who specializes in early american material culture and architecture they did n't survive he said i think there are a lot more literary descriptions of them but they were knocked down and not excavated the andover site was discovered during an archaeological survey required for a state road improvement project to provide safer access to route 6 by realigning lake road ms harper 's team found the edge of a stone cellar wall and some 18th century artifacts that triggered a more intensive survey and the archaeologists figured out we had an early house site and that it burned ms harper said the project historian bruce clouette determined that the house had been built by ephraim sprague a third generation colonist who came to andover from duxbury in 1703 mr clouette learned that sprague served as the captain of a local militia unit that fought indians in massachusetts from 1722 to 1725 represented the town of lebanon in the connecticut general assembly and became a deacon in the local congregational church virtually nothing is known about the lifeways of the average person coming into the frontier setting of southern new england ms harper said these are the kind of people who did not leave diaries the site was deemed eligible for the national registry of historic places which meant it could not be disturbed or destroyed unless there was no prudent alternative to the road project ms harper said since lake road could not be rerouted state department of transportation officials agreed to pay for a rare data recovery operation the department expects to spend nearly 300000 for the archaeological work data analysis and a public educational exhibit said pam rackcliffe a transportation planner in the newington office initially the archaeologists were puzzled by what the excavation turned up the original foundation 15 feet by 15 feet seemed just way too small for even a very small frontier dwelling ms harper recalled plus there was no evidence for any kind of heat source in that foundation they kept digging and 12 feet away they found evidence of ash believed to represent a large chimney base still they did n't know where the house ended so they followed a hunch we literally took the 15 foot depth multiplied it by four knowing that a long house ratio would be four to one and threw a test pit out 60 feet and landed right on the back wall at the end of the house ms harper said that back wall however was on private farmland outside the road project limits the property owner william sprague merritt unrelated to ephraim gave the archaeologists permission to dig in his cornfield last month they returned and uncovered the second cellar and its small hearth which confirmed that the building was a long house ms harper said originally ephraim sprague 's property was part of lebanon which was incorporated in 1700 three years before his arrival alicia wayland the town historian said there was hardly anything between that site and hartford it was really a wilderness area while excavating the site the archaeologists also recovered some 50000 artifacts including beads pieces of an imported china tea set spoons sewing scissors needles and thread handmade tools combs buckles from clothing and tobacco pipes finding a burned site is an archaeologist 's fantasy ms harper said because the ash creates a really favorable climate for nonburned remains her team found organic items like caches of corn and beans in a cold cellar parts of floorboards and pieces of cloth animal bone and antlers which typically deteriorate quickly in connecticut 's acidic soil on nov 29 the archaeological site was closed after a bulldozer pushed dirt back into the cellar and covered it next year ms harper said she expects to present professional papers on the site and a book size final report should be available in 2002 the site has been nominated for a prestigious federal highway administration 2001 environmental excellence award by the state department of transportation dr baker said the andover long house was important for future archaeology it forces us to look out for the unusual he said just like all the settlers in new england were not puritans not all of them lived in the same type of house
