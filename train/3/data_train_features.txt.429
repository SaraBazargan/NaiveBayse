 having succeeded in making computer memory chips consumer electronics and automobiles south korea has set its sights on a far loftier goal conquering outer space the government plans to develop a rocket capable of ferrying satellites into orbit within the next five years at a cost that space agency officials estimate at 500 million to 1 billion although independent experts said the cost could run as high as several billion dollars the project still in the planning stages represents south korea 's hope to join the elite ranks of other space faring nations and free itself from dependence on other countries to launch its satellites and provide military surveillance but united states officials have reservations about south korea 's ambitions fearing that the project may not be economically viable and that the rocket technology could be exported to countries who may use it for military applications south korea says that the project would be sufficiently financed and that the rocket technology would not be suitable for military purposes announcing the project last month president kim dae jung said that south korea would build a working satellite launching facility by the year 2005 constructed with korean technology and equipment he promised that the government would allocate enough money for the rocket program and for research and development in other high technology fields including electronics and computer software south korean space agency officials said they hope to build a world class space program and they have grand visions of one day working with the united states and other countries on projects like a reusable space shuttle and an international space station south korea 's decision to develop a satellite launching station reflects the dramatic comeback of this proud nation following the asian financial crisis which had caused the government to shelve the project as too expensive although little is known about south korea 's rocket technology some satellite experts believe that the country could produce its own satellite launching vehicles but security experts and western officials speaking on condition of anonymity expressed concern that the technology that south korea hopes to develop to to launch satellites could also be used to make long range ballistic missiles without the proper checks and balances they said other countries could view the space project as having military applications and an arms race might begin in northeast asia this type of satellite rocket technology is transferable to military applications and other countries in the region are certainly going to view south korea 's program through this prism said a united states government official who monitors missiles and weapons of mass destruction one of the reasons we are not fully pleased about countries starting up space launch programs that are not economically viable is that they could export the launching vehicle to someone else who has no intention of using it for satellites the official said under a 1979 accord with the united states south korea agreed to limit the range of its missiles to about 100 miles and promised to abide by treaty rules restricting the spread of nuclear weapons south korea has been seeking permission from the united states to increase the range of its ballistic missiles after north korea test fired a medium range missile in 1998 that flew over the japanese mainland and into the ocean at the time north korea claimed that the test launch was a multistage rocket designed to put a satellite into orbit last year north korea threatened to test fire a second missile with a much longer range but abandoned those plans after international protests and after the united states agreed to lift economic sanctions against the communist country although the united states recently agreed to increase the missile range limits for south korea to up to 180 miles korean officials want the united states to raise the missile range to 300 miles choi dong whan president of the korean aerospace research institute the government space agency said in an interview that korea 's space launching rocket program would be economically viable and that the project would not have military applications the space agency plans to develop a leaky fuel propellant rocket system that is not useful for intercontinental ballistic missiles which typically employ a solid propellant he said the south korean rocket is expected to operate at an altitude between 375 miles and 437 miles and initially would carry small satellites used for mapping coastline surveillance and weather forecasting mr choi said south korea would continue to rely on foreign firms to launch heavier communications satellites that are placed in orbit he said we do n't want to depend on other countries anymore mr choi said we pay a lot of money to outside countries and we have to wait for launching time which is dependent on their schedule and wastes our time and budget space agency officials said that south korea needs to place at least 19 new satellites in orbit by the year 2025 and that the country can build its own satellite launching pad for about the same cost of paying a foreign firm to launch four or five satellites south korea now has six satellites three for communications and broadcasting and three for scientific research and all carried into orbit abroad by foreign made rockets if its rocket is cost efficient south korea could also use the technology to compete in the lucrative commercial satellite launching business the highly competitive industry is currently dominated by three major players the boeing company 's delta rockets and lockheed martin 's atlas rockets both from the united states and ariane rockets made by the european consortium arianespace russia and china have small portions of the market but space experts said that south korea faces considerable challenges building a launching vehicle made solely with its own technology particularly in integrating the various systems of the rocket despite years of development and billions of dollars in expenditures many advanced countries still struggle to master rocket technology last month japan said that it was abandoning its troubled h 2 rocket project after a series of costly failures including the loss of an h 2 rocket that plunged into the pacific ocean shortly after takeoff in november japanese which had invested 414 billion in the program since 1986 is still investigating the cause of the rocket failure still a growing number of countries are announcing plans to build their own satellites or develop rockets to launch them partly for the prestige that comes with such capability but also for the possible commercial and technological applications more and more countries are realizing that space is really the next frontier and not just for exploration said duane brown a spokesman for national aeronautics and space administration in the united states it 's expensive and takes a lot of hard work and trial and error but space has become a global venture that makes a lot of sense
