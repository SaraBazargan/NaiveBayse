 age triumphed over relative youth unsurprisingly enough when the new york city ballet presented a diamond project revival by kevin o'day and repertory staples by jerome robbins and george balanchine on tuesday night at the new york state theater mr o'day 's viola alone created in 1994 is steeped in the shifting edginess and near serenity of its hindemith score for viola and piano the ballet consists of a series of solos and duets danced here by alexander ritter and jeroen hofmans dressed stylishly in what look like old fashioned boxers trunks and jennie somogyi and carrie lee riggins in short close fitting tunics all designed by holly hynes mr o'day blends cramped jabs with freer stage covering travel to intriguing effect in choreography danced by mr ritter and ms riggins who almost steals the show in one fierce solo statelier more resolved dancing is reserved for ms somogyi and mr hofmans you soon begin to wonder however about the point of it all as the audience cough meter rises to about an 8 out of 10 the ballet 's clever full title viola alone with one exception suggests the problem mr o'day has concentrated more on cerebral conceit than on expression the dancers sit from time to time on three chairs at the back the score is played onstage by maureen gallagher the viola soloist who joins nancy mcdill the piano soloist after a curtain raises to reveal ms mcdill the dancers partnering superficially resembles the skewed limbs and off kilter body shapes found in some choreography by peter martins there are oblique suggestions of a narrative in viola alone and in robbins 's opus 19 the dreamer an equally edgy ballet set to a slightly more mellow prokofiev score but emotions push to the surface in the robbins ballet especially as it was performed by peter boal and jenifer ringer lead dancers whose every move conveyed distillations of pain angry confusion or a hunger for connection it is much harder to care about mr o'day 's two couples either emotionally or in terms of formal values the prokofiev score was conducted by maurice kaplow with guillermo figueroa as the violin soloist balanchine 's sweeping vienna waltzes ended the evening with a flurry of exciting performances best of all was mr boal buoyant and amusing in the fruhlingsstimmen section and more treasurable with every new season alexandra ansanelli was his piquant beautifully nuanced ballerina helene alexopoulos stood out for her tantalizing world weariness as the merry widow of the gold und silber walzer section kathleen tracey was infectiously goofy in explosions polka in a lead cast completed by monique meunier robert lyon kipling houston charles askegard darci kistler and philip neal hugo fiorato conducted the score of waltzes by johann strauss ii franz lehar and richard strauss
