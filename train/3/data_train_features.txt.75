 four years ago i pointed out that no two countries that both had mcdonald 's had ever fought a war against each other since they each got their mcdonald 's i drew from that what i called the golden arches theory of conflict prevention which stated that once your country became a mcdonald 's country it meant your people did n't like to fight wars anymore they preferred instead to wait in line for burgers the golden arches theory had nothing to do with the power of burgers i was simply using it to illustrate that while globalization and economic integration symbolized by the spread of mcdonald 's could not end geopolitics and war they were clearly having a restraining effect on aggressive nations in addition to classical military deterrence because the costs of war for globalized nations were now so much greater well the golden arches theory is now about to get its first real test china versus taiwan these are two separate countries each obsessed with asserting its own national identity but each now woven to the other and to the rest of the world by a web of economic interests and 578 mcdonald 's so profound and far reaching that if this web ca n't restrain them then nothing will consider the following some 40 percent of all chinese exports go to the us over 25 percent of china 's gdp comes from foreign trade taiwanese companies have invested 40 billion in factories on mainland china china is fast becoming one of the most internet wired countries in the world taiwanese factories are the leading suppliers in the world of 13 key parts that go into every computer or internet router in many cases taiwan is the only supplier of certain key computer parts the whole global computer supply chain would be disrupted by a war over taiwan bye bye nasdaq in short it 's hard to find two more globally and mutually dependent countries but it 's also hard to find two countries more viscerally committed to their own particular national identities and to the flourishing of their own particular roots and branches communist china covets taiwan in order to complete the historic reunification of china now that hong kong and macao have been reintegrated and taiwan 's election has brought to power there for the first time a leader who represents the yearning of taiwanese to govern themselves and to never again be ruled by others china ca n't shoot taiwan without shooting itself taiwan ca n't pull away from china without pulling its own economy down and any sharp move by either will destabilize the world that 's what globalization is all about think about it americans will not and should not stand by and watch taiwan a country shaped in our own image be snuffed out by beijing a china that invades taiwan is a china that can forget about selling goods in america for a long time it 's a china that can forget about joining the world trade organization will rationality prevail the problem with beijing taiwan and washington says the china scholar mike oksenberg is that each assumes that economic rationality will prevail in the other two capitals and that the other two will understand the political pressures in its own capital and therefore cut it some slack that 's a dangerous assumption china scholars note that when china 's progressive prime minister zhu rongji threatened taiwan last week against making any move toward independence there was a certain pleading quality to it almost as though mr zhu was saying do n't you guys understand i 'm sitting on a powderkeg the whole scene echoed that day in 1989 when the chinese leader at the time zhao ziyang went to tiananmen square and pleaded with tears in his eyes for the students to leave because he knew what demons lurked inside his own politburo well those demons those chinese leaders whose motto is when in doubt use force are still there but china has become a real mcdonald 's country since and this is a test of whose logic will prevail there is a war just waiting to be fought in the taiwan strait but there is also a nobel peace prize just waiting to be won there waiting for the statesman who can persuade the parties that precisely because they ca n't live without each other they have to find a new way to live with each other i repeat this is a test
