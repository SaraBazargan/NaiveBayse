presentation a strong emotional and visual impact ms iturbide 's dedication to portraying indigenous mexican peoples which she has been doing since the early stages of her career in the 1970 's continues an important tradition yet the intensity of her images removes her projects from what once might have been termed cultural documentation and makes them seem more of an effort to insist on identity and to do it with compelling urgency titled images of the spirit the retrospective frequently depicts mystical practices blending with everyday life included are rituals involving death angels and devotional beliefs the portraits magnolia with a face reflected in a hand held mirror and na marcelina with its central figure flanked by iconic images are among the photographs showing votive materials the work is highly concentrated and uses the sharp focus silhouetting radical simplification and dramatic light contrasts possible with black and white film the artistry lends

connotes paris circa 1900 to lucinda devlin 's penitentiary electric chair in a white box of a room to ezra stoller 's landmark airline terminal images that celebrate the abstract properties of curving architectural components caitlin masley 's photograph of a ceiling light fixture against a soft field of color is the show 's most recent piece and one of the most compelling removed from its full context the image seems to vibrate in haunting space setting up a slow sequence of perceptual sensations and inviting imaginary ideas about location time and memory are involved too in andrew bordwin 's house viewed from an angle so casual as to seem like a random recollection then printed on absorbent paper to create the blur associated with distant experiences in addition to the atget and stoller photographs the exhibition also includes works by bernd and hilla becher that are widely appreciated as classics their black and white stark image of a blast furnace with ladders pipes and
