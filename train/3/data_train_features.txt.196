 democratic gains in the house and senate on tuesday fell short of control but produced the most narrowly divided congress in almost half a century democrats gained at least three senate seats and one or two in the house with one senate race undecided republicans had 50 seats and democrats 49 in the house republicans won an apparent majority of 221 to 211 with 2 independents and one seat undecided with the democratic candidate leading but republicans asserted that recounts or absentee ballots would give them two or three of the seats where democrats now had more votes and democrats predicted that a recount would get them one republican seat the last time both houses were so closely divided was at the end of the 83rd congress of 1953 55 when republicans ended with a 49 to 46 senate edge with 1 independent and the house had 219 republicans 215 democrats and 1 independent but that was an entirely different era when lawmakers drank and golfed together and when blunt partisanship as seen in today 's attack advertisements was almost unheard of a widely recalled saying of the time has a senior democrat correcting a freshman who called house republicans the enemy the elder democrat explained the republicans are the opposition the senate is the enemy there were some bows to the older spirit yesterday senator john ashcroft of missouri the republican who was narrowly beaten by the late mel carnahan after his widow agreed to accept appointment if he won rejected any legal challenge to the result saying i believe that the will of the people has been expressed with compassion and the will of the people should be respected but more typical was the sort of call for bipartisanship made by senator robert g torricelli of new jersey head of the democrats senate campaign committee republicans must recognize mr torricelli said that there is no constituency in this country for stopping progress on prescription drugs or hiring new teachers or defeating the building of new schools senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky who heads the senate republican campaign committee brushed off mr torricelli 's call for new campaign finance legislation saying democrats would love to cripple the parties because they have allies in the afl cio and the sierra club similarly representative thomas m davis iii of virginia head of the house republican campaign committee said cooperation was possible if democrats abandoned their recent stands the democratic leadership did not want the house republicans to get credit for anything mr davis said i think they were willing to kill a pretty good deal and not get anything i hope that will end he also taunted democrats by saying that a few of their members whom he did not name had talked to him about switching parties the senate results followed a pattern widely anticipated in recent weeks democrats won five republican seats defeating incumbents in delaware michigan minnesota and missouri and winning the republican seat in florida opened up by connie mack 's retirement they could still win one more because several thousand absentee ballots in washington state may overcome senator slade gorton 's current 3197 vote margin and give the seat to maria cantwell a former democratic representative but even if ms cantwell wins and the senate is divided 50 to 50 republicans would be in control if gov george w bush of texas is elected his vice president dick cheney would cast a tie breaking 101st vote to give republicans control if vice president al gore wins senator joseph i lieberman re elected to the senate on tuesday would resign to become vice president and a republican would be appointed to succeed him breaking the tie republicans held on to the majority they won in 1994 by taking the democratic seat in nevada that was vacated by the retirement of richard bryan and by ousting senator charles s robb the two term democrat in virginia democrats retained several seats that had been jeopardized by retirements in new york new jersey and nebraska republicans held on in one tough race in which senator conrad burns of montana overcame a challenge that was largely focused on the prescription drug issue a comparable even stronger fire wall preserved republican control of the house republicans aimed at and won seats opened up by democratic retirements in michigan missouri pennsylvania virginia and west virginia and by the defeat of representative michael forbes democrat of long island in the primary republicans also defeated two incumbents who had not been serious targets early representatives sam gejdenson in connecticut and david minge in minnesota jim wilkinson a spokesman for the republican campaign committee said yesterday that republicans were confident that further counting would erase the 56 vote lead held last night by representative rush d holt a democrat in new jersey democrats had singled out republicans in florida illinois ohio and pennsylvania but in the end they took only one republican seat east of the mississippi that seat was vacated by representative rick a lazio who lost new york 's senate race to hillary rodham clinton they picked up five seats in california one was easy for no republican was running in the 31st district which had swung to the republicans only briefly when representative matthew g martinez switched parties after losing the democratic primary three republican incumbents lost in california representatives james e rogan brian p bilbray and steven t kuykendall representative jay dickey of arkansas also lost and four democrats won seats vacated by retiring republicans they were jim matheson in utah brad carson in oklahoma rick larsen in washington and mike honda in california democrats also said they hoped recounts would give elaine bloom a victory in florida over representative e clay shaw jr and do the same for dianne byrum a michigan state senator who held a victory party before the final count favored mike rogers the republican candidate representative richard a gephardt of missouri the minority leader who would have become speaker had the democrats won held out hope yesterday for an eventual democratic gain of up to four seats mr gephardt also told reporters he had called speaker j dennis hastert to congratulate him the two men had not spoken since june those months of silence reflect the difference between attitudes today and the last time the congress was so narrowly divided in the old days said norman j ornstein a congressional scholar at the american enterprise institute in washington partisanship existed and did not dominate the congress he said political fights then were local you did n't have tom davis or bob torricelli putting together ads to be used across the country to condemn candidates sometimes for taking positions that mr davis or mr torricelli themselves supported what this does is to create a bitterness among people who get elected against the party itself and not just the guy who runs against you
