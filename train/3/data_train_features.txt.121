 after president clinton 's motorcade swept out of the gates of vietnam national university here on friday an impromptu teach in began on the steps of the lecture hall as american reporters quizzed vietnamese students about their reaction to mr clinton 's speech more than once the students deftly turned the tables questioning the visitors about their country tell me about your system of higher education said anh le 20 an english student whose unflinching gaze suggested she would not accept a token response i have to give a presentation to my class the two reporters speaking to her shifted from foot to foot offering some thoughts about the number of foreign students on scholarships and trying to evoke the atmosphere of an american campus how can we go to these places she asked mobility is not the same in vietnam as it is in the united states her comments said much about the lure of the united states for young vietnamese but in the soft evening air there were hard reminders that vietnam remains a closed society unnecessary chaperones whenever the exchanges grew animated well dressed men with wide smiles sauntered over and offered to translate since the students spoke english the offers were gratuitous but they were enough to shut down one young woman who had seemed eager to discuss mr clinton 's remarks about civil liberties not everyone needed an official from the interior ministry to act as a chaperone nguyen hoang lien 26 an environmental science student dismissed the president 's comments on political freedom as irrelevant since the 1930 's we have had only one political party in this country she said matter of factly all vietnamese agree with this bill clinton rock star pick up any local newspaper here and one would conclude that mr clinton 's visit is groundbreaking a landmark and any other word that means really important but one would have no clue that mr clinton is being treated like a rock star by people in the streets most papers have covered only the formal meetings between the president and senior vietnamese officials while a few reported on mr clinton 's speech at vietnam national university they quoted sparingly from it and carried no reaction from students or anyone else who heard it two tabloids did offer a glimpse of mr clinton 's charm offensive they ran a picture of him standing on a balcony stretching to clasp the hands of delighted children in the house next door reporters at the vietnam news the english language daily said there was no suspense about how their editors would play the trip visiting heads of state are memorialized on the top left hand side of the front page the article is always accompanied by a picture of the vip with vietnam 's president on friday true to form the newspaper featured an article in that space under the headline us president 's visit hailed as new landmark in bilateral ties the photograph showed mr clinton and the vietnamese president tran duc luong reviewing an honor guard at the presidential palace the last head of state to get such play was from luxembourg and the first lady hillary rodham clinton 's foreign trips have something of a routine and today as she has in more than 20 countries the first lady was host to a forum of women who are leaders here aides to mrs clinton say these events are hit or miss for every stimulating discussion there is a stilted encounter today probably rated as a miss despite a formidable lineup of business people educators and government officials the discussion never got off the ground instead the panelists read long statements many of which simply affirmed that equality of the sexes is enshrined in vietnam 's constitution after listening for more than an hour mrs clinton looked like a senator sitting through a filibuster let me thank the panelists for a thorough discussion of the issues she said with noticeable exasperation mrs clinton took mild issue with the assertion that women have equal rights in vietnam merely because equality is guaranteed in the constitution but she seemed eager to explore the role that women play in the vietnamese economy and society which is greater than in many countries what is different is there is a history of women working alongside men fighting alongside men mrs clinton said diplomatic chuckle at one point during his travels president clinton chatted with a reporter about warren m christopher his former secretary of state who opened diplomatic relations with vietnam on a trip to the country in 1995 i bet chris wishes he was back here right now mr clinton said with a chuckle mr christopher of course is in a quagmire halfway around the world leading vice president al gore 's battle to determine who won the state of florida and the right to succeed mr clinton
