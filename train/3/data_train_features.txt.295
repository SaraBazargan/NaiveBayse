 as i get older i am more and more interested in the bones of a garden the paths and walls the little low hedges of boxwood outlining an herb garden or walkway to a front door i keep looking at the tall red cedar that marks the brow of a field on our land and pondering where i might plant a few cedars of my own a little group of them perhaps by an old foundation that for a few years has cradled my compost pile you should make that your herb garden my friend betty told me the last time she dropped by it 's sunny and protected and it would look beautiful as you walked up from the barn betty is a landscape architect so she sees shapes and forms and connections from one area to another where others see only what is already there so now i watch the sun arcing over this spot noting where the shadows fall trying to gauge if a few red cedars planted on the southwest corner would allow sun loving herbs enough light yes i think so i like the ideas of birds singing from the branches of those cedars and of snow outlining their limbs i am doing the same thing with other parts of the old barn that will soon be my house i may mark a doorway with an alberta spruce picea glauca albertiana because as it grows its rumpled shape and dense little needles take on an almost animistic presence i 'm planting some climbing roses a climbing hydrangea a pyracantha up some of the walls and over certain doorways in winter the climbing hydrangea 's shaggy brown vines will crisscross the concrete walls of the old dairy and its twiggy growth will provide more shelter for the birds inside the old barnyard wall which holds the heat of the winter sun i want to plant a japanese apricot prunus mume whose fragrant winter flowers open as early as february or march while many trees and shrubs including roses do well planted in the fall fruit trees fare better planted in early spring this is the time to order them while there are plenty in stock to be delivered in early march i find myself poring over books like rosemary verey 's garden in winter timber press 1995 where cotoneaster horizontalis pictured covered with red berries is clipped to frame a doorway and the windows of a house that sits right on the street two clipped box honeysuckles lonicera nitida flank the same front door acting as a kind of soft green ballast to the crimson berries which offer a warm welcome to passers by i have ordered a few witch hazels like hamamelis mollis the chinese witch hazel which will bloom in february on a mild day if i plant it in full sun and put it close to the house where its fragrance can waft in the window mollis is a striking species with open arching branches as it matures h mollis pallida is a hybrid with larger more fragrant yellow flowers that dangle from the bare branches jelena is another fragrant witch hazel with coppery twisted petals that can add a touch of warm fire to the winter garden winter yellow jasmine jasminum nudiflorum has very early flowers and though they are n't fragrant their appearance in mid winter signals the coming of spring do n't forget to plant a few thousand more little bulbs under these shrubs and evergreens a sea of pale pink crocus tomasinianus looks glorious under the dark trunk of a beech tree or in a small garden under the contorted branches of harry lauder 's walking stick corylus avellana contorta which blooms by the way in late february or march so as you are cleaning up the garden this fall think in pictures i am thinking of putting a few willows salix alba britzensis in a low lying little swale that catches the rain and stays wetter than most parts of my yard the curving young stems of this variety are golden with amber centers and if you cut the shrub back each spring after its catkins bloom the shoots will grow all summer and fall and by winter glow in the sun the winterberries are another old standby essential for the birds since the bright red fruits cling to branches long into winter i 'm going to plant two together this year ilex verticillata winter gold which has salmon orange berries alongside winter red which has crimson fruit evergreens shrubs and hardwoods will thank you for a fall planting their roots still have time to get established before the hard freeze make sure you dig an adequate hole with well draining soil and water regularly if it does n't rain two mail order sources for a wide variety of plants are heronswood nursery 7530 288th street ne kingston wash 98346 360 297 4172 catalog 5 wwwheronswoodcom and forest farm 990 tetherow road williams ore 97544 541 846 7269 catalog 5 www forestfarmcom
