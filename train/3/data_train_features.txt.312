 day after day after day i stand staring at the posters for the missing i see them all over town but only in my own neighborhood do i stand and stare every day in front of the hospital the supermarket the bus shelter by now they are my intimates when i do n't know what to do with myself and that 's quite often these days they are the company i seek out late last week i looked around and saw that i was not alone in this practice day after day the same faces had been gathered around the posters at the same odd hours as me 4 in the afternoon midnight as though these people too when they did n't know what to do with themselves sought the same company what is this i thought why do we keep coming back only now do i think i can answer this question at 9 30 am on sept 11 i stood across the street from my house on the corner of 12th street and seventh avenue in a silent crowd watching the world trade center burn within minutes the neighborhood was a war zone sirens screaming down the avenue st vincent 's hospital wheeling a row of beds onto the pavement people lining up to give blood and it remained one for a week avenues closed to traffic except for police cars and ambulances television trucks parked outside emergency admitting klieg lights on day and night and most dreamlike the need to show id if you wanted to get back home from a trip above 14th street it felt as though we had been quarantined it still feels that way and i like it i like feeling quarantined down here in the village the world has become a painful abstraction only the streets that i know seem to give comfort it was in this mood that the posters plastered over hospital walls on every lamppost and bus shelter across the plate glass windows of the food emporium began to acquire power over me at first i looked upon them only as a horrifying record of the unimaginable loss of life we have sustained uniform in meaning then i began to see them differently it was the details that were making them remarkable often a poster presents itself simply just a photo and vital statistics but even more often the description begins to fill itself in in the oddest of ways we learn of dyed yellow hair a dropped right eyelid two fingers missing a badly knit appendix scar john doherty gray hair glasses sober black suit has a strawberry birthmark on his back eric bennett wide grin on his face deep stretch marks in both armpits chunky ruben esquilin is hemophiliac then there are the clothes bob levinson 102nd floor tower 1 was wearing black slacks and a blue striped shirt he usually wears sunglasses but on the 11th he left them home and the jewelry an enamel necklace with a religious photo a wedding band of brushed gold with four to six channel set diamonds and the tattoos casey cho has a dragon down the middle of her back with a chinese character in red eric bennett a bulldog on his right shoulder michelle reed a spider web on her right big toe in a change of pace i am told only that handsome fitzroy st rose is missing from the 83rd floor please call six 718 numbers are listed or i am being asked have you seen joseph roberto 85th floor tower 2 not another word only the photograph of a face of startling kindness looking directly at me these are the details that compel my attention but what holds it day after day poster after poster are the revisions always in parentheses penciled or inked in like the news about eric bennett 's deep stretch marks or the observation that jim oakley 's tattoos are poorly done as for nancy ngo we are told she is wearing a jade necklace and a wedding ring with nick on the inside then in parenthesis is added diamond stud earrings the poster that drives all this home is for colleen supinski 27 last seen on the 104th floor of tower 2 she has we are told by her relative noreen supinski whom we are to call large blue eyes long thick eyelashes long blond hair tiny wrists and fingers small frame petite features small gap between upper two front teeth and oh yes a small flower tattoo on right lower abd then beside the sentence about the tattoo penciled in is all black i have this image it 's with me often as i go about the day of noreen reviewing her composition extraordinary enough with its long thick eyelashes and tiny wrists nodding walking away and then like any writer driven to self correction coming back no that 's not right she thinks it needs a few more words only a few more and it will have delivered itself of its task it 's the narrative drive behind the posters that holds me the one releasing itself in details and revisions that impulse to get it right make the words register the vital distinction insist that clarity of thought matters the relief i feel in its presence the relief we all feel that the city feels when the first plane drove itself into the trade center it was as though the narrating intelligence of the race had ceased to exist but when noreen supinksi returned to her poster to pencil in all black its life was secured that i think is why we hover around these computer generated pieces of paper and why they are becoming artifacts ten days after the attack there was a sign on the suddenly bare northern wall of st vincent 's announcing that the posters were being moved to preserve them from the weather friends tell me that similar action is being taken all over town first
