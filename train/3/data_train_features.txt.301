 to the editor in the damaged spirit of the sept 11 fund op ed jan 18 fred price and mitch kleinman argue that the rules of the federal victims compensation fund are flawed they are right but their solution pushes the balance of compensation further in the wrong direction they advocate compensation based on potential lifetime earnings meaning that a 25 year old stockbroker with an ivy league degree would receive far more compensation than a 50 year old janitor but this does not compensate families for their actual losses but rather rewards those who happened to be young members of a who 's who of the financial sector it also tends to reward those who had the financial resources to get advanced degrees a group that will not be reflective of the racial and ethnic backgrounds of the victims as a whole in life stockbrokers and lawyers may have been worth more financially than janitors and secretaries but in death we are all equal the fairest way to distribute the compensation fund is to recognize that equality and begin compensation from a baseline of an equal division jason gottlieb new york jan 18 2002
