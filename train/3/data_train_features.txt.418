 directed by nigel noble not rated 70 minutes without getting into the guns and butter details of economic theory nigel noble 's bluntly downbeat documentary the charcoal people presents a hard headed picture of how the laws of supply and demand in brazil are contributing to the destruction of the amazon rain forest charcoal people is the nickname for thousands of migrant workers across the country who earn a meager living making the charcoal that is an ingredient of the pig iron used in brazil 's steel industry about half the wood used to produce charcoal comes from eucalyptus plantations the other half comes from cutting and burning timber in the rain forest whose leveling has already decimated an area the size of france much of the film which opens today at the screening room 54 varick street tribeca takes an up close view of impoverished migrant workers and their families desperate for money these uneducated laborers whose dream is to save enough to somehow become independent are willing to travel anywhere where there is money to be made producing charcoal many of them send home money to families they have left behind and are unable to visit for years at a stretch the film documents the process by which whole forests are reduced to blocks of charred timber the timber is shipped by truck to work camps where it is fed into rows of giant kilns it takes a day to build one that resemble brick and mortar igloos high among the hazards the workers must contend with are the infernal heat and choking smoke generated by the kilns as the workers tell their stories the struggles they describe are n't all that different from those of exploited laborers all over the world be they coal miners or sweat shop employees those who ask for raises are often considered troublemakers and fired one worker recalls a boss who kept the workers in debt by forcing them to buy their supplies from the company store not all the testimony is meant to appall more than one person interviewed actually finds some satisfaction in the work the cost to the environment of course is steep just how steep is suggested late in the film by aerial shots of a hideously scarred smoky section of rain forest but the movie leaves little doubt that as long as there is an industry hungry for their labor the charcoal people and the destruction they wreak will continue stephen holden
