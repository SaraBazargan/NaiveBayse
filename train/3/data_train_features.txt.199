 as stars of the show athletes gathering here for the winter olympics want for nothing that includes condoms they are free for the asking where athletes live and where they compete in many places it would not be a big deal vital for safe sex condoms are distributed by cities and school systems all across the country they have been provided at every olympics since 1992 including the summer games of 2000 in sydney australia where more than 70000 condoms in a rainbow of colors were distributed to athletes some countries exhausted their supply but here in utah a conservative and largely mormon state that requires parents to give written permission for their children to attend classes when human sexuality and reproduction are discussed the availability of free condoms is a big deal big enough that generation life an anti abortion group promoting sexual abstinence before marriage plans five days of protests during the olympics which start next friday brandi swindell the group 's director said we want to expose the horrific realities of abortion tie in our message of chastity and tell people that condoms are not that safe it is the kind of message that city officials worry might spoil the enjoyment for some olympic visitors even if the more conservative residents of the state agree with ms swindell 's position state senator bill wright a republican who represents one of the most conservative areas in utah a region south of provo criticized olympic leaders and by extension athletes for a program that he contended conveyed a cavalier approach to sex it 's atrocious that the organizing committee has come to this mr wright said through a spokesman they should be mature adults who represent their countries in an honest and respectful manner i do n't think this is the way to do it vania grandi a spokeswoman for the organizing committee said an olympic sponsor cardinal health inc of dublin ohio had donated the 12000 condoms that would be available free in clinics at the 10 competition sites and the complex where the athletes would live we 're not distributing them ms grandi said they 're available like aspirin tylenol and bandages it 's good public health policy mr wright has been a leading force in the state to tighten laws that make utah one of the most restrictive states in the nation in how sex education is taught in public schools in every school district parents are asked to designate subjects they do not want their children learning about in the classroom including sexual abstinence human reproduction reproductive anatomy physiology marriage pregnancy childbirth parenthood contraception and sexually transmitted diseases in addition state law prohibits the classroom discussion of other sex related subjects including contraceptive methods intercourse homosexuality and erotic behavior an aide to mr wright said the senator intended to introduce legislation this year that would shift control of sex education to local school boards to give parents even more control over what their children were taught efforts like those ms swindell said convinced her that many local residents would support her group 's message at the olympics with conservatives this absolutely resonates vicky l dahn director of curriculum and educational technology for the state office of education said of the opposition to the condoms they firmly believe in abstinence before marriage in their minds there is no gray area but others in the salt lake area applaud olympic organizers for the condom program describing it as a good public health policy and proper use of athletes as role models they strongly believe condoms promote promiscuity karrie galloway chief executive of planned parenthood of utah said of the state 's powerful conservative lawmakers the saddest part is that responsible use of contraception prevents abortion and decreases the likelihood of unintended pregnancies but they do n't teach that in the schools most of the 3500 olympic athletes from 84 countries are staying in dormitories at the university of utah several miles from downtown salt lake city some of them are quite young including two 16 year old women who are members of the united states team lyndsay walls of churchville ny a hockey player and sarah hughes of great neck ny a figure skater for security the athletes quarters known as the olympic village are fenced off from the general population but organizers have provided everything for them including game rooms restaurants a health center where condoms are free and a store where they can be purchased several athletes said this week that they believed that providing free condoms made sense because most of olympic athletes were young and unmarried and many were sexually active nikola sudova 19 a free style skier from the czech republic said her sport was populated by many athletes her age who tended to be friends more than lovers but maybe it is a good thing she said stefan georgiev 24 an alpine skier from bulgaria said you have people from so many nations here not only america it would be better if they use condoms vuk radjenovic 18 a member of yugoslavia 's bobsled team eagerly endorsed the condom policy it 's a very good idea a very very good idea he said today is a very nasty time for diseases and there will be a lot of parties in the olympic village i suppose it 's a natural thing sex but you must be careful
