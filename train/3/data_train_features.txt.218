 mayor rudolph w giuliani said yesterday that his administration 's new plan to close the fresh kills landfill and ship the city 's trash from existing waterfront stations would reduce truck traffic and not unfairly burden any city neighborhood city council leaders also praised the plan and promised to work to approve it quickly speaker peter f vallone and other council members had criticized mr giuliani 's original plan which would have created a garbage station in red hook to handle 12000 tons of garbage a day the new plan would abandon such large scale waste plants in exchange for trucking the garbage to the city 's eight existing marine transfer stations from which the garbage would then be shipped out of state those stations were originally built to help ship garbage to the fresh kills landfill which by state law must close in 2002 it 's a very sensible plan mr giuliani said it 's an environmentally sound plan it does n't add any burdens any place and it allows us to solve this even earlier than we thought the city 's sanitation department will formally present details of the plan to the city council on wednesday if the council approves the plan it would be sent to the state for review the benefits and burdens of this plan are divided equally mr vallone said i think most people will accept it the mayor has come so far in our direction that we should n't have any major stumbling blocks council leaders and administration officials estimate that disposing of residential garbage under the proposed plan will cost 95 a ton the city now pays 50 to 70 per ton for trash disposal but city officials said costs were rising rapidly and that carting garbage out of the city by truck would not save money in the long run the bottom line is the cost compares favorably said martha hirst a deputy commissioner at the sanitation department this is a terribly efficient system to use just tip and go under this plan all the residential waste will leave new york city by barge or rail the plan calls for new transfer stations at the fresh kills landfill and on the queens bank of newtown creek the newtown creek station would handle the 1000 tons per day of queens garbage that is now shipped to greenpoint brooklyn the city would also renovate an existing transfer station in the south bronx and expand one near the southwest brooklyn incinerator in gravesend under the plan the city would demolish the shuttered incinerator the success of the plan hinges on an agreement with linden nj to handle 10000 tons of new york city 's garbage every day the linden city council has approved the plan though it must still win the approval of the state department of environmental protection charles j crane a member of the linden city council and the union county utilities authority praised the transfer station plan which he said would provide his city with a 13 million annual payment and help revitalize the city 's industrial base he said he thought governor christine todd whitman would give the plan her blessing the transfer station is located on the arthur kill away from residential areas mr crane said i do n't see it why it should be controversial this is the kind of thing governor whitman has been looking for to take care of our declining cities efforts to reach a spokesman for governor whitman last night by phone were unsuccessful stanley e michels the chairman of the new york city council 's environmental protection committee said the agreement with linden required study but he added that it was important to quickly end the carting of residential garbage by truck we need to implement this plan as soon as possible to reduce the time we have to be under the interim plan mr michels said
