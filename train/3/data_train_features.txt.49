 in a crackdown on persisting fire safety violations at new jersey 's 31 public universities and colleges gov christine todd whitman has threatened to withhold state aid from any college that fails to make substantial progress in correcting violations by mid march a day after state inspectors revealed that they had found 828 fire code infractions at seton hall university last month following a fatal fire the governor revealed today that some of the state 's institutions of higher education had also been cited for fire code violations in recent months and had been slow to remedy them mrs whitman wrote to the presidents of the 31 institutions on feb 18 warning of cuts in state aid unless the schools made major strides in eliminating the violations in 30 days i know that you share my concern for ensuring the safety of individuals on your campus and i urge you to ensure that all violations are addressed expeditiously her letter said jayne o'connor a spokeswoman for the governor declined to identify the schools that had been lax in remedying violations for the most part they are minor like light bulbs burned out on exit signs ms o'connor said of the infractions mrs whitman ordered a general review of the state colleges adherence to state fire safety laws after an intense smoky fire in a third floor dormitory lounge killed 3 students and injured 58 others on jan 19 at seton hall a roman catholic university in south orange nj it was not immediately clear how old the infractions mrs whitman cited were inspectors from the state 's division of fire safety are required to visit the 31 institutions each year and examine their adherence to the state fire code similar inspections at new jersey 's private universities and colleges are by law to be conducted annually by local fire officials certified as fire code inspectors by the state 's department of community affairs which oversees the fire safety division but a team of 10 state inspectors began a campuswide evaluation at seton hall in early february after officials of the fire safety division visited boland hall the dormitory where the fire occurred and found violations the state team also stepped in because officials in south orange could not produce complete reports of the village 's annual inspections at seton hall for most years after 1984 when state law first required the inspections said charles richman an assistant commissioner for the department of community affairs mr richman said yesterday that department officials were concerned about both the depth and scope of past inspections at seton hall of the 828 violations the team reported finding in seton hall 's buildings mr richman said that many appeared to be so called maintenance violations that had accumulated undetected for a period of time common maintenance problems the reports cited were burned out light bulbs in exit signs missing fire extinguishers illegal extension cords multi plug electrical strips and lint in exhaust vents but the reports also cited potentially more hazardous problems including hallway and stairway doors at boland hall that did not comply with the fire code the boland report said that many interior stairways in the dorm were not equipped with the proper doors which are designed to withstand fire for an hour and keep flames and smoke from entering stairwells stairway doors did not open outward into stairways as required by the code the report said in addition the report said doors to students rooms and stairways in boland did not have the required automatic closing devices that force them shut after students pass through state officials would not say whether any violation was a factor in the fatal fire but a fire safety expert raymond mcfarlane chairman of the fire technology program at miramar college in san diego said today that stairway doors that open inward toward hallways could trap people trying to flee smoke and flames it 's a big problem if you get people pushing up against the door and there 's a panicked feeling and people are pushing up behind you and you ca n't get that door open said mr mcfarlane a former new york city fire lieutenant the state inspectors did not cite similar door violations in seton hall 's five other dormitories although the report on boland hall said the three door violations were common throughout the six story building inspectors could not be certain the improper doors existed near the third floor lounge that burned said e j miranda a spokesman for the community affairs department mr miranda said state inspectors were not permitted into the fire scene because it had been sealed by essex county authorities investigating the fire charlotte smith a spokeswoman for donald c campolo the essex county prosecutor who is heading the investigation said yesterday that officials had not yet determined if the fire was an accident or intentionally set mr richman declined yesterday to speculate on whether any of the improper doors in boland had contributed to the spread of smoke and fire he said the state inspectors would offer their opinions if mr campolo asked for them lisa grider a spokeswoman for seton hall said yesterday that university officials were baffled by the state 's report of 828 violations including the improper doors in boland because the department of community affairs conducted inspections at seton hall in 1996 and found less than 10 violations in all its buildings ms grider said all had been repaired in response mr richman said he believed that ms grider was referring to an inspection by the department 's bureau of housing which investigates the structural soundness of buildings but does not look for violations of the state fire code
