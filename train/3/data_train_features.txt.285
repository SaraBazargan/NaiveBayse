 there is still time to start seeds of warm season vegetables like tomatoes peppers and eggplant indoors even as you plant cool season vegetables outdoors plant bare root roses soak roots at least four hours adding a tablespoon of fish emulsion fertilizer per gallon of water set in a hole wide enough to accommodate roots when spread out add compost and water scratch a teaspoon of epsom salts into the soil to encourage flower development repair bare spots in lawns with drought  and heat tolerant seeds where you are not seeding spread corn gluten meal which is nontoxic to reduce germination of common weeds like crab grass plantain and dandelion apply a balanced organic fertilizer with spring bulbs at peak bloom this is a good time to take note of gaps in the display so that in autumn you can fill in without slicing through bulbs already planted drive small stakes into the ground to mark bare spots where you want to plant use colored stakes to correspond to specific bulb species that bloom in early mid and late season this is especially useful when you are orchestrating bulbs naturalized in lawns patricia jonas
