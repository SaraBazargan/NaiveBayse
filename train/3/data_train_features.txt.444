 to the editor re raising shutterbugs in a megapixel age may 23 i teach digital imaging to students at eisenhower middle school in wyckoff nj based on my experiences with over 300 students i beg to differ with the assertion of fatima nejame executive director of the palm beach photographic center in delray beach fla that there is no magic in the computer the computer 's digital darkroom is equally if not more engaging than a traditional darkroom my students start the course with great excitement about having the freedom to roam the school and take pictures by the end of the course once they have learned how to alter and manipulate digital images i have to tear them away from the computer screen because they are so involved with the magic of their digital darkroom digital imaging gives students the opportunity to be incredibly imaginative and continually explore and reinvent their world you can see examples of their work at wwwwyckoffschoolsorg eisenhower teachers olejarz digitalimaging indexhtml harold olejarz tenafly nj
