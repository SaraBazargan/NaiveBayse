 it is sometimes said that the sins of the father will be visited upon the son so apparently may the syntax as gov george w bush of texas campaigns furiously through this state in the final days leading up to its caucuses on monday he is amassing examples of twisted verbiage and oratorical bloopers that bring to mind his famously tongue tied father 's forays into linguistic limbo the most memorable one came friday night as he addressed a crowd in council bluffs mr bush was entering the span of his speech in which he normally compares the foreign policy paradigm of yesteryear when the country 's enemy was the soviet union with the situation today when threats are less predictable but he skidded off the rails and into a bog of free floating pronouns and absent antecedents when i was coming up the texas governor said it was a dangerous world and we knew exactly who the they were it was us versus them and it was clear who them was today we 're not so sure who the they are but we know they 're there mr bush also caromed through a standard riff about how well his wife laura reflects on him if people can judge me on the company i keep mr bush said they would judge me with keeping really good company with laura the previous day in pella family values and grammatical ones diverged when mr bush touted parenthood by saying that he and mrs bush understood that their most important job is not to be governor or first lady in my case that followed a fanciful twist to an oft used metaphor about giving people in china a whiff of freedom or letting them breathe freedom in des moines he got carried away with his oxygenated example and described the heady possibilities when you inhale freedom mr bush is also fond of saying that free trade and the internet will let freedom 's genie out of the bottle call it the aladdin doctrine
