 what were we doing here we were sitting on hard wooden chairs at tables covered in brown paper at a restaurant that did n't take reservations or credit cards was situated behind a bakery and where patrons had to go next door to use the restrooms what were we doing we were enjoying one of the best meals of the year this was not just any casual cafe but the panini cafe at diane 's in roslyn that is diane as in trattoria diane one of the island 's top restaurants the food at the new spot comes from that same exalted kitchen indeed john durkin the chef owner made frequent forays into our cozy quarters bringing free tidbits for diners to try a crisp wafer thin smoked mozzarella pizza one night triangles of crisply fried mozzarella sandwiches another warm doughnut holes rolled in cinnamon sugar or tiny samples of fudgy brownies with a mini scoop of banana ice cream at the end of the meal the panini cafe is very casual at breakfast and lunch with counter service only patrons order a crisp panino pizza or pasta or choose from an array of salads sold by the pound at dessert time they wander into the bakery at the front of the building and choose a brownie or other goodie to take back to their table at night the lights are lowered votive candles add a bit of atmosphere and there is waitress service the staff members are sweet and professional they aim to please if diners prefer they can order from the trattoria diane menu the space is simple yet pleasant made even more so by shiny buckets filled with daisies but the panini cafe is not about superior servers or charming surroundings it 's about tip top food at rock bottom prices the highest priced menu item is baby lamb chops at 16 most of the food is casual fare panini at 8 bruschetta 6 to 8 salads 6 to 9 and pastas 10 to 12 additional casual offerings like a cheese plate and prosciutto with fresh figs are available they call out for a glass of wine and there are 15 offered by the glass a list of 75 bottles from next door is brought on request begin the meal with bruschetta i thought the traditional version four grilled slices of bread with chopped tomatoes and basil was super then i tasted the even better rendition with fava beans a ragout of wild mushrooms was another stellar possibility as was a marriage of prosciutto fig jam and gorgonzola which revealed a tasty counterpoint of sweet and salty salads also made a good showing especially the mound of arugula over prosciutto surrounded by roasted figs with melted gorgonzola caps the seafood salad was a dream come true big chunks of lobster firm shrimp mussels quartered sea scallops and exceptionally tender calamari rings all blessed with a perky lemon vinaigrette at entree time spring for the 16 lamb chops seven tiny lollipop chops with long white bones that want to be picked up the tasty juicy chops best evers in my book arrived with a small clump of arugula salad and a balsamic dipping sauce one evening the special was roast chicken over mashed potatoes and spinach 15 it was an exemplary bird with crisp herb flecked skin and juicy meat the large generous panini grill pressed sandwiches with about a half dozen savory fillings were also worthy possibilities included tempting combinations like goat cheese and caponata and chicken arugula tomato and asiago cheese do n't miss the spaghettini in a fresh tasting tomato sauce it was a classic done well convince a friend to order the tiny veal meatballs in a lush tomato veal sauce the flavorful marble size morsels were satisfying by themselves augmented only by diane 's great bread other pastas that should not be overlooked are the lasagne with spinach shiitakes goat cheese and tomato basil sauce and the lasagne bolognese with its crunchy top layer just as the meal began with the same bread basket as next door addictive cheese crisps foccacia and slices of chewy bread it ended with the dessert list from trattoria diane all 8 my old favorite the three berry pie with vanilla ice cream was on it as were new favorites the silken panna cotta the chocolate mousse cake and various fruit tarts i 'm often asked where do you eat when you go out on your own time
