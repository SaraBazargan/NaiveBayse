 it 's the 11th day of the lunar new year festival in china the money god has been welcomed back to earth with firecrackers children ride their new bicycles on the roads and back alleyways of beijing the summer palace is seeing the last of its holiday visitors and all seems right with the world that is china in the northwestern corner of the capital city in a neighborhood that boasts two of china 's top universities beijing and qinghua streets once walked by the greatest intellectuals and revolutionaries in modern chinese history are now home to information technology moguls skyscrapers loom large luxury apartments sell for 2000 a square meter and businessmen send their children to school in well waxed coal black audi a6 's the head of china 's most popular and successful english institute the new oriental school yu minhong can barely keep up with the ranks of students wrangling to secure space in his classes entry into the world trade organization has given china new and much deserved confidence good english skills are the ticket to a prosperous life talent need no longer make its way abroad to find success there is a confidence in individual ability a sense of promise hope and freedom unprecedented in post 1949 chinese life there is much to be thankful for in this new year of the horse there is also much that should not be forgotten as president bush addressed students at qinghua university in beijing on the 30th anniversary of richard m nixon 's momentous trip to china where was the mention of the six qinghua graduate students recently sentenced in southern china 's xiangzhou district court in zhuhai city for utilizing an evil cult to sabotage legal enforcement all are practitioners of falun gong the outlawed meditation movement that numbers its followers in the tens of thousands they had been writing articles about the persecution of falun gong members a confident president jiang zemin claims that these young men and women were arrested for breaking chinese law not for their religious beliefs or for publishing their articles it was a slippery answer to a complex and painful question what exactly does freedom of expression mean as chinese citizens around the country gathered before their tv screens to hear mr bush 's speech we should recall that not far south of the qinghua campus one of china 's most prominent dissidents the literary critic liu xiaobo has been calling for the reform of china 's news media for years now his appeals have not always fallen on deaf ears they brought him three years of re education in a labor camp such a sentence requires no trial one of the many quirks in a legal system responsible for a fifth of the world 's population as liu xiaobo noted in a recent public letter the fact that china can view a press conference or a presidential address on television does not prove that journalism is free and open president jiang 's turns on the dance floor with laura bush and condoleezza rice at thursday evening 's presidential dinner and his stage rocking rendition of o sole mio do not a democratic president make appearances are deceiving president bush 's visit to qinghua came before classes resumed to a campus of closed doors and pulled curtains each audience member each representative student was carefully chosen each question censored a performance orchestrated for an audience whose vision has become blurred by the skyscrapers the sitcoms preaching the power of love and money the european cars the mcdonalds the starbucks the louis vuitton bags and sparkling chanel fragrance counters found in upscale shops around the country the united states is at yet another crossroads in its relationship with china thirty years have passed china is experiencing unprecedented prosperity as the united states struggles through a period of painful contemplation there is much to be remembered more to be learned as globalization brings us closer together and as technology beams the smiling faces of two presidents around the world we should not forget to ask the questions that still need to be asked when will the media in china be privatized when will newspaper editors in china be free to publish articles on topics of their choice when will the ruthless surveillance of writers stop including that of wang yiliang and liao yiwu who have spent years in labor camps and prison cells for daring to write when will china 's people be able to savor and explore the fullest meaning of that phrase freedom of expression a chinese government official claimed before mr bush 's visit that several political prisoners would be released after the visit is this part of the hype that usually surrounds the visits of foreign dignitaries yesterday as the american president 's trip wound down several dozen christians were arrested in beijing for gathering together in public will jailed dissidents like xu wenli the former chairman of the china democratic party who has spent 15 of the last 20 years in jail finally see the light of day we must not become too enthralled with an image of a modern prosperous china americans also must not get lost in the rhetoric of war on terrorism to such a degree that chinese cooperation on that front will blind us to reality for its own sake the united states needs to look more closely at its china policy and at how this policy is being presented by chinese news outlets and viewed by the chinese people in a country without media freedom american democracy and power with some spin can easily be presented as a hateful american hegemony freedom of expression in china is very much in america 's interests in part because without it the government will be able to shape decisively what the chinese people think of the united states on a perfectly beautiful sunny day in september of 2001 the world was reminded of the price paid for freedom who knew the sky was clear the markets were up the subways were packed with commuters on this day of the lunar new year with spring just around the corner beijing 's avenue of heavenly peace throngs with the last of holiday revelers the highways are crowded with evidence of new wealth customers at a starbucks in shanghai pay 3 for a caffe mocha and never feel the sting and there are writers in prison simply because they are writers printing a commentary piece like this could bring a death sentence in china the sun shone as president bush 's motorcade made its way through beijing 's burgeoning streets but looks can be deceiving bei ling a poet and research associate at harvard 's fairbank center for east asian research is director of the independent chinese pen center andrea huss currently in shanghai is a professor of chinese literature at wellesley college
