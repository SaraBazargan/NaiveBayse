 massacre at the palace the doomed royal dynasty of nepal by jonathan gregson 255 pages talk miramax books 2495 if jonathan gregson 's account of nepal 's turbulent history is to be believed the fate of that country 's monarchy may have been determined by a bowl of curd his book describes the 18th century legend surrounding prithvi narayan shah the first leader to rule nepal as a unified kingdom this king is said to have offered the curd to a hermit who consumed it and then to have been aghast when the hermit vomited it back at him but the hermit was actually a disguised deity named gorakhnath and because the king shied away from the regurgitated curd the deity put a curse on the royal family prithvi narayan shah was told that his family 's dynasty would endure for 10 generations and then come to an end cut to narayanhiti palace in kathmandu on june 1 2001 the 10th member of the shah family regime was about to come to a catastrophic end the heavily armed crown prince dipendra opened fire and mowed down the royal family killing his parents brother and sister among others dipendra shot himself as well and survived virtually brain dead for two days during which he was regarded as nepal 's new king nobody not even the most morbid of jacobean playwrights or greek tragedians mr gregwon writes could have invented a plot with so much self inflicted damage nor such a bizarre twist at the end curd aside what happened in massacre at the palace mr gregson can only speculate on the exact nature of dipendra 's grievance concurring with early reports that the killer 's thwarted desire to marry his sweetheart helped to unhinge him but mr gregson can explain why this mayhem shocking as it was for nepal may not have been altogether surprising his history of nepal 's royal machinations is filled with persistently bizarre eruptions of internecine violence the first half of this book provides an overview of nepal 's complex aristocracy unfortunately this account is not accompanied by a map genealogical chart or bibliography that might shed additional light on these matters but perhaps that is understandable mr gregson describes contrasts among tribes like limbus rais rajbansis dhimals bodos chepangs and kusundas and that is just on a single page he notes that it has been estimated that there are as many different languages and dialects spoken within nepal as in the whole of western europe and he explains the trickiness of nepal 's geographical position between india and china which prithvi narayan shah described as being like a yam between two boulders mr gregson illustrates the various s words that helped to sustain the shah monarchy in this remote setting succession the rules for choosing each king were strictly codified to the point where the sovereign on the book 's cover is king tribhuvan photographed as a 5 year old in royal robes sati a royal widow was expected to undergo this ritual cremation but she could be saved if her son ascended the throne and she had an obvious interest in advancing his cause smallpox nepalese royalty was much afflicted by this disease which wrought havoc with the family tree and superstition the king 's divinity was widely accepted by his people hence the reverence with which even the most vicious and ineffectual of monarchs was held by his subjects in this dry but extremely eventful early part of his account mr gregson also explores the intricate dealings between the monarchs and their government ministers who assumed the princely title rana from the name of a prominent family and often wielded more influence than the rulers they represented and he explains how nepal became increasingly exposed to outside influences that shaped its rulers tastes and heightened restlessness even if acquiring automobiles in this remote region once meant having rolls royces and cadillacs carried by porters over two mountain ranges to reach kathmandu by the time prince dipendra had been enrolled at eton and nicknamed dippy apparently as much for his dipsomania as for his name mr gregson suggests that the royal palace had become a suffocating environment for a young man with worldly ambitions and dipendra had shown early signs of instability in any case he liked weapons took drugs and had a habit of punching people 'as a joke which some etonians did not find so funny massacre at the palace presents this behavior as an echo of earlier royal black sheep like crown prince surendra who in the mid 19th century would order his subjects to jump down a well or ride a horse off a cliff just to see whether they would die regardless of whether such unattributed stories are authoritative or apocryphal mr gregson a journalist who grew up in calcutta and has written extensively about the himalayan region presents a coherent pattern of decline he suggests that the very outmoded and restrictive customs that long protected nepal 's monarchy have also been infantilizing and destructive as much for the country 's residents as for its rulers the post dipendra weakened shah dynasty now faces civil unrest and the influence of maoist insurgents not to mention the burden of having watched the country 's most revered royal traditions turn into tabloid fodder mr gregson provides an interesting thoughtful account without sinking to that level
