 the charles atlas of algae diatoms algae that are major components of plankton are proof that small is beautiful their silica shells called frustules are exquisitely ornamented symmetrical structures but a diatom is more than just a pretty face its frustule is a form of armor that can protect the diatoms from predators just how much protection the typical diatom frustule offers has been determined by scientists in germany who performed load tests on several species engineers perform these kinds of tests all the time putting thousands of pounds of pressure on an aircraft part say until it breaks the diatom tests were the same but since diatoms are on the order of 100 microns in diameter very tiny amounts of force were applied using a microscopic glass needle the researchers writing last month in the journal nature say the three species tested broke at forces ranging from about 100 to 700 micronewtons this is equivalent to a weight of about 150 to 1000 pounds per square inch not bad for a single celled organism the researchers also studied the shells using finite element analysis a technique that involves breaking down a structure into many elements whose behavior can be described by a set of equations that can be solved by a computer they found that most frustules have circumferential bands called girdles that help absorb stress and contribute to the shells remarkable strength ravages of the reef some of the effects of human settlement on nature are immediate and obvious an acre of forest cleared for agriculture for example is one less acre of habitat for other species but other effects are more subtle and long term a case in point is what has happened on the great barrier reef in australia where human settlement with its attendant land clearing cattle grazing mining and other activities has affected water quality agriculture industry and development lead to increased erosion and the eroded sediments can harm coral by blocking light and interfering with feeding the extent of the problem however has never been clear now australian researchers have shown that sediments in one part of the reef have increased 5 to 10 times since europeans began settling the area in the 1860 's the researchers describing their work last month in the journal nature used the coral itself in an area known as havannah reef as a marker for sediment concentration the sediments contain an element barium that is incorporated into coral skeletons as they grow since coral growth can be traced year by year as a tree 's age can be gauged by rings the researchers were able to track how the amount of sediment changed by analyzing barium concentration over the years from about 1750 to 1870 sediments reached the study area only rarely in huge floods along the burdekin river after 1870 however barium concentrations increased markedly within just a decade of europeans arrival in the region the researchers say there was already an effect on the reef waters one that continues to this day steps for the galapagos in january 2001 the delicate and historic ecosystem that is the galapagos islands had a close call a tanker ran aground near the islands and leaked most of its 240000 gallons of fuel oil although the damage was limited most of the oil evaporated and only a few animals died conservationists realized it could have been much worse hoping to avoid future disasters the ecuadorean government signed an agreement last weekend with wwf the conservation group formerly called the world wildlife fund and a local group to develop a renewable energy program for the archipelago the plan calls for cleaner motors for boats that frequent the islands and replacing diesel power plants with renewable sources like wind and solar power observatory correction march 14 2003 friday an illustration with the observatory column in science times on tuesday about the strength of the shells of diatoms single celled algae that are a major component of plankton depicted a different type of marine plankton it showed another single cell type a coccolithophorid which is spherical
