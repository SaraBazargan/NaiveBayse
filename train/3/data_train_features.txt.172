 the aftermath of monday 's six hour firefight in this palm studded village 50 miles west of baghdad was an encounter on tuesday with two different countries one was inhabited by an occupying army at war with unseen guerrillas who lay bombs on the roadside and shoot from the cover of citrus groves and stands of corn the other was inhabited by iraqi tribal families who were picking up the pieces of their shattered homes ahmad hassan whose two brothers were arrested by troops of the 82nd airborne division was showing relatives and many other visitors the pile of shrapnel that had shredded the masonry of his house like paperboard crushing a balustrade and setting fire to the upper floors where many of the 54 members of his extended family slept the night before the onslaught as he walked through the detritus of his home he denied that anyone in his family had had anything to do with the attack on an american convoy that sparked a counterattack by tanks helicopters bradley fighting vehicles and infantry we do n't know the people in the resistance said mr hassan whose house and those of his brothers bore the brunt of a combined armor and helicopter assault they come here in cars from all over the country and they chase the americans and shoot them whenever they see them as he spoke cousins were arriving from baghdad and other distant places because they had seen on arab satellite television news that their ancestral village had come under attack we came to see the work of the great liberating army one announced as dozens of tribal elders arranged themselves on plastic chairs in the courtyard to express their sympathy and discuss the sad state of affairs in postwar iraq on the other side of the cultural divide american soldiers in tanks and armored vehicles put up a heavy cordon around the village of qurtan on the edge of this euphrates river town a gunner on an m1 abrams tank shouted down to a reporter i advise you to stay away from our position we are attracting fire this is a very dangerous area as he spoke a mounted convoy of infantry roared up the road through the scatter of houses tucked under the palms after they passed an iraqi roadside soda vendor warned do n't follow that convoy because they are preparing an ambush against it the police chief in this town was assassinated this month for collaborating with american forces and a stubborn underground of iraqi fighters is engaged in a clandestine war to drive american forces from sunni muslim tribal lands that have proved most troublesome for the united states military peace and stability the things that the elders here say they want most seem a distant prospect but as a military spokesman in baghdad said tuesday the low intensity war here is not typical of what is happening in much of postwar iraq the vast majority of the country was calm peaceful and rebuilding lt col george krivo said at a news briefing nonetheless he added the attacks on american forces in recent days show that the complexity and sophistication of the attacks is greater than we have seen in the past colonel krivo said iraqi guerrillas seemed better coordinated and organized in planning their attacks and in general were expanding the range of weapons used from small arms and rocket propelled grenades to mortars and more sophisticated mines and explosives there is a level of expertise that is higher than the average attack in the past he said however we want to be careful not to draw conclusions about why that is so it could be that we are getting down to the more hard core elements of the former regime that are actually out now taking action themselves the ambush on monday began after 9 am when a guerrilla force with small arms and rocket propelled grenade launchers opened fire on a convoy of the 82nd airborne four soldiers were wounded one of whom later died the convoy returned fire and called in reinforcements iraqi witnesses said tuesday that the convoy had been pinned down for some time by the attacking force as reinforcements came colonel krivo said soldiers identified the houses where the attackers took shelter and ordered an attack on them the most heavily damaged houses were those of the hassan brothers who said tuesday that no one had returned fire from their homes all family members fled to the cover of a nearby date palm plantation leaving behind two brothers salih hassan and faisal khalil to watch over the homes both were arrested in a subsequent sweep which colonel krivo said netted 14 suspects during the operation the colonel said observation helicopters arrived to track two men seen escaping from the houses and during the pursuit he added the helicopters came under fire from as many as 20 iraqis a helicopter and an armored vehicle returned fire on another building where the two men had taken cover west of baghdad on monday night an american soldier was killed when his humvee overturned into a canal while responding to a report of a mortar attack at abu ghraib two soldiers were rescued from the canal but a third was still missing the military said early tuesday morning a soldier was slightly wounded after his convoy was attacked in a residential neighborhood in baghdad apparently by an explosive from another vehicle despite the violence which military officials say is concentrated in a few areas american officials announced a loosening of the curfew in the capital the curfew will now begin at midnight rather than 11 pm and will continue to run until 4 am a statement from the military cited recent improvements in security and the reduction of crime as the reason for the easing
