 richard york gallery 21 east 65th street manhattan through may 10 born in london in 1812 john william hill came to america as a boy and spent most of his life in west nyack ny while working as a draftsman for the new york state geological survey he discovered john ruskin whose writings deeply influenced the english pre raphaelites hill cared nothing for the pre raphaelites medievalist mythology but he took to heart ruskin 's admonition to work directly from nature and he became the founder of the now barely remembered american pre raphaelite movement this exhibition of works on paper from 1848 to 1876 includes many small landscape pencil drawings and watercolors skillfully made with meticulous delicacy longer views of mountains valleys and lakes tend to be conventionally picturesque for all its sunny luminosity there is a small brush fussiness in the large watercolor of a mill with two boys at the pond 's edge it makes one wish for the vigor of homer 's watercolors it is when he drew close to study things in detail that hill 's work comes alive two remarkable still life watercolors stand out from everything else in the show fruits vegetables and nuts are arranged on the ground with grass and weeds behind them the composition is flat footed as though the artist was less interested in making a nice picture than in testing the limits of his observational capabilities rendered with zillions of minuscule multicolored brushstrokes the objects under study assume a robust earthy palpability that one imagines henry david thoreau would have appreciated ken johnson
