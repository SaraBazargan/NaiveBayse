 fiat and its principal shareholder the agnelli family of italy joined with the french national utility today in a hostile bid for control of italy 's second largest utility montedison late today fiat and the utility electricite de france said that they had so far reached agreements for control of 5209 percent of montedison 's shares with a bid that values the company at 42 billion the alliance of the agnellis and the french utility at first took many investors in italy and france by surprise that the agnellis italy 's most powerful industrial clan would come to the rescue of a government owned french company seeking to gain a toehold in the lucrative italian energy market was unusual enough the move was all the more startling because it pitted fiat and the agnellis against the milan investment bank mediobanca once a faithful ally of the agnellis in the salotto buono or polite salon where the affairs of italian finance have discreetly been arranged for decades but investors soon recognized the logic in the alliance with electricite de france the agnelli family is no no stranger to france and in recent years has extended its large holdings north of the alps acquiring such diverse assets as the foundry and machinery units of the french automaker renault and a controlling stake in the french resort company club mediterranee if 10 years ago fiat represented 80 percent of the agnelli holdings today the figure is about 57 percent and much of the increase elsewhere has been through investment in france nor was the decision to move against mediobanca on closer inspection so startling enrico cuccia mediobanca 's former chairman had forged the secretive investment bank into a kind of club of northern italy 's powerful industrialists after mediobanca was founded in 1946 and mr cuccia then a dynamic young banker was put in charge in its glory days mediobanca was a kind of house bank of the agnellis and of italy in 1986 for instance mr cuccia helped the agnellis get rid of the libyan leader muammar el qaddafi as shareholder in fiat by buying back shares of the fiat automotive empire worth over 3 billion but mr cuccia died last year at 92 and though by then he was only the honorary chairman of mediobanca his departure from the scene appeared to signal the end of the 1990 's period of upheaval in italian business and finance indeed there appeared to be a certain symbolism in the emergence of montedison as the bone of contention between the agnellis and mediobanca in 1993 it was mr cuccia and mediobanca who fulfilled their traditional role in italian business and lined up italian industrial and financial investors to take montedison under their wing by exchanging debt for equity after montedison 's former majority shareholder the ferruzzi group collapsed under a mountain of debt and its creator and chairman raul gardini committed suicide but the disappearance of groups like ferruzzi and industrialists like mr gardini in the financial and industrial upheaval that swept italy in the 1990 's only served to cement the position of fiat and the agnellis at the center of italian business moreover as italy was forced to face the challenges of globalization fiat extended its international reach in 1998 the agnellis picked paolo fresco to be chairman of fiat he was an executive at general electric for almost four decades and became vice chairman under john f welch jr and last year fiat brought in general motors as a major shareholder by contrast mediobanca has struggled to keep its influence from dwindling whittled down by the invasion into italy of big wall street investment banks in the end it was montedison that prompted fiat and mediobanca to cross swords earlier this year gianni agnelli the family patriarch and honorary chairman of fiat suggested that he had little faith in mediobanca and the financial investors that controlled montedison to develop a long term industrial plan such a plan appeared all the more crucial mr agnelli believed given the deregulation of the italian energy market in which montedison is the second biggest player after the former national monopoly enel and the most efficient then in mid may electricite de france announced that it had acquired a 397 percent stake in montedison which it soon increased to 20 percent with an apparent eye to using montedison as a vehicle for entering the italian energy market itay objecting to electricite de france 's continued ownership by france and french sluggishness in opening the french energy market where electricite de france has a 90 percent grip capped electricite de france 's voting rights in montedison fiat and electricite de france created a consortium called italenergia to absorb the montedison holding company and its power generating unit edison italenergia is 40 percent owned by fiat and 18 percent by electricite de france with the remainder in the hands of financial partners it has offered 282 euros about 241 a share for the remaining stock in montedison valuing montedison at about 42 billion fiat generates power for its factories and occasionally sells surplus electricity onto the national energy grid its expansion into power generating while leaving the management to electricite de france fits well with the concept of conglomerate that mr fresco learned at the feet of jack welch utilities are always seen as cash cows that can enhance cash flow while cars rely on the state of the economy noted gareth williams an analyst with the actinvest group
