 the peabody conservatory in baltimore is one of the country 's best music schools and like many institutions devoted to preparing musicians for professional careers it periodically thrusts them into the public spotlight on wednesday evening the peabody symphony orchestra led by its music director hajime teri murai presented a demanding program that focused on two of the school 's graduates who have done well michael nathaniel hersch a composer who at 29 has attracted considerable attention in the last few years and the guitarist manuel barrueco who studied at peabody in the 1970 's and is now a member of the school 's faculty mr hersch 's vivid dark textured ashes of memory 1999 was the program 's principal attraction the work was composed for the pittsburgh symphony orchestra which performed it at carnegie hall in march but because the pittsburgh concert unaccountably offered only the second of the work 's two movements the peabody performance was the new york premiere of the entire 20 minute score and one thing this complete reading showed was how little sense it made to play only the finale since most of the central episodes in that movement are derived from materials introduced in the first like other works of mr hersch 's that have been heard in new york ashes of memory speaks in a language whose gestures and broader structures are rooted in romanticism but that language has an edge and an inventiveness that keep the music from seeming like warmed over brahms it also makes hefty demands on every section of the orchestra and there were times when the peabody students momentarily faltered still they conveyed the almost visual imagery of mr hersch 's gradually unfolding themes with a clarity and directness that served the music well mr barrueco 's contribution was a precise smoothly flowing account of rodrigo 's popular concierto de aranjuez for which mr murai and his players provided a properly supple support the orchestra also offered a robust sometimes clattery performance of verdi 's forza del destino overture and a vigorous if at times rough hewn reading of bartok 's miraculous mandarin suite
