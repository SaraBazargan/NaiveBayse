 to the editor re why chain stores are n't the big bad wolf on the contrary june 3 in which daniel akst justified shopping at big discount stores by saying they help the working poor by offering jobs and low prices large chain stores with their high staff turnover can never provide the service of small local specialty stores although mr akst says local stores never lived up to their image instead providing a unique combination of high prices and poor service sustained only by the local monopolies they enjoyed before the advent of the chains i dare say that anyone who has ever looked for help in a large chain store or a big box bookstore will take exception mr akst also says chain stores force other stores to lower their prices too implying more competition but smaller stores which buy products in dozens ca n't possibly compete with chains which buy by the containerload and the column ignores the role that small neighborhood stores fill for older shoppers who using public transportation or traveling on foot are not likely to be impressed by acres of parking spaces at the mall small businesses are and always have been the lifeblood of their communities they support the little league teams the school plays the junior league fund raisers and so on service convenience product knowledge special ordering knowing their customers and their families by name remembering their sizes if mr akst can find all that in a chain store then by all means that 's where he should shop my guess is that he wo n't find it eric nussbaum scarsdale ny june 4
