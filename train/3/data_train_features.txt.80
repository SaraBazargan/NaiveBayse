 elizabeth schneider is the neil armstrong of cookbook authors more earthbound recipe writers spend their time stewing over how to convert predictable carrots and ginger into soup and then how to describe the result in the usual cliches she sets her sights on the universe beyond the supermarket produce aisle and lets the ingredients speak for themselves her last book uncommon fruits and vegetables morrow 1986 was at least a decade ahead of its time there had never been a single resource that so thoroughly and reliably explained how to buy incoming exotica like jerusalem artichokes cardoons and lemon grass and what to do with them once you got them home its brilliance lay in demystifying the new cornucopia evolving in the united states as waves of latino and asian immigration changed the way americans new and old cooked and ate now ms schneider goes galaxies farther with vegetables from amaranth to zucchini morrow 60 777 pages she revisits many items in the original book but also includes produce i have never seen not even in other books like arrowheads oca banana buds and perilla and she proves she is several steps ahead with vegetables only beginning to turn up in supermarkets like broccolini a k a asparation the ideal marriage of asparagus and broccoli in every case ms schneider 's research is impeccable and often awe inspiring unfortunately it comes in a very frustrating package i knew the reading would not be easy when i saw not one but three introductory quotes before the contents page from shakespeare jefferson and a 17th century italian a steel willed editor would have helped the 134 chapters each includes a color photograph of the raw vegetable a list of alternative names a description of basic uses and advice on how to select store and prepare the produce ms schneider then offers a few full blown recipes and variations and ends with a long selection of descriptive recipes from chefs and other cookbook authors pros propose is the corny heading it all makes for a brilliant but maddening book as with marian morash 's indispensable victory garden cookbook the emphasis is more on facts and functionality than on dazzling flavor combinations but unlike that handbook this one does not bother with garden variety produce the only potatoes are specialty types like fingerlings there is no chapter on tomatoes only tomatillos what ms schneider does with all this is mostly straightforward lacking the leaps of imagination her pros might take like using coconut milk instead of stock in a winter squash soup kale stewed in the oven with potatoes and olives was particularly dull but occasionally her recipes are startlingly good limas creamed with horseradish were an irresistible upgrade of a legume with personality problems bok choy braised with salt and oil browned in butter and then topped with grated comte was the best use of that normally tough and chewy vegetable i have ever made and beets baked in little foil packets with star anise could not be simpler or more unusual in the age of the internet with all flash all the time vegetables is seriously hurt by its design expanses of pale gray type almost fade to white making it a struggle to pick out the key sections on selection and preparation the pros propose segments are particularly dense at least for a cook looking for ideas in a hurry graphically uncommon fruits was no walk in the garden either and over the years i 'm sure i will become just as adept at deciphering the sequel and i will certainly be using vegetables for as long as i can lift a knife in 1986 bok choy was an oddity that required a trip to chinatown now it 's a staple even in the greek market in my underserved neighborhood there may come a day when amaranth is right alongside it and i 'll be ready thanks to elizabeth schneider 's giant leap broccolini with asian orange dressing adapted from vegetables from amaranth to zucchini by elizabeth schneider morrow 60 time 10 minutes 3 tablespoons corn oil 1 tablespoon asian dark sesame oil 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon shoyu japanese soy sauce 1 2 teaspoon grated orange zest 2 tablespoons orange juice 1 very small white onion peeled and cut into small chunks 2 bunches broccolini also known as asparation 1 in a blender or small food processor combine corn and sesame oils vinegar shoyu zest and juice whirl to blend add onion and whiz until smooth continue processing until fairly pale and creamy but not until pureed 2 rinse broccolini and trim if needed set on a steamer rack over boiling water cover and steam until crunchy tender 3 to 5 minutes depending on size 3 arrange stalks in serving dish spoon neat bands of dressing over all serve hot or warm yield 4 to 6 first course or side dish servings
