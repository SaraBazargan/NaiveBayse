 the town of hempstead 's housing code piece by piece to a new nassau feb 16 is toothless the only way to put pressure on the homeowner with an illegal apartment is for the town of hempstead to mail a formal questionnaire the questionnaire would require the homeowner to answer yes or no to having an illegal rental under penalty of perjury and a hefty fine the town of hempstead has an official population of 760000 and a hidden population of 20 percent or 150000 people who are illegal renters these people vote on the school budget increase the school population burden the facilities of the county the town and special districts and clog the roads with overnight parking but pay no property or school taxes since this problem has been ignored for too long by our elected officials evicting 150000 people into the street without affordable housing available is irresponsible the only solution is to replace the present school and property taxes with an equitable residency income tax and let all the people pick up the cost not just the homeowners joseph m sardone franklin square
