 two members of the nassau county legislature jeffrey toback and michael zapson say there 's something rotten in oceanside but neither oceanside residents nor the town of hempstead nor the state department of environmental conservation can agree on what it is or where it 's coming from on june 21 mr toback and mr zapson joined a group of about 40 people at a protest the third last month in front of the waste transfer station owned by the town of hempstead on long beach road in oceanside next to the former oceanside landfill the protesters contend that strong odors have been coming from the station in the last few months some said the place smelled like manure others compared the odor to garbage or rotten eggs the transfer station accepts mostly yard waste like grass clippings and branches brought in by landscapers and yard services and some metal goods like refrigerators the waste and metal are then shipped out in trucks to landfills or recycling plants the transfer station has been operating since 1988 the town denied that there was a problem in a written statement issued last month a town spokesman mike deery took issue with the two legislators in a flier announcing the june 21 protest mr toback and mr zapson had said let 's close the town of hempstead 's oceanside dump facility once and for all mr deery said that by using the word dump people would be misled into thinking that the landfill was still open as he put it in a written statement released last month today 's call for the closing of the oceanside dump is a cynical and shameless attempt by lawmakers seeking re election to mislead residents as to the current status of this facility in fact the oceanside dump has been closed since 1989 mr toback and mr zapson both democrats face republican challengers in november mr deery said later in a telephone interview that the town had received only one formal complaint about odors from the station he added that state department of environmental conservation which issues the permit for the station and inspects it had not cited any violations and had continued to issue it a clean bill of health in its reports he said that the source of the odors might be from recycling companies in oceanside or from a county sewage pumping station a department of environmental conservation spokesman michael fraser agreed that any of these could generate odors and said that the department had stepped up its inspections of all of them to four times a week representatives from the two recycling companies nearest the transfer station and from the county sewage pumping station denied that the smells were coming from them mr zapson whose district includes about 80 percent of oceanside stood pat we believe this is where they 're coming from he said in front of the transfer station at the protest last month i mean you just have to stand here to smell it each time a landscaper 's truck drove through the crowd there was a noticeable manure type smell from the vehicle mr toback a democrat whose district includes 20 percent of oceanside cited two potential odor sources liquid dripping from the landscapers trucks and the storage of yard waste inside the station overnight jeff frank the director of the nature lyceum which teaches organic gardening in westhampton said that the record breaking rainfall this spring might be a factor the rain has made for lush growth which means more grass clippings and when grass clippings start to decompose he said the odor can resemble manure the issue of overnight storage at the transfer station has been a source of some confusion until late last month the department of environmental conservation had maintained that there should be no overnight storage at the transfer station citing a stipulation in its permit that says at the close of business each day all tipping pads shall be free of all debris and swept clean but when the permit was last renewed in december 2002 the department had added a provision that allows up to 2500 tons of waste to be stockpiled a condition the town interpreted to mean that it could be stored overnight on june 27 the department reversed its official position agreeing with the town that overnight storage had been permitted since last december mr fraser the dec spokesman said that the provision was added to give the town more flexibility ideally there would be nothing staying overnight he said but we realize that due to the volume that comes in during their heavy times that some overnight storage is necessary david levy counsel to the town of hempstead said that it was the town 's policy not to store waste overnight and it did so only when a landscaper arrived late in the day after the last truck had left for a landfill or recycling station mr fraser said that recent department records show that the station has stored as little as 10 tons and as much as 400 tons in the last few months he could not say if there were any nights when nothing was stored mr toback the legislator said the fact that no one had complained about this under the old permit and we are complaining about it under the new permit seems to indicate that storage is the problem and they 're in violation of the permit by allowing the odors out meanwhile there seems to be no consensus about the extent of the problem or if there is a problem at all among people who live in oceanside nancy magaddino 65 who lives in oceanside cove a co op apartment complex at daly boulevard and long beach road near the transfer station said i ca n't keep my windows open and i ca n't breathe it stinks to high heaven les and judy gardonyi said they could smell the transfer station at their house about half a mile away you step out in the morning and you get a huge whiff mr gardonyi said at the june 21 protest but marc karp another oceanside resident came to the protest to dissent calling the gathering a political ploy mr karp was the vice president of close the committee to learn organize and save the environment which successfully fought to close the landfill in the 1980 's i 'm objecting to the fact that they 're creating fears and anxiety in the community which are unwarranted he said of the protesters michael raphan a lawyer who lives and practices in oceanside was the president of close he said that he had not noticed any smells i do n't want people in oceanside to begin to think that the landfill is open he said and the garbage dump is being used again
