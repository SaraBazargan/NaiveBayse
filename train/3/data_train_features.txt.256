 gray davis the embattled governor of california is getting an unwanted lesson in speech pathology namely how difficult it is to say you 're sorry with your foot in your mouth on saturday during a union rally governor davis took a swipe at the chunky austrian accent of his republican rival the actor arnold schwarzenegger you should n't be governor unless you can pronounce the name of the state mr davis wisecracked to a supporter according to a report in the sacramento bee the comment has caused a stir in a state that is home to nine million immigrants many of whom support mr davis a democrat the governor asked to explain himself sunday after the mexican independence day parade in east los angeles said i was just joking around with someone in the crowd still he has not issued an apology and his wife sharon said on television this morning that mr schwarzenegger should just take it as a joke and move on mr schwarzenegger was also supposed to attend the parade as grand marshal but the invitation was withdrawn at the request of some prominent democrats who believe he is hostile toward illegal immigrants speaking instead at a youth awards ceremony in a latino neighborhood on sunday mr schwarzenegger turned mr davis 's remarks to his advantage he does n't like the way i say the word california because i say cal ee fornia rather than cal a fornia mr schwarzenegger said but there 's many other words that he does n't like lost jobs he does n't like that word he does n't like blackout he does n't like energy crisis and he definitely does n't like recall so those are words that he just does n't like you know actually mr schwarzenegger enunciates the word california more closely to its true spanish root than does mr davis a native new yorker who uses the anglicized version while mr schwarzenegger did not call for an apology the state republicans did gray davis owes every californian an apology for his insensitive remarks about immigrants who come to this country speaking with an accent said mario rodriguez vice chairman of the california republican party it is preposterous to suggest that nonnative english speakers and those with accents are unqualified to lead our state lt gov cruz bustamante the grandson of mexican immigrants felt it was better today to say nothing than defend mr davis the bilingual mr bustamante who says he will vote no on the recall and yes for himself as the replacement governor has in recent appearances spoken like a man who wants mr davis 's job i need your vote for governor mr bustamante told a hometown crowd in fresno on sunday he has also at times criticized the governor 's leadership abilities for the record mr bustamante pronounces it cal a fornia when speaking english and cal ee for nee a when speaking spanish
