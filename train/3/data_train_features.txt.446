bomb mr padilla an obscure maintenance man and hotel worker was largely forgotten by everyone but his family here why and how he ended up in a navy brig accused of conspiring with the world 's most notorious terrorist remains a mystery mr padilla 's path seems to have little in common with that of john walker lindh the american who grew up in a liberal affluent family in the san francisco bay area before traveling to pakistan and afghanistan and ultimately joining the taliban mr padilla came from a poor puerto rican family after his conversion his mother estela ortega lebron told friends that her son had joined a cult mr padilla now 31 served time in a juvenile detention center in illinois and had apparently jumped bail when he arrived in florida to take jobs working at the hilton hotel in sunrise and setting up tables at the holiday inn in plantation on oct 8 1991 just before his 21st birthday his black toyota was nearly hit by another car at an intersection in sunrise mr padilla shouted at the other driver and waved a silver revolver when the other driver trying to see his license plates followed him into a gas station mr padilla fired a shot missing the other car and

qureshi a muslim from pakistan who was a founder of the school of islamic studies in sunrise he said mr padilla came to him for advice one day he told me he wanted to convert and accept islam mr qureshi said i said the company policy was not to discuss religion i told him he could go to the yellow pages or telephone book to find information on his own he went to a local mosque and converted mr qureshi said it does not take a long time about 10 seconds and he was given a muslim name randomly picked it was ibrahim ms stultz also converted taking the name marwah she continued to work at the taco bell until 1994 but mr padilla left in mid 1993 mr qureshi said and that was my last contact with him i was shocked to see his picture on tv mr qureshi said mr padilla spent two years working at the coral ridge golf course and in 1994 legally changed his name to ibrahim on jan 2 1996 he and ms stultz married he took classes on the koran at the darul uloom islamic institute which shares an old winn dixie grocery store building in pembroke pines fla with two christian churches a photograph taken four or five years ago shows mr padilla wearing a multicolored head scarf known as a kaffiyeh with his arm around the shoulders of another student in the group the teacher shown in the photograph mufti hassan now 75 said he could not remember the names of any of the students because he was only filling in but he did remember the kaffiyeh he said because it was so rare to see anyone wearing one in this country during the mid 1990 's mr padilla was also attending the masjid al iman mosque in sunrise which provides muslim religious volunteers to the county jail sheriff ken jenne of broward county told reporters this week that mr padilla had registered as a roman catholic when he entered

others would give the foundation 2 1 2 percent of their earnings at other times they gave what they could when the foundation 's assets were frozen he said he was very upset i suggested that the president send his own people to disperse the fund to widows and orphans mr qureshi said nonetheless 9 11 forces all of us to think about it where was this money going to the poor or to hamas or hezbollah mr padilla 's own politics in his years after converting and even his residence are unclear when his wife filed for divorce in january 2001 she said that they had separated in december 1998
