 as he walked to meet tiger woods at the driving range this morning butch harmon was asked if woods expects to contend every week harmon laughed at the question tiger does n't expect to contend every week said harmon woods 's only coach since turning professional contending is n't good enough we expect to win every time we tee it up now you have to be realistic winning is not always going to happen but he 's driven to be the best with him it 's not about money it 's not about fame it 's about being the best there ever was that 's the challenge and everything he does is directed toward that goal to do it you need longevity and only time will tell but winning is always the focus the focus will remain on woods beginning thursday when he attempts to win his sixth consecutive start on the pga tour at the att pebble beach national pro am only two players in tour history have won more than five consecutive starts byron nelson who won an incredible 11 consecutive starts in 1945 and ben hogan who won six consecutive starts in 1948 woods has played down his current streak because it has stretched over two calendar years and because he did not win the johnnie walker classic last november in taiwan nor the williams world challenge in january those were not official tour events however so until woods loses on tour he can expect scenes like today when more than 50 reporters surrounded him following his practice round at pebble beach the streak may not motivate woods but winning does i do n't know what competitor likes finishing second said woods who will be playing for the first time in three weeks since winning the mercedes championships last month in hawaii my ultimate goal is to win and anything short of that i 'm always going to be disappointed born and reared in california woods would love to win at pebble beach one of the world 's most picturesque courses he came close to winning the tournament in 1997 when he tied for second place with david duval one stroke behind the winner mark o'meara woods made a dramatic weekend charge in '97 shooting a third round 63 and a final round 64 which nearly erased a seven stroke deficit on sunday needing an eagle on pebble beach 's famous par 5 18th hole to tie o'meara woods reached the green with a 3 wood from 267 yards on his second shot but he just missed a 35 foot putt that would have tied him for first that experience gives woods even more confidence heading into this weekend as if he needs more confidence his victory in hawaii was a classic ernie els played superbly in hawaii and against anyone else it probably would have been enough to win but it was n't enough to beat woods both els and woods made eagle at no 18 to force a playoff but woods ended the duel two holes later making a phenomenal 40 foot putt for birdie els left wondering what else he could have done woods left with another dramatic victory can woods top last year when he won nine times worldwide and eight times on the tour harmon would not rule it out i think you 're going to see him get a lot better this year harmon said he hit 71 percent of his fairways last year and we 'd like to get that up to 75 his bad shots are going to get less erratic his swing is continuing to improve he may not win 10 times but he 's going to play better golf the weather is usually a factor at pebble beach where strong winds and rain are commonplace but woods dealt with strong winds effectively in hawaii using a low trajectory 3 wood shot off the tee that he has worked on during the past year if the wind blows this week woods will actually welcome it it separates a lot of players said woods referring to the wind you have to focus a little bit harder grind it out some of the guys do n't want to be out there woods will play thursday at poppy hills one of three courses on which the tournament is held on friday woods moves to spyglass hill before playing both saturday and sunday at pebble beach jerry chang who played with woods on stanford 's golf team will be his amateur playing partner woods was supposed to play with michael jordan who pulled out after accepting his new front office position with the washington wizards he 's got a job said woods laughing about jordan he ca n't get off work even though he 's the boss but on the golf course woods believes he is the boss and he hoped to drive home that point again this week winning at pebble would mean a lot said woods i have played great weekend rounds here i just need to get off to a better start
