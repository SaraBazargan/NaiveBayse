 when it comes to polo or more precisely polo ralph lauren 's commercial sense has long outpaced the united states polo association 's from shirts to sheets to cologne polo is a near ubiquitous global brand and lauren perpetually relaxed looking and silver haired epitomizes elegant poloesque style a galling fact of life for the association unlike polo the association is engaged in the actual playing of polo as it has been since 1890 but lauren trademarked polo in 1967 in the 1960 's when ralph lauren got started everybody was playing polo and not interested in sports marketing merle jenkins the president of uspa properties said he said the association received 22 million in royalties last year from its licensing business of course polo and polo are associated with wealth or at least the impression of it lauren 's polo goods play off the cachet of riders atop horses galloping during seven minute periods on a 160 foot by 300 foot field the average polo player is a 40 year old man who earns 184000 a year and has a net worth of nearly 1 million according to the polo association with its 300 clubs and 3500 active members the association dearly wants to be like ralph and capitalize on being the true representative of polo not polo yet it says that the corporate ralph called polo ralph lauren has wielded a mighty mallet to keep the association from licensing a two horseman logo or really anything too polo y because it is too close to polo 's one horseman logo the latest chukker in their legal match part of a saga that is nearly 20 years old began last week when the polo association sued polo ralph lauren usa holdings in federal court in manhattan alleging that it maliciously acted to destroy the sports merchandising program of the us polo association by writing letters that intimidated retailers with trademark infringement lawsuits if they sold the association 's goods the lawsuit follows by 11 months polo 's still unresolved federal suit against the association for infringing on its rights by using the word polo and a player on a horse its dispute comes down to this odd notion polo does not wish the polo association to use the word polo alone to sell its goods the association believes that to be a straitjacket on its marketing we 're not saying polo ralph lauren should n't do what it does said jerry ferguson a lawyer for the association but we have a legitimate interest in the name polo les fagen a polo lawyer said a 1984 federal decree in an earlier lawsuit ordered that the association stay away from polo ralph lauren 's logos stay away from the horseman stay away from the name polo in trying to settle a lawsuit in the 1990 's the association said it presented all possible uses of its name logos and trademarks to polo for approval one that it approved the association says was the two horsemen upon that approval investments were made by the association and its licensees to make goods with the mallet swinging horsemen which is distinguished by one man and one horse from polo 's logo but fagen said polo never gave final approval earlier this year as they tried to settle last year 's lawsuit polo ralph lauren said the two horsemen infringed on its rights they say they did n't approve it even after approving it ferguson said when they changed their mind it devastated our business polo ralph lauren has told the association that it is ok to use some logos that say us polo association but not others that say the same thing because the polo is too prominent they have a name us polo association and if they can use it without confusing consumers they can do it fagen said if the association loses the lawsuit it may have to sell goods with a trademark horse logo we thought of becoming the us horse hockey association ferguson said but we do n't think the members would like it
