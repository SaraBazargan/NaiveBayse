 they are always surprised and they are always sorry when a boxer is carried from the ring with his brain in chaos it was n't supposed to be this way say the people who are making money from the carnage now they are doing it at museums what is next classrooms public squares churches the latest tragedy has taken place at the intrepid sea air space museum a retired aircraft carrier docked on the west side of manhattan on tuesday a warm and lovely evening 2438 paying customers or rather witnesses watched beethavean scottland of maryland age 26 lose consciousness during a bout with george jones as of last night scottland was fighting for his life as bravely as he had fought for his livelihood but he was listed in very critical condition at bellevue hospital it is not at all demeaning to scottland to say that he was damaged for the amusement of paying customers while doing something he wanted and probably loved to do other sports pursue a goal or a home run or a touchdown and injuries happen along the way his sport pursues temporary unconsciousness a minideath that then subsides if everybody is lucky that night this fight happened to be nationally televised on espn2 but hbo is the major player in this grisly business these networks do not distinguish between boxing and other events they carry sports are sports they say and they can not stage the matches in studios they need sites the flashier the better boxing used to be the product of smoky halls and was occasionally permitted into the major stadiums and arenas now it has become the province of the glitzy gambling dens a boxer died at one of donald trump 's casinos two years ago and the donald quite candidly admitted to a certain amount of queasiness at the spectacle of boxing which he could personally avoid by not attending anymore but in this age of dot com riches and urban rejuvenation and disposable income boxing commands other sites the lovely new stadium in coney island keyspan park will be used for boxing next saturday apparently 38 minor league baseball games will not generate enough revenue one of these nights the public utility and the brooklyn cyclones and the city that spent 39 million to build the stadium might be associated with death or brain damage do they want this there is also boxing at the hammerstein ballroom at the manhattan center where rock groups normally turn up the amps boxers will attempt to turn out each other 's lights perhaps permanently and the world 's most famous arena as madison square garden is called has returned to being an enabler of brain bashing after a period of disengagement as a longtime advocate of the abolition of boxing i do n't guess there is much difference between one abattoir and another but i confess to being outraged that the latest horror took place on the intrepid this vessel helped defend the united states during three wars from 1943 to 1974 and later served in space missions and cold war maneuvers as laura lee of the new york times noted yesterday the ship has survived seven bomb attacks five kamikaze strikes and one torpedo hit it was also used for boxing matches between sailors or fighters brought in to entertain the troops now the obscenity is that schoolchildren and tour groups go to the intrepid to marvel at the sacrifices and skills of people who served in a noble cause boxers are no less admirable than military people they undoubtedly bring the same hungers the same bravery the same hopes and fears but the cause is different to make a few bucks the intrepid was leased out for a boxing spectacle while people were dining and drinking in the pleasure spots of manhattan on a gorgeous summer evening paying customers collected on the deck of the intrepid the skyline was amazing and the sunset was amazing folks were going to get their money 's worth scottland took a ferocious pounding from jones early in their light heavyweight fight scottland had passed his physicals everything was in order or so they say the doctor on duty apparently expressed some concern when scottland was battered in the seventh round but then the boxer rebounded only to fall in the 10th round and then it was too late beethavean scottland lay in the ring and then they took him to the hospital straight from the deck of the intrepid the people entrusted to run this museum will say but it was n't supposed to happen this way people always say that after a boxer is carried out
