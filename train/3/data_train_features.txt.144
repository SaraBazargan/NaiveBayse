 like its makers the rake 's progress has no permanent home but in celebration of its 50th anniversary this paean by stravinsky to the classical era has returned to the birthplace of its principal librettist w h auden and to the source of its inspiration the rake begins with hogarth 's pictures of a profligate england auden 's words more were added by chester kallman set the stage together they put the english national opera 's new production in its natural element a company known for operas in english has this part of its work already done meanwhile the conception of the director annabel arden accepts the rootlessness and contradictions of this fascinating troubling opera for what they are pushing each element to its limits and leaving the audience to sort out the results stravinsky and auden two expatriates one russian the other english found themselves in postwar america remembering an italian viennese style of opera then dead for a century and a half this production follows them and period is ignored we are given new york policemen yankee sailors top hatted swells and rough trade gays nick shadow 's minions are british civil servants in bowler hats baba the turk 's sedan chair is a miniaturized sputnik she sings through a porthole the auction scene is swaddled in yellow police tape shadow 's bread making machine is a kind of atm tom rakewell 's dress flirts with 18th century fashion but his name engraved corporate style in granite suggests the pitfalls of the american dream as a subtheme hogarth and damon runyon function side by side and why not the rake 's progress was always tortured by conflicting premises it begins with high minded artificiality a conscious attempt to recreate an 18th century opera in which the orchestral effects and vocal formats refer to mozart but where most of the notes go to great lengths to avoid sounding anything like him ms arden highlights the artifice encouraging us to witness both the drama and the theatrical craft behind it much of the evening is played in front of the london coliseum 's fire curtain or a facsimile thereof shadow cues his continuo harpsichordist who sometimes leaves the pit himself and becomes a player onstage chorus members handling viciously difficult music with great style periodically retreat to the boxes and become an audience within an audience auden 's texts acknowledge the conventions of da ponte period librettos but work hard to mock them and rise above them given the nature of operatic singing the acoustics of opera theaters and stravinsky 's weird and jumpy application of syllable to musical rhythm much of auden 's cleverness is more effectively read at home than heard in performance it may be too good for opera altogether indeed the rake is a thoughtful work by intelligent men and one can argue that too much thought never did opera much good the innocence and directness of the evening 's lovers tom rakewell and anne trulove must play against the soft shoe routines of shadow and company and all the allusions to opera history and 1950 's new york ms arden sends the lovers on their way with an intensity and directness that peers through the surrounding sophistication on thursday she had an excellent pair in barry banks and lisa milne a tenor and a soprano with finished voices good diction and a touching belief in what they were doing the rake invites us to admire its elegance from a distance and yet lose ourselves in doomed love these two made a strong case for that possibility gidon saks who towers over mr banks makes much of nick shadow he sings beautifully and is light of foot exhibiting both the devil 's charm and his menace sally burgess as baba and rebecca de pont davies as mother goose are nicely decadent john graham hall sellem and gerard o'connor trulove give strong performances vladimir jurowski 's conducting emphasizes the warmth and civility of stravinsky 's classical era transformations where others have stressed their brightness and hard angles the coliseum 's audience was cordial but not ecstatic
