 strange how potent ideas even cheap ones are and stranger still how seldom we encounter them in places like the theater or the novel we 're quite accustomed to their absence in politics when a century changes there is a power struggle between what we know and what we can imagine or just the habit of the familiar versus the ruptures of what has n't been fully or even partly tried subtle or violent we feel this push pull everywhere in politics technology art in all the conventions of caste and class that so shaped who we are or who we no longer wish to be just look back to the playwrights of the early 20th century to shaw and chekhov or to their elders ibsen and strindberg but we need n't look at only the designated greats we need more of the fiercely good less well known minds sensibilities even obsessions take harley granville barker the english playwright director and actor his 1907 play waste just had an an all too brief run in a theater for a new audience production at the american place theater in manhattan the characters in waste live and even die for ideas like church disestablishment and free education for all of britain 's children a woman 's right not to bear children the chasm between private misdeeds and public honor and for the question of whether absolute power corrupts absolutely or can permit compromises that actually benefit the powerless the combination of ideas and passionate theatricalism made waste potent enough to be censored by britain 's lord chamberlain in 1907 and languish unperformed until 1936 the ideas are just as potent now disestablishment some of you might ask it means the withdrawal of state funds from the church of england in our terms the separation of church and state my friends and i admitted we had n't thought of the word since a young black girl spelled antidisestablishmentarianism correctly on a national quiz show in the 1950 's a piece of trivia now but at the time we considered her another welcome proof of the controversial idea that blacks were as smart as whites waste takes us to a country estate where a lady who wants political power must settle for it by maneuvering through her husband where another lady more ambitious than her fiance plots his career behind his back and where a third lady who has left an overbearing husband must protect her reputation as though she were still a virginal maid and it takes us to the london homes where men meet making deals with shrewd anglican priests in high minded language or conducting crude blunt damage control sessions when a sexual liaison an abortion and a death jeopardize the plans of a prime minister and his cabinet what makes a play like this worth seeing is the bond between the past and the way we live or die now here is what happened then waste says here are some of the consequences think about what can and still does happen and it 's not only worth seeing it 's worth reading too playwrights like granville barker like shaw or chekhov strindberg or ibsen read as well as any of their novelist contemporaries they should be read silently or aloud and taught along with them which brings me to a potent and contemporary historical novel published just last year and set like waste in the first years of the century 1901 1909 it is city of light by lauren belfer the city is buffalo perhaps a comedown from london but turn of the century buffalo was a world contender a major force in agriculture and industry grain cattle steel and the country 's most important inland port thanks to the development of hydroelectric power at nearby niagara falls it pioneered the development of electricity and that placed it at the center of the nation 's first major environmental struggle how much water should be diverted from the falls to generate electricity what mattered more a miracle of nature or a miracle of technology and who would profit most from that technology if such a novel were to have a first person narrator a turn of the century writer a frank norris a dreiser an upton sinclair would make that narrator a man but ms belfer gives us louisa barrett headmistress of the intellectually serious socially responsible macaulay school for girls here is how she introduces herself to us to some i am a bluestocking a woman too intellectual to find a husband to others an old maid although i do not consider myself old and i am no maiden to still others i 've flirted with boston marriages i 've lived with other women they say but i never have not that way at least not the way they are implying nonetheless there is a certain benefit in being so considered wives do not fear their husbands spending time with me and overenergetic husbands look elsewhere for their dalliances yes people misjudge me they never guess the truth of my life and their assumptions lend me a freedom they would never credit thus has society given me room to maneuver in secret granted but self knowledge is as the ancient greeks might say the only knowledge worth having this kind of novel is very hard to pull off what 's the point if such books do n't give us something we could n't get from a well written history or from a journal and yet bestowing too much modern acumen on the central figures can be fatal a show off game that you quickly tire of louisa barrett is fascinating company but not because she is a heroine she can be a little pompous ah those ancient greeks her caution gets in the way of her courage and her public rectitude is a constant at times infuriating effort to cover up and make amends for a deeply shameful episode in her past she is a politician in short she negotiates with the millionaires who sit on her school 's board grasping perfectly the commands tucked inside their compliments she admires the the well to do negro couple whose niece attends her school but since their politics anger some of her board members she keeps her distance she does the same with the well born muckraking journalist who wants her help in gathering information about misdeeds among the mighty with whom they both socialize in short she is a politician her loyalties divide and subdivide ms belfer is giving us a mystery how will her shameful past affect her actions will any of buffalo 's mighty fall she is also giving us a social and political drama set in all male clubs and factories in all female schools and settlement houses in stately mansions and asylums for the insane with presidents grover cleveland and william mckinley who was assassinated in buffalo at private standoffs between the ruling protestant and the up and coming irish catholic magnate or on a picket line between unionized east european factory workers and the negro strikebreakers denied union membership city of light and waste move between history and fiction between public events we know about and private events we can only imagine between in short the past we have to live with and the future we can still make for ourselves
