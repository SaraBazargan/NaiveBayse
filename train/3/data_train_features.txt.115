 jazz has bumped up against a lot of different kinds of music in the last 40 years almost immediately creating new genres on contact but one area that seems surprisingly cordoned off from it is electro acoustic improvisation the fairly new fully abstract music that tends to include one musician busily writing code and generating sounds on a laptop computer it 's still a small movement so if you 're a jazz musician and you achieve this fusion few will recognize the significance the most and best laptop music has come from europe and japan leaving a confusing question as to whether jazz musicians in the united states waist deep in an american idiom can or should put their own stamp on it improvisers in the electronic world shoulder plenty of modernity issues making jazz as we know it barely relevant to them so true electro acoustic jazz is n't just going to sprout naturally a few powerful vectors are needed and though they have begun to appear in japan and chicago new york has been lagging behind on the strength of a magnificent performance on thursday night at tonic the trumpeter dave douglas seems like the first jazz musician in new york who 's trying to integrate jazz played on a high level and it is unmistakably jazz with electronic improvisation his set part of a triple bill at tonic that benefited the red cross disaster relief fund drew from a new book of music written for a new band witness the themes he played are also found on his new album witness bluebird rca but in the performance he pared down the arrangements from a wild 11 piece miscellany to a hard driving sextet chris potter was a substitute on tenor saxophone sharing the front line melodies with mr douglas often ebb tide and lyrical all the pieces on witness are dedications to writers and activists who have made nonviolent responses to repressive or abusive political regimes from edward said to the egyptian novelist naguib mahfouz to the bangladeshi poet taslima nasrin melancholy was an ingredient but the music had many dimensions snapping effectively between sections spending as much time in syncopated rhythm as free improvisation there were only two breaks for applause in 90 minutes and around the composed material mr douglas kept the improvised combinations volatile the band members who also included ikue mori on laptop computer jamie saft on a distorted electric piano brad jones on bass and michael sarin on drums all shared solo time producing a real breadth of sensibility everyone was heard and always seemingly for a reason ms mori 's contributions sounds that never had real world referents but could approach bouncing marbles crinkling paper brushed bells records run backwards were loud constantly changing and furtively initiated with her at one extreme and mr potter 's learned harmonically and rhythmically complex jazz language at the other the results could have been a mess of mutually exclusive languages the set was not only coherent but full bodied and confident which felt like victory
