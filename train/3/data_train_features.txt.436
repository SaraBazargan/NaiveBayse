 al leiter had been waiting four weeks for this four weeks for a chance to pitch again and to help resuscitate his lifeless team he was so eager he said last week that he hurried his comeback from an elbow injury when he otherwise might have held back leiter is the mets no 1 starter and an ace is supposed to be a superhero bobby valentine the mets manager confronted leiter about his timetable if you need more time take it valentine told him it 's not like 'hey please al you 're ready are n't you valentine said but whether or not the mets pressured him leiter clearly wanted to be back as soon as possible last night at shea stadium he showed the mets what they had been missing leiter sparkled for six innings as the mets beat kevin brown and the los angeles dodgers 8 0 it was the mets second victory in 10 games knowing what has gone on and knowing it has n't been a whole lot of fun around here i was n't doing my share leiter said i wanted to get out there and do what i needed to do leiter 1 3 knew he needed to throw all his pitches and approach the game with an anger and aggressiveness he hates it when he is passive on the defensive and sometimes he has to motivate himself to get tough this time the motivation was a given and all of his pitches were working leiter who had a strained flexor tendon in his left elbow got three of his six strikeouts with his curveball the pitch that had caused him the most pain he compared the potential impact of this game to the one he pitched in june 1999 at yankee stadium when he beat roger clemens and helped lift the mets into contention if this game sparks the mets 15 26 it will be because of more than leiter 's effort his return and what valentine called a lively lineup propelled the mets to the kind of victory they have not had in almost two weeks the last time they won on tuesday they managed only one run the time before that the mets won 10 9 after leading by 9 0 those had been their only victories since may 5 valentine batted darren bragg leadoff for the third game in a row and started three of his fastest players timo perez tsuyoshi shinjo and desi relaford valentine managed brown in texas and knew how futile it was for hitters to try to pull brown 's hard sinkers he felt that if the right mets reached base they could put themselves in motion on the ground balls brown would inevitably induce with some speed there we definitely had a chance to create some things on the base paths relaford said with someone as tough as brown you 've got to try to create whether it 's stealing a base moving guys over hit and run you 've got to do little things the mets did little and big things against brown 5 2 things they have not done recently against less heralded pitchers all of the mets starting position players except mike piazza had a hit off brown and piazza contributed an important defensive play with gary sheffield batting with one out in the sixth leiter 's last inning piazza tracked a high twisting pop up behind the plate it landed in his glove for the second out and piazza landed hard on his tailbone just in front of the wall leiter was removed for a pinch hitter in the bottom of the inning having allowed just four hits and a walk striking out six it was his first victory since last sept 20 a span of 10 starts including four in the postseason turk wendell pitched the final three innings allowing one hit and striking out three to earn his first save there was n't any sense of urgency valentine said because al was pretty much in control the mets are a stationary base to base team even on their good days but three different mets took an extra base on a single in the first four innings relaford singled to lead off the third and with one out valentine called for a hit and run with bragg batting relaford stole second as bragg swung and missed bragg then knocked in relaford from second on a single the mets had not had a lead at any point in leiter 's three previous starts and they immediately added to it when robin ventura a 356 career hitter against brown homered to lead off the fourth the mets scored three more runs on five more hits in the inning with shinjo and perez taking extra bases the mets had a 5 0 lead then and brown was finished he worked a season low four innings and surrendered a season high five runs and nine hits you ca n't go out there and pitch like that and expect to stay in the game brown said leiter for his part did not want to guess at how much his presence lifted his teammates it 's mighty big of someone to think they 're the reason he said ventura also found it difficult to characterize he just knew it made him happy you 're always glad to have your best pitcher ventura said knowing that he 's going every five days is a big boost inside pitch left fielder benny agbayani said he had fully recovered from the strained abdominal muscle injury he sustained last saturday but manager bobby valentine gave him an extra day out of the starting lineup as a precaution shortstop rey ordonez did not start because of back spasms he first felt while jumping off the bench to watch the flight of a potential homer in tuesday 's game ordonez said the condition worsened from thursday to yesterday a committee of mets coaches will manage the team today as valentine attends his son bobby jr 's high school graduation in arlington tex
