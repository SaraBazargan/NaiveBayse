 a closing notice was posted again earlier this week at the apollo theater for george c wolfe 's harlem song a musical that tells the cultural and social history of harlem over the past century the previous week though had been the best since its summer opening according to john schreiber the lead producer and he remains optimistic that the show will continue its run as planned until dec 31 talks go on with potential backers about the 300000 the production needs to ensure that future the closing of harlem song would be a disappointment for the group of visionaries who wanted it to be an entertaining 90 minutes of music and dance that tell the story of african american and hispanic migrants to northern manhattan of course it 's a commercial venture but it 's one with as one supporter put it a nonprofit sensibility one of the producers goals was to give people from elsewhere a reason to visit harlem see its revitalization including the 13 million facelift of the apollo and sample its restaurants and other attractions they seem to be accomplishing some of those goals even though the theater has not always been as full as they had hoped it has been a boon to harlem 's new generation of high end restaurants and has certainly expanded some tourists vision of how far new york 's theater district extends unfortunately one thing theatergoers are also discovering is the validity of harlem residents longtime complaints about the difficulty of getting a cab with limited money for marketing producers have depended in large part on the willingness of a group of some 200 volunteers to spread the word about the show and to encourage group ticket sales despite its identification in harlem song 's program as one of the production 's sponsors and promotional partners this newspaper is neither a limited joint marketing project never went beyond preliminary discussions the volunteers efforts are paying off in advance ticket sales for the holiday season money that would have to be refunded if immediate cash needs were n't met and harlem song had to close early if that happened it would be a setback to efforts to eliminate boundaries real and imagined in manhattan 's cultural landscape
