 only a handful of the books first published in london in the sober year of 1653 are still read today even by scholars and only one of that year 's first editions has gone on over the next three and a half centuries to be reprinted again and again and to find new readers every year that book is izaak walton 's the compleat angler or the contemplative man 's recreation being a discourse of fish and fishing not unworthy the perusal of most anglers there is hardly any assessing how different our world is from walton 's from 2003 1653 looks like a vastly simpler time if only because there were fewer lawyers as walton puts it but simplicity is always deceiving the compleat angler was published just five years after england had hung its king and brought civil war to an end under the puritan rule of oliver cromwell yet what walton asks is simply this is it not an art to deceive a trout with an artificial fly he asks it not as a scholar of angling sitting in a musty room filled with old books and tackle but in the persona of piscator the fisherman who teaches venator the hunter how to fish during a beautiful outing in may and what makes walton interesting even now is that the art of being an angler was far more complex in his day than it is in ours walton 's kind of fisherman had to be able to discourse on pliny and to quote st augustine and to consider the analogies between his art and that of the fishers of men who were called apostles his angler needed to be able to sing as well as bait a hook or tie a fly he should revel in the pleasures of the countryside and the companionship of other anglers venator soon qualifies as a fisherman not just because he catches fish but also because he has a genuine delicacy of soul let 's go to that house venator says at the end of the day for the linen looks white and smells of lavender and i long to lie in a pair of sheets that smell so if to us piscator sounds didactic and a little long winded praising water for instance because it allows the english to travel easily to rome venator 's patience is only magnified as a result it is indeed an art to deceive a trout with an artificial fly now as well as then but by art walton means something much more inclusive than technique as the two men walk along in the shade of a honeysuckle hedge piscator turns from the technical matter of painting a fly rod to a question of much greater importance thankfulness fishing may be a contemplative person 's recreation but it 's even more fitting for a person who has also taught himself to be thankful piscator 's by word in a world full of suffering is simply this every misery that i miss is a new mercy to tie your own flies gather your own bait make your own tackle to sing well to quote learnedly to know the seasons of the trout and which winds are preferable for fishing to love the scent of lavender in an ale house window to fish thankfully   these are just the beginnings of the angler 's duties in walton 's eyes he lived in a time when a fisherman might hate otters still common then for destroying trout but even walton knew that the love of his sport meant first of all a care for nature which we believe too often at our peril can take care of itself i remember he wrote that a wise friend of mine did usually say 'that which is everybody 's business is nobody 's business our business after all this time has passed is still to learn from walton editorial observer correction may 28 2003 wednesday an editorial observer published on saturday about izaak walton mistakenly asserted that charles i had been executed by hanging he was beheaded in 1649 four years not five before the publication of the compleat angler
