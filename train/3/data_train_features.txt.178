 the families of two east meadow residents who died of west nile virus one four weeks ago and the other yesterday are blaming nassau county for not spraying against infected mosquitoes and say they will sue for wrongful death my father 's dead because they did n't spray charles fink said today we 're definitely going to file a lawsuit his father karl w fink 77 died of complications early thanksgiving morning at winthrop university hospital here after fighting the disease for nine weeks karl fink was hospitalized on the same intensive care ward as the other victim adeline bisignano 71 who died on oct 26 although the two families lived less than a mile apart in east meadow they did not know each other until they became acquainted during hospital visits mrs bisignano 's husband frank expressed similar views if the county would have taken precautions beforehand maybe my wife would have been alive today mr bisignano said it could have been avoided he said he had already consulted a lawyer nassau sprayed insecticide by helicopter in 1999 when the west nile virus first appeared in the new york region and in 2000 did limited spraying by truck in one corner of the county nassau 's decision not to spray this year contrasted with the policies of its neighboring municipalities new york city on the west and suffolk county on the east both of which continued spraying this year six city residents and one from suffolk were sickened but all survived nassau had two other residents who were sickened nassau officials expressed sorrow over the deaths but defended the county 's policy it certainly is a tragedy these two deaths said a health department spokeswoman cynthia d brown after the east meadow cases were diagnosed ms brown said we did increase surveillance in that area but we did n't find evidence of mosquito infestation that was why the county decided against spraying earlier in the season she said we did not find the number of mosquitoes in traps to justify spraying basically it 's a risk assessment ms brown noted that many residents oppose spraying citing fears that the insecticide will harm people or the environment it 's quite a hullabaloo she said but the finks and the bisignanos say that the two east meadow cases should have raised red flags and prompted belated spraying to prevent any further spread of the disease the families said that the two victims both retirees spent nearly all their time at home and were undoubtedly infected there we would like to see this not happen to any other family mr fink said there are still mosquitoes around and we can see them they try to come in when it 's cold i saw one in my car the day before yesterday it 's absolutely wrong not to spray where there is a deadly disease mr bisignano too voiced worries about prevention i could have been bitten he said my neighbors could have been bitten the west nile virus is found in southern europe and much of africa the middle east and south and central asia its arrival in new york in 1999 was its first appearance in north america and it has rapidly spread as far as florida and the midwest the virus is carried by mosquitoes which get it by biting infected animals and spread it by biting uninfected animals migrating birds contribute to the spread of the virus contracting it from mosquitoes in one place and then spreading it to new mosquitoes somewhere else there is no known treatment for west nile virus many humans survive infection with few or no symptoms experts say while some become sick and even develop meningitis or encephalitis most of those who are stricken survive but mortality is higher among the elderly
