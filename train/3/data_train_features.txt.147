 the free throw by connecticut 's taliek brown bounced off the rim and the huskies putback also missed finally seton hall had something to celebrate so in the moments following the pirates 65 63 victory today their players and fans joined to form a mosh pit in front of the pirates bench the emotions of relief may be fleeting and they could extinguish in the next few days but for the first time in weeks the pirates have a future darius lane who did not start after arriving late for a meeting earlier this week made the go ahead 3 pointer with 61 seconds left to give seton hall the victory at continental arena in front of 18055 its largest home crowd in five years it 's definitely a relief lane said it 's been an up and down season for our team and myself this was a big shot for myself and a big win for our team seton hall 14 13 over all 5 11 big east squeaked into next week 's big east tournament and avoided having to watch rutgers 's game against providence this afternoon to find out its fate rutgers entered the day in last place one game behind the pirates in the west division but held the tie breaker because it had swept the pirates but seton hall 's victory made rutgers 's outcome moot and set up a matchup of two disappointing programs seton hall and st john 's which did not play in the regular season meet in the first round of the conference tournament on wednesday at 2 pm at madison square garden the pirates most likely guaranteed themselves a postseason they avoided having a losing record and qualified for consideration for the national invitation tournament connecticut 19 10 8 8 earned a no 6 seeding and will play either georgetown or syracuse which both play sunday depending on which team finishes third in the west trailing 63 62 seton hall regained possession with 179 seconds left following a traveling call on connecticut 's caron butler his second in the closing minutes pirates coach tommy amaker designed the play for lane to run off two screens on the baseline and take the final shot pirates guard ty shine dribbled into the corner and passed to lane who hit the 25 foot jumper with 61 seconds left lane had arrived late for a meeting with amaker this week causing his removal from the starting lineup amaker said lane probably felt upset and embarrassed with the demotion but lane said he was more motivated by the pirates loss at villanova on wednesday he scored 5 points in that game and his friends and family in minnesota watched that game on television and told him it was the worst they 've ever seen me play lane said we just did n't look like we wanted to play he said this was a total turnaround despite a messy first half today seton hall played with intensity to snap a three game losing streak and win for only the third time in 13 games and lane said eddie even came out and played hard eddie griffin who scored a game high 16 points has been booed by pirates fans for his sometimes passive effort but he too found a winning ending connecticut called a timeout with 18 seconds left and edmund saunders inbounded the ball to brown on the perimeter but the seton hall freshman marcus toney el was caught in a switch tripped and ran into brown for a foul with half a second remaining brown a freshman missed the front end of the one and one and connecticut 's johnnie selvie missed the tip in igniting the celebration i guess it was a good thing i fouled taliek because there was a lot of pressure on him toney el said griffin said he felt mad after the foul but then felt fortunate because selvie had leaped over him for the tip oh it 's going to be my fault now griffin said he told himself griffin said he never considered that this may have been his final college game he bypassed a chance to play in the national basketball association so he could attend seton hall and said he has not decided whether to return for his sophomore season or enter the nba draft seton hall 's troubles this season began jan 6 when griffin punched shine in the locker room after he felt shine was not passing him the ball shine was the darling of the pirates run to the round of 16 last season today shine scored all 8 of his points in the second half his three free throws with 7 minutes 1 second left gave the pirates their first lead in three games ty 's always made big baskets big shots for us his entire career amaker said i think he has the confidence and the guts to do those things rebounds this was seton hall coach tommy amaker 's first victory over connecticut in eight attempts the pirates last crowd this big was also against uconn seton hall drew 20029 on march 2 1996
