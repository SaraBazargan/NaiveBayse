 a forecast 15 knot westerly breeze failed to materialize today forcing the cancellation of race 7 in the louis vuitton finals between san francisco 's america one syndicate and italy 's prada challenge the five of nine series to select the next america 's cup challenger remains tied at three apiece racing is scheduled to resume on friday under fresh 15 20 knot southwesterlies when it does paul cayard 's america one team will continue to compete against the well heeled italian squad backed by the fortune of the prada fashion magnate patrizio bertelli under a distinct disadvantage vince lombardi once expressed his disdain for the forward pass as a simple matter of percentages when you lofted the pigskin downfield he reasoned three things could happen and two of them an interception or an incompletion were bad likewise in a series that has thus far been defined by how each team reacts when they hoist their spinnakers for the downwind legs several scenarios have transpired when the so called kites went skyward and many of them have had disastrous consequences botched takedowns questionable tactics exploding fabric all three snafus have turned the tide in this maddeningly close series where one mistake has often been one too many the italians have a weapon in their arsenal however that in most situations give them an upper hand on the downwind legs a super strong cloth from which their spinnakers are constructed called cuben fiber the fabric a high tech composite weave of spectra and mylar materials took its name from bill koch 's america cubed syndicate which developed the fabric during its winning america 's cup defense in 1992 it 's tough versatile and expensive and it gives the italians not only a deep sense of reassurance but a tactical edge as well comparatively speaking cayard 's spinnakers he carries two types some of which are built of nylon some of polyester are to cuben fiber what paper towels are to terry cloth the proof has been underscored time and again during the nearly four month long qualifying series in that span the italians have torn one or two spinnakers the americans have gone through at least eight including three thus far in the finals tactically cuben fiber gives the italians the ability to sail higher angles to the breeze when sailing downwind knowing that if the americans follow they stand a good chance of blowing out their sail because of the increased pressure and if the sail goes all too often the chances of victory go as well moreover the italians have cornered the current market on cuben fiber cayard could n't get his hands on the magic material even if he could afford it my understanding of it is that for their heavy spinnakers they 've got basically exclusive access to it he said their kites cost around sixty or seventy grand each he added they bought all the production of that cloth for this period even though it 's probably more than they need they just basically took it out of action cayard 's spinnakers cost about a third of those built from cuben fiber but prada skipper francesco de angelis feels his sails are a bargain it 's expensive sure he laughed but if you can save by buying one instead of six or seven it 's better the americans got the last laugh in race 6 however when the italians botched a spinnaker takedown at a critical moment for the second straight race and the sail wrapped around the rudder giving cayard his critical opening in a wild comeback victory which completed a surge from a 3 1 deficit they finally ripped a bulletproof 70000 spinnaker he said and the bad news for them is that when one of those spinnakers gets wrapped around the rudder they do n't come off ours would fall off like toilet paper cayard was also grinning when he made that observation but if the weathermen call for more breeze and the forecast says they will america one 's supporters will continue to hold their collective breath when their crew 's spinnakers are hauled aloft and snap full in the gusty air yacht racing
