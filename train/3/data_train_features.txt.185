 russia 's use of a dangerous incapacitating gas to knock out chechen terrorists who had seized more than 750 hostages at a moscow theater has underscored the urgent need to develop safer methods to immobilize hostage takers without harming their hostages the powerful gas which was pumped in through the theater 's ventilation system killed at least 116 of the hostages and sent hundreds more to the hospital whether the high death toll was deemed acceptable collateral damage or was the result of a terrible miscalculation is not known russia needs to provide fuller details on the assault and its harm to the hostages such information could help this country and others prepare to deal with future terrorist takeovers the agent used against the chechen terrorists was most likely an aerosol version of a potent fast acting opiate called fentanyl that is used as an anesthetic for horses whatever the specific chemical it falls into the category of incapacitating agents which are supposed to be nonlethal the only trouble is the difference between an incapacitating dose and a lethal dose can be very narrow in hospital operating rooms anesthetics are administered with great care under close monitoring lest too high a dose prove lethal such careful calibration is impossible when the gas must be dispersed in a large area at a dose level strong enough to disable large numbers of people quickly a safer more humane technology is needed in a long search for good incapacitants scientists have investigated chemical and biological agents loud noises microwaves high intensity light and obnoxious odors all have drawbacks that either impede their effectiveness or risk lasting harm to people exposed the federal government is said to be supporting research on nonlethal weapons that could be more effective than the pepper spray and tear gas typically used by police for crowd control but the extent of the effort is murky like any weapon incapacitating agents could be abused perhaps disseminated to quell a peaceful political protest or used to disable people for summary execution as may have happened in moscow some applications may also run afoul of arms control agreements but in an age of terrorism it would surely be desirable to develop a mist that could put people to sleep quickly without harming them permanently this is an area that congress needs to explore more fully for homeland defense
