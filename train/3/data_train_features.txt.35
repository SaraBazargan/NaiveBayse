 nancy wilson spoke about her career in the past tense on monday night at avery fisher hall i wanted to sing songs she said in her tragic purr i wanted to interpret it was about the material it was about telling you some stories and i 've been doing that for a long time she may or may not be retiring as she put it she 's trying to stop touring as she also put it touring is a young word these days i work but in any case her performance was a retrospective representing more than 40 years in jazz pop and rhythm and blues most of it was with thickly piled orchestral accompaniment and a little with a jazz quintet including jeremy pelt on trumpet and vincent herring on alto saxophone ms wilson 65 and looking smashing comes from a time when the intersection of commercial adult music and the jazz subculture sprouted brilliant results the time of records like charlie parker with strings sarah vaughan 's work for the mercury label and ms wilson 's own recordings with cannonball adderley and gerald wilson but her guiding sensibility her aesthetic as an entertainer goes back further she 's like the omni american 1940 's film star both earthy and genteel her voice is a terrine of flat ohio vowels and affected britishisms her singing a mixture of flexible blues tonality and a more direct pop sensibility with such gifts one need n't worry about what constitutes jazz and what does n't but all things are n't equal she has her particular strengths the show 's up tempo songs strike up the band day in day out sprinted by without leaving much of an imprint what ms wilson can do best is to get inside a ballad and upend it drawing out some syllables and clipping others in a slow someone to watch over me when she got to the line i 'm a little lamb she turned on the jets for the first word spreading it out and drawing the marrow from it
