 allen iverson rocked to a rhythm only he could feel tonight stopping and popping fading away to find twine slashing with brash assurance and finishing with soft finger rolls iverson the smallest player on the court at 6 feet tall created an electrical storm every time he touched the ball and then with 159 seconds remaining in game 2 of the eastern conference semifinal series against the toronto raptors iverson the philadelphia 76ers all star guard turned to the first union fans between free throws he cupped his ear to challenge them to yell louder opened his mouth wide flung back his head and roared exhaling the energy that propelled him to his stunning 54 point performance iverson went back to the foul line and added his final point of the night his team 's 19th in a row as the sixers went on to finish off the raptors 97 92 and even the series heading back to toronto at one game apiece tonight it was just a great player having an incredible night sixers coach larry brown said shaking his head it was a pretty inspiring performance in the sixers game 1 defeat iverson hit only 11 of his 34 shots and scored 36 points and he was determined tonight to improve on that he made 21 of 39 shots piling 20 points into the second quarter and 19 of the sixers final 20 points in the fourth his 54 points were a team playoff high and tied the career high he set this season on jan 6 against cleveland when he was taken out of the game for the first time there were only 14 seconds left that 's something you expect every night especially of me iverson said matter of factly last game i took what they gave me they gave me wide open jumpers i took a lot of quick shots and guys were n't in rebounding position i had a lot of time to think about it because i could n't sleep after that first loss i said 'rather than what they give me i 'm not going to look at it like that i will take everything i want do n't settle for anything iverson settled for nothing less than spectacular taking advantage of the raptors surprising lack of a double team i feel like the only player who can stop me is myself he said in the process he left his teammates stunned how many guys are you going to see come into a playoff game and just dominate at 6 feet just doing what you want out on the floor aaron mckie said it 's a beautiful thing it just comes at such a spectacular time with the playoffs an intense atmosphere and everyone chanting 'mvp i 'm lost for words just watching his performance he carried us the whole game eric snow was the only other sixer to score in double figures with 10 points it did not matter toronto 's superstar vince carter scored 28 points but only 4 in the crucial final period which the raptors entered trailing by 2 73 71 when you see those two kids it 's hard to believe the game is in trouble brown said but adding of iverson we just rode the great horse tonight it does n't get much better than that performance with nine minutes remaining and the sixers ahead by just 77 75 iverson scored his team 's next 19 points the teams were tied 80 80 with 7 minutes 50 seconds to play when iverson hit a 3 pointer the sixers would never relinquish their lead he followed with a 12 foot runner a driving finger roll another cool jumper iverson had brought his team back from a 14 point deficit with 10 10 to play in the second quarter with the seconds waning in the first half he rocked from left foot to right conducting a crossover dribble clinic letting toronto 's chris childs watch him like a cat peering up at a dangling ball of yarn iverson at the last second let go a 22 foot jumper and it shimmied down the net as the buzzer sounded finding the perfect groove the sixers led at halftime 49 47 and answered toronto 's rallies each time in the second half the raptors never changed their strategy on iverson we considered it raptors coach lenny wilkens said of a double team a couple of times we wanted to turn him into a double team area but we did n't do it iverson knew with the sixers trailing in the series and trailing early at home that he had to drive the lane and make the open shots you expect to play well every night he said the only thing you care about is getting the win
