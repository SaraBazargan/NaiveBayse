 over nearly seven decades robert david lion gardiner the last heir to carry the name of one of long island 's original settler families spent untold amounts for the upkeep of sagtikos manor a historic house in west bay shore where washington slept first as the owner and since 1986 as the head of a nonprofit foundation dedicated to maintaining the rambling 42 room wood frame structure mr gardiner now 90 has said his unswerving purpose was to contribute to long island history the house listed on the national register of historic places in 1976 was opened to the public until recently as a museum but has been closed lately now as the foundation negotiates to sell the house and its 10 acre property to suffolk county for a price yet to be determined mr gardiner a multimillionaire is being politely but pointedly asked to make one last contribution all the house 's furnishings including paintings antique clocks tables chairs dishes and what may be the bed in which george washington spent a night during his tour of long island in 1790 whether the contribution is mr gardiner 's to make is in dispute but his willingness to make one last grand gesture may be needed to quell a potentially nasty legal fight alerted that as many as 63 items had been removed from the house and were to be auctioned off at christie 's in manhattan on friday the state attorney general 's office moved swiftly to block the sale the items had an estimated value of more than 1 million the state officials also headed off a sale by south bay auctions of east moriches news of the planned auctions whipped through bay shore there was disbelief said nancy donohue president of the sagtikos manor historical society mr gardiner has always been so interested in preserving the house and the furnishings his family has owned that house since 1758 denis j mcelligott the assistant attorney general in charge of the suffolk office said last week that his office believed furnishings in the house belonged to the foundation if they did he said the foundation 's tax exempt status meant it would need permission from the attorney general before divesting assets but joseph r attonito a lawyer for mr gardiner and a trustee of the foundation has maintained that the furnishings are the personal property of mr gardiner according to mr mcelligott mr attonito agreed to postpone the auction after the attorney general 's office threatened legal action against mr gardiner our suggestion is that mr gardiner realize that the furnishings were always assets of the not for profit foundation and therefore will be sold with the house mr mcelligott said mr attonito said no threat was needed he said mr gardiner and his wife eunice 73 had readily acquiesced to the state 's request for a postponement mr attonito said that he and the attorney general 's office were near an agreement on the disposition of the furnishings and the future of sagtikos manor itself he said he could not discuss details but said part of the settlement was that the personal furnishing would be returned to the house an array of islip town suffolk and state officials and local residents are aligned in a new group the committee to preserve sagtikos manor that is planning for the transition of the manor into a county owned historical site managed by a not for profit organization it 's a tremendous undertaking but it can be done said robert b mckay director of the society for the preservation of long island antiquities if the county acquires the house it would be one of their flagship properties preservationists are worried that the house is vulnerable and needs to be secured quickly last month the suffolk police arrested an antique dealer anthony pizzirusso of babylon near the manor 's entrance on montauk highway as he loaded an antique table into his car the police charged him with breaking into the house and removing antiques over several days they said the items were recovered the suffolk county legislature unanimously approved the purchase of the house in october the preservation of a house where our first president actually slept is really very significant said angie carpenter a republican county legislator from west islip who sponsored the bill for the county purchase i see this as the south shore 's answer to sagamore hill whether mr gardiner shared these sentiments could not be learned he has an unlisted telephone number in florida where he resides during the winter he and his wife also have a home in east hampton and the gardiner family has owned gardiners island the largest privately owned island on the east coast since the 17th century mr gardiner received sagtikos manor and 1200 surrounding acres stretching from great south bay nearly eight miles inland as a gift in 1933 from his aunt sarah diodati gardiner all but the 10 acres surrounding the mansion are now developed or part of a county park named for the gardiner family sagtikos manor was nearly a century old when washington slept there on april 21 1790 during his victory tour of long island to thank supporters of the american revolution legend has it that the owner a local magistrate named isaac thompson offered washington the best guest room in the house but that the president chose a smaller chamber that today remains much as it was then
