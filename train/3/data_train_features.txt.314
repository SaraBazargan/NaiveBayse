 they had a practice session once when they were kids that began at 8 o'clock in the morning and lasted until 3 in the afternoon venus and serena williams battled each other for what amounted to a school day because as venus said when you 're little you just keep hitting and hitting when you get older the time 's less and less at the ripe old age of 21 venus williams and 19 year old serena kept another 8 o'clock date to hit last night the prime time realization of a family 's and television network 's improbable dream the storybook ending to the united states open two african american sisters from the inner city in a stadium named for arthur ashe all they were being asked to do finally and forever was live up to the moment rise above the emotion of a life together a bedroom shared complementary games unlike the contrasting styles of agassi and sampras or martina and chris but after all the sisterly psychology the indisputable reality was that venus williams is the best player of her country the world and her family as well a match that was preceded by diana ross singing god bless america and a fireworks show befitting the fourth of july was played far above prior suspicions of match fixing and in flashes beyond qualitative levels of their previous play venus williams who defended her title in a 6 2 6 4 victory is just too consistent and confident at this point for not so little sis while serena sprayed 36 unforced errors venus was patient and grounded a martina hingis with six extra inches and a steady 115 plus mile an hour serve i love you she said hugging serena at the net and what else was there to say except congratulations to both the sisters came to new york and handled the questions about them the way they dealt with opponents with grace and guile consistently returning for flat out winners they avoided the baits the traps the pervasive undercurrent of race criticized in the past for not being gracious they went out of their way to credit the vanquished serena warmly received lindsay davenport after their quarterfinal match just two months after davenport ridiculed her at wimbledon as a chronic excuse maker venus was complimentary of jennifer capriati after their semifinal friday even though capriati known for rushing on her own serve became upset at venus for doing likewise staring her down capriati barely made eye contact while shaking hands for the most part they have conducted themselves with admirable restraint ignoring or disavowing their father 's more grandiose pronouncements it 's bad enough that the sisters have been held accountable for their father 's behavior it 's worse that the williamses refined and reasoned mother oracene is typically a family afterthought for a news media as quick to denounce richard williams as it is to provide him a forum if the father constructed his daughter 's backhands it is clear that oracene williams has been the architect of their public comportment which has been scrutinized like no other player 's and especially for the sensational occurrences of williams versus williams a lot of the matches we played have n't been considered championship heroic matches venus said the least of which was the semifinal at indian wells last spring that venus did n't play defaulting minutes before they were due on court she could have handled it better and i 'd wager will from here on out we should also remember that other brother and sister acts that have been described as unpleasant to torturous by the various participants in more than 20 professional matches among the three maleeva sisters the older sister won all but one an injury default self imposed pressure is what it is but the others from the maleevas to the mcenroes played nowhere near a grand slam final in their home country a milestone occasion created with this very match in mind we definitely could have a rivalry serena said saying she was at least past the feeling of sisterly dread we could really get the sparks going there was some tension in the second set as serena tried to slug her way into the match encouraged by a celebrity studded crowd hoping an event might yet be an epic venus with a borg like stoicism masking the discomfort of having to humble serena on the most celebrated night of their tennis lives was not more powerful just too good i think venus has actually taken power off her ball using tactics to make less mistakes serena would say calling the night windy and weird serena flailed in a stiff breeze venus figured out how to play through it it is no mystery why she has won four of the last six slams her toughest lesson was learned on the day she watched serena win the first family slam here two years ago venus said she took something from watching serena that night how to be a competitor it was serena 's turn last night to prove she could play at venus 's ascendant level that she could n't probably has less to do with the complexities of sisterhood of being 17 months apart and entered into the same race and more to do with the best player in the world playing another from the rest of a very good pack nothing to question there nothing to apologize for two sisters beat incredible odds just getting to this night to prime time for that they deserve universal praise and respect
