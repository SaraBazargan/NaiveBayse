 the newly opened sir william 's dog run is the city 's only run whose fence keeps dogs out not in last weekend to the delight of dog lovers the acre of sloping land not far from the cloisters in fort tryon park became the parks department 's first unfenced off leash area the small fence keeps dogs from harming the roots of a towering beech tree on a corner of the lawn dogs may run where they want as owners stand around like parents at a soccer game breaking up the occasional squabble when friendly jostling leads to unexpected snarling the lack of perimeter fencing is partly because of the area 's landscape it is nearly enclosed by rocky outcroppings shrubs and retaining walls that isolate it from the rest of the park but residents and park officials also credited an unusual level of cooperation between residents and government when other suggested spots for a dog run did not work out a group of owners invited the local parks chief jane schachat to what was then known as the gazebo lawn by summer 's end they had reached an agreement to declare an off leash zone some of the battles to get dog runs in the city have turned into long fights with parks said persio logos president of the dog owners group this was a positive proactive approach we kept the lines of communication open mr logos was host to a low key soiree in his washington heights home oct 18 to introduce the idea to community groups parks commissioner henry j stern came with his golden retriever boomer to dedicate the area as sir william 's dog run named after sir william tryon the last colonial governor of new york dog owners are often the most faithful users of areas of the park that others do n't use mr stern said we 're happy to have them as long as they follow the rules to some extent the change simply legalized the status quo dog owners had been using the space for years as an unofficial off leash area but mostly before 9 am and after 9 pm when leash laws are less strictly enforced now they no longer have to choose between watching the clock or risking a 100 fine repaired street lamps are also encouraging people and dogs to come at night the dog run is open 24 hours a day monday morning around 8 30 a park regular luther a border collie black labrador mix was playing with his friends at the dog run it was really nice to see everybody get together and say 'ok you can do this legally and we wo n't yell at you anymore said todd crain 29 an actor and luther 's owner luther was too busy socializing to notice the difference seth kugel
