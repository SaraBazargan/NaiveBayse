 uncle tungsten memories of a chemical boyhood by oliver sacks illustrated 337 pages alfred a knopf 25 the son of two physicians in wartime england oliver sacks says it was understood almost from my birth that i would be a doctor and in fact he would grow up to become a doctor a humane philosophical doctor uncommonly attuned to the passion and pathos of his patients and the astonishing resilience of human life as his earlier books awakenings an anthropologist on mars the man who mistook his wife for a hat so eloquently attest dr sacks 's first love however was not medicine but chemistry and in his new memoir uncle tungsten he gives us a moving account of his childhood ardor for science for numbers for the chemical elements for formulas and systems science offered this shy young boy bullied and abused at school and rocked by the convulsions of world war ii a kind a refuge it offered him the promise of stability and order in an unstable world no one better conveys the romance of science than mr sacks in these pages he not only communicates his own boyhood fascination with the magical realm of chemistry with the mysterious qualities of the different elements their resonant names and pungent smells and colors but he also leaves us with an appreciation of the beauty and economy of the natural world the mathematical workings as he puts it of god 's abacus the periodic table was incredibly beautiful the most beautiful thing i had ever seen mr sacks writes of the table of the elements first glimpsed by him in 1945 at the science museum in south kensington london i could never adequately analyze what i meant here by beauty simplicity coherence rhythm inevitability or was it the symmetry the comprehensiveness of every element firmly locked into its place with no gaps no exceptions everything implying everything else the periodic table like other scientific breakthroughs also gave the young mr sacks intimations of the transcendent power of the human mind and the fact that it might be equipped to discover or decipher the deepest secrets of nature to read the mind of god he developed a keen admiration for dmitri mendeleev the genius behind the periodic table and a deep sense of identification with the early 19th century poet chemist humphry davy whose scientific enthusiasm and dangerous impulsiveness so closely mirrored his own with the encouragement of his uncle dave or uncle tungsten as he was known because he manufactured light bulbs with filaments of fine tungsten wire and uncle abe his physics uncle the young oliver began an apprenticeship in science at an early age he spent hours searching for prime numbers memorizing them playing with them in his head later he tried to replicate famous experiments in chemistry and physics spending nights and weekends in a makeshift laboratory set up in his parents house mr sacks speculates that he sought out the special dangers of chemistry and many of his experiments were dangerous given the easy accessibility during his childhood of volatile and even toxic chemicals as a means of playing with such fears persuading myself that by care and vigilance prudence forethought one could learn to control or find a way through this hazardous world already several events in his childhood had left him with a heightened sense of the precariousness of life at age 6 like many boys in london during the blitz he was sent away to a boarding school in the country there his fears of abandonment were made worse by the bullying of older boys and brutal beatings at the hands of a sadistic headmaster the experience robbed him of his faith in god and left him with a host of fears fears of crossing the street fears of other children fears of illnesses and death his older brother michael who also suffered severe beatings at school he writes would later become psychotic given to messianic fantasies or delusions to distance himself from michael 's madness and his fears that something similar would happen to him oliver immersed himself in the worlds of mineralogy and chemistry and physics in science focusing on them holding myself together in the chaos in a passage that hints at the wellsprings of mr sacks 's sympathetic understanding as a doctor he writes it was not that i was indifferent to michael i felt a passionate sympathy for him i half knew what he was going through but i had to keep a distance also create my own world from the neutrality and beauty of nature so that i would not be swept into the chaos the madness the seduction of his when mr sacks departs from the narrative of his childhood to serve up lengthy digressions on the finer points of rare earth metals or electromagnetic reactions his writing can lapse into textbook lecturing but even these dense scientific passages are enlivened by his boyish wonder at the amazing logic and strangeness of the world his descriptions of life in pre world war ii london and the subsequent changes in the postwar city are both sweet and sour animated in equal parts by nostalgia for a vanished era and aversion for the ordeals he suffered as a child by age 15 he observes his passion for chemistry had begun to fade the boy who had once identified with the inert gases those elements unable because of their chemical structure to form compounds began to hunger for the human the personal at the same time the nature of chemistry had begun to change as well the ad hoc hands on laboratory work of the 19th century giving way to a more theoretical brand of science informed by quantum mechanics but while mr sacks 's dreams of becoming a chemist slowly receded as he prepared to become a doctor he has managed to preserve in this affecting book that sweet interlude when he spent hours enchanted totally absorbed wandering making discoveries in the enchanted garden of mendeleev
