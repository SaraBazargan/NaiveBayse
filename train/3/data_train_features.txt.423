 following are excerpts from ariel sharon 's speech yesterday to a special session of the israeli parliament as provided by the prime minister 's office the full text is available at nytimescom world our dead lie in a long row women and children young and old and we stand facing them facing the vacuum created by their murders and we are speechless on the recent evening of the seder while i was sitting with my family at the table i received the terrible news of the massacre in netanya there is no more dreadful moment in the term of a prime minister than that horrendous moment when the telephone rings or a note is passed during a meeting and carrying job 's tidings and then the sights and sounds come rushing in the sights of destruction the cries of the wounded the sirens then the awful silence of the funerals the faces and human stories which stare at us from the newspapers victims of coexistence those whose worlds fell apart while eating at an arab restaurant in haifa their blood mixing with the blood of israeli arabs who were sitting beside them entire families jewish and arab are destroyed in the heat of the murderous insanity which has taken hold of our palestinian neighbors and thus the killers and dispatchers intend to destroy the hope for peace hope for the future and hope for a normal life it is not a coincidence it is not cruel fate the murderous gangs have a leader a purpose and a directing hand they have one mission to chase us out of here from everywhere from our home in elon moreh and from the supermarket in jerusalem from the cafe in tel aviv and from the restaurant in haifa from the synagogue in netzarim where the murderers slaughtered over 70 worshipers walking in their prayer shawls to morning prayers and from the seder table in netanya and there is one dispatcher palestinian authority chairman yasir arafat he is the man who in a series of agreements promised to abandon the path of terrorism refrain from committing murder use his forces to prevent it and betrayed all his promises because of his promises israel agreed to the establishment of the palestinian authority that is why israel agreed to transfer security responsibility in the areas given to its control thus israel agreed to the establishment of palestinian security forces we hoped that the palestinians would understand as they promised that ruling does not mean a license to kill but rather the assumption of responsibility for the prevention of killing we never intended and do not intend to permanently reoccupy palestinian cities in my talks with president bush and recognizing his sincere wish for peace in our region i have promised to make every effort to accelerate our military activities and to withdraw our forces from those places in which our actions have been completed in these security zones our forces will deploy to constitute a buffer between palestinian territories and our territories in order to prevent any penetration into israeli communities attacks on israeli citizens and threats to our security but peace can only be attained if once we evacuate the territories we find a responsible palestinian leadership willing to accept the primary responsibility of every regime to prevent the use of its territory for the purpose of killing and murdering its neighbors accordingly israel accepts and warmly welcomes the important initiative of us president george w bush since the horrific attack on sept 11th exactly one year after the outbreak of the palestinian terrorist campaign against israel the united states has been leading the world in a heroic struggle to uproot terrorism as well as the regimes which support and sponsor it israel is proud of its friendship with the united states and of america 's leadership in the moral and historic political military struggle against the forces of evil which have risen up against the civilized nations since that deadly attack in september the partnership between israelis and americans has unfortunately become a partnership of blood between victims of terror we are partners to the principle set forth by president bush in his most recent speech and i quote terror must be stopped no nation can negotiate with terrorists for there is no way to make peace with those whose only goal is death if such a palestinian leadership should arise it will find in israel a hand extended toward peace and negotiations peace is important to israel but not only to israel it is important to the palestinians because only through peace will they find their way to existence as a nation in dignity and prosperity peace is important to all the peoples of the middle east because the continuation of terror and violence encourages fundamentalist elements and regimes to try and achieve their goals through violence despite the extreme demands included in the resolutions of the conference of arab leaders in beirut i welcome the fact that an important arab leader such as abdullah of saudi arabia has for the first time acknowledged israel 's right to exist within secure and recognized borders there is a positive component of the saudi initiative but the details must be negotiated in the absence of open dialogue between the parties this initiative will remain devoid of any real content the united states can and should be a leading and driving force behind such an initiative us secretary of state colin powell will be arriving in the region this week i intend to discuss methods of achieving an end to terrorism and advancing my initiative to meet with regional leaders in order to restart the negotiating process on the framework for peace in the middle east
