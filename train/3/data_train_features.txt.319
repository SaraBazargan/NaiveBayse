 directed by john t ryan not rated 74 minutes john t ryan 's film freaks glam gods and rock stars is more than just a far reaching catalog of the kaleidoscopic area of new york 's underground rock scene in which punk drag and performance art giddily collide this movie is an unabashed if often barbed celebration of new york as the one place on earth where you can be your most outrageous gender bent self be appreciated for it and even make money at it if many of the people interviewed for the film especially the hair stylists makeup artists and event organizers are more legends in their own minds than in real life others like the lady bunny who founded the wigstock drag festival and jayne county the punk rock transsexual who claims to be the first rock act to play at cbgb the nightclub where punk first flourished in the 1970 's are genuine underground legends whose sheer endurance on the scene ensures at least a footnote in the history of the city 's bohemian culture instead of viewing this world as a cultural sideshow the movie is genuinely curious about its subjects lives and points of view as well appreciative of their provocative carefully groomed images in interviewing the performers the film which opens today at the den of cin at two boots video 44 avenue a at east third street east village moves from topic to topic the question how would you change new york yields answers that range from free subways to the return of rent control along with many complaints about the giuliani administration 's rigorous enforcement of the city 's cabaret laws the performers are especially revealing when describing how liberating it feels to put on an outrageous costume swab your face with makeup and become a character of your own invention among the film 's more invigorating performances are a bluntly obscene and funny bump and grind number by ms county a swath of slick fashion oriented pop by donovan leitch jason nesmith and their band nancy boy kembra phaler and her wittily allusive rock fright show the voluptuous horror of karen black and dean johnson and his band the velvet mafia sneering an insinuating anthem about male prostitution this is real unvarnished downtown new york culture tough defiant and proud and presented without a trace of the leering condescension that is often lavished on the scene in a spirit of exploitation stephen holden
