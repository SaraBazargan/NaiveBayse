 the miranda warning that staple of late night cop shows has been under attack from right wing lawyers who say that informing suspects of their rights makes it too hard to get convictions yesterday the supreme court agreed to take a missouri case that could scale back the effectiveness of miranda warnings at issue is a two step form of questioning which missouri 's highest court called an end run around miranda the supreme court should hold that such interrogation violates the fifth amendment 's protection against self incrimination in miranda v arizona the 1966 landmark decision the supreme court held that suspects must be warned that they have the right to remain silent and to get legal representation before the police can question them in the decades since then miranda has worked well and has won support from law enforcement but some ultraconservatives eager to reverse what they perceive to be the liberal excesses of the 1960 's and 1970 's have tried to undo it the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit in richmond va the most conservative federal appeals court held in 1999 that miranda warnings were not constitutionally required but the supreme court reversed that decision thereby reaffirming its commitment to miranda the missouri case the court took yesterday however would permit the miranda holding to be dangerously narrowed the case involves the interrogation of a woman suspected of arson when she was arrested an officer questioned her without giving her a miranda warning after she confessed he turned on a tape recorder told her of her right not to incriminate herself and referred to her previous incriminating statements the police admitted that they used this two step interrogation technique routinely in the hope of getting suspects to confess first without knowing their rights and then confess a second time in a form that would be usable in court the missouri supreme court rightly threw out the woman 's conviction there has been one case in 1985 in which the united states supreme court allowed statements to be admitted into evidence even though the questioning began before miranda warnings were given in that case however the failure to give the warnings was inadvertent the case the court took yesterday involves a deliberate policy of duping suspects into incriminating themselves before telling them their rights the supreme court should hold that such interrogation a form of investigative trickery is coercive and unconstitutional
