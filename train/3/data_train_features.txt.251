 to the editor the un vote on iraq editorial oct 17 hails the unanimous security council resolution authorizing an american led multinational force in iraq as a big victory for the bush administration how you reach this conclusion puzzles me the united nations has offered no financial support nor has it committed to sending troops without such support we will continue to be stuck in the quagmire that is iraq costing us billions of dollars as well as the loss of american lives almost daily this is indeed a hollow victory philip birnbaum auburn ala oct 17 2003
