 more than 34 years ago a prosperous stockbroker named henry scharf parked his green corvette sting ray at kennedy airport on a spring evening boarded a flight to cincinnati under an assumed name and disappeared earlier in the day mr scharf who left a wife and young daughter behind at his home in weston conn testified before a federal grand jury in manhattan that was investigating a 7 million tax fraud scheme several months later mr scharf a 45 year old naturalized citizen who was born in vienna was indicted in absentia on charges that he had conspired to evade taxes on the sale of more than 50 million in foreign stocks three other men charged in the scheme were ultimately convicted and sentenced to federal prison in the days after mr scharf vanished in 1966 his wife filed a missing person 's report and about a year later the internal revenue service issued a wanted bulletin but as the years and decades passed the authorities lost interest in mr scharf and the tax case against him until now kentucky authorities are expected to announce today that dna tests on a body found last april in the sandy clay banks of the ohio river show that the body was that of mr scharf he had been shot once in the back of the head and buried in lime 25 to 35 years ago his skeletal remains had been exposed by flood waters that had eroded the river 's bank where he was buried near fort thomas ky the discovery made on a cool spring night by two 15 year old boys fishing in the river focused attention on a mystery that had been long forgotten and on a case with hints of organized crime and international financial intrigue the discovery also set in motion a modern detective tale an exhaustive investigation by the kentucky authorities who worked for months to learn the identity of the dead man when the remains were first examined the state forensic anthropologist dr emily a craig thought she was dealing with the body of a drifter or a homeless man because she thought a piece of dark blue polyester fabric found with the body was common work clothing but dr craig said in a telephone interview yesterday that she soon learned that the dead man was anything but ordinary despite the passage of time and tree roots that had grown through the skeleton and the clothes the sandy moist ground preserved a lot of material for the investigators the blue fabric it turned out was not from work clothes but from a tailored drip dry suit one that would have been considered out of style by 1970 dr craig was also able to determine that the man had worn knee high lightweight dress socks held in place with garters he had two gold money clips in his pocket one was engraved with the initials h s and a gold a t cross pen and pencil set that had been made between 1965 and 1970 it was still attached to the fabric of his white dress shirt but it was five rusted keys found near the upper part of the dead man 's trousers that led the forensic anthropologist and detective mike daly of the fort thomas police department to begin looking into mr scharf 's case dr craig said there was a 1964 nickel in his pocket and a bunch of keys that were all corroded together she said we used naval jelly wd 40 and good old elbow grease to clean and separate them markings of two locksmiths in fairfield county in connecticut prompted the authorities to seek media coverage in the area about the missing remains and an article in the connecticut post prompted a call to detective daly from a scharf family friend who told them about the missing broker as the investigators began to delve into the missing person 's case on mr scharf and learn about the tax fraud scheme they found that the similarities between their victim and the connecticut man were extraordinary dr craig said the height weight age and build of mr scharf matched a profile they had prepared based on dr craig 's analysis of the remains as did the initials on the money clip and the estimated time of the man 's death and the date of mr scharf 's disappearance while the investigators were unable to find mr scharf 's dental records and his military records burned years ago in a fire at an archive center in st louis they were able to contact his sister and take a dna sample which came back this week matching one taken from the remains dr craig said dr craig said it was an emotional time for mr scharf 's widow and daughter who can finally put their concerns to rest neither of them could be reached for comment as the authorities began reviewing the missing person 's file on mr scharf and the tax fraud case they learned that one old report filed at the time quoted an fbi agent as saying that some of mr scharf 's co defendants had definite connections in the underworld one investigator said some of the reports also had oblique references to ties between the tax case and the mafia and one reported that mr scharf had some connection to loan sharks in new york the investigator said at the same time while investigators have no idea why mr scharf flew to cincinnati the area near where his body was found had been an organized crime haven in the 1950 's and 1960 's when newport ky was a gambling center mr scharf whose case in 1966 was brought by robert m morgenthau who was then the united states attorney for manhattan had been a principal in two firms that had gone bankrupt and in an investment firm that had been barred from dealing securities in 1962 according to securities exchange commission records detective daly said that he was investigating the possibility that organized crime may have played a role in the killing but he said that was just one of several possible motives this is n't a case where we have a smoking gun he said we 've come a long way and there is still a long way to go hopefully someone will step forward that might have information that might be helpful
