 before you know it life just passed you up the man said you lose everything you lose your wife you lose your family you lose your friends but after seeing you go back and forth to jail over 10 15 20 years he added they just give up on you he was speaking of his personal war with heroin addiction a demon he had battled for decades and like the aging addicts described in a study appearing this month in the archives of general psychiatry the man in late middle age was intimately familiar with the addiction 's physical and social costs the study begun in the mid 1970 's by researchers at the university of california at los angeles followed male heroin addicts admitted to a court ordered drug treatment program in california in the early 1960 's the men were interviewed in 1974 and 1975 and again in the mid 1980 's the report presented the findings of a 33 year follow up carried out in 1996 and 1997 of the 581 men in the original study the researchers found 284 had died 216 percent from drug overdoses or from poisonings by adulterants added to the drug another 386 percent died from cancer or from heart or liver disease three died of aids homicides suicides or accidents killed 55 of them yet as disturbing as these numbers were the death rates were higher by several orders of magnitude than those for the general population the struggles of the men who were still living were equally troubling for example of the 242 subjects interviewed in the 33 year follow up at the time in their late 40 's to mid 60 's 405 percent reported using heroin within the last year and 207 percent tested positive for the drug in the urinalysis required for the study abuse of other illicit drugs was also frequent 194 percent had used cocaine in the last year 355 percent had used marijuana as was the use of nicotine and alcohol the striking thing for me is that a good proportion of this group continues using said dr yih ing hser an adjunct professor at ucla 's neuropsychiatric institute and the lead author of the study ordinarily she said you 'd think that when people are reaching old age that they can not continue to do the things they used to like hustling for drugs but that did n't happen among the men in the study who still used drugs health problems unemployment criminal involvement social isolation and broken family relationships were common as they were for a similar group of addicted men who took part in focus groups organized by the researchers some men in the study did manage to attain abstinence and the difference was striking when they came into the interview said dr christine grella also an adjunct professor at the neuropsychiatric institute and an author of the study they were well functioning and they looked good dr grella said those who continued to use did n't look good and they had many physical problems that were hard for them the study financed in part by the national institute on drug abuse found that even the men who achieved periods of abstinence were still vulnerable to relapse those who had abstained for at least five years were less likely to relapse but even in this group 25 percent resumed heroin use some after 15 years of abstinence and among those abstinent for more than five years many abused alcohol or other drugs the findings the researchers said make it clear that surmounting heroin addiction can be a long and circuitous process and that treatment programs need to take this into account most people think that those who go to treatment will be immediately cured she said but heroin is a difficult drug to kick and therefore treatment and recovery has to take incremental steps results from the 20 year follow up the researchers said showed that methadone maintenance therapy helped the men refrain from heroin use but only 10 percent of the subjects were enrolled in methadone maintenance in any given year many researchers believe that methadone maintenance therapy is an essential component of treatment but say that for a variety of reasons it is often not readily available to addicts many programs for example discontinue treatment if a client fails a drug test or can not meet the fee dr hser said that kind of barrier to treatment is partly responsible for the outcome we are seeing she said while several national studies have followed addicts over a period of years the ucla study is the first to track them over three decades
