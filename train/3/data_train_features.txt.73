 state department officials say they now have visas for the father of 6 year old elian gonzalez and five others and president fidel castro of cuba said the father could be ready to travel to the united states as early as tuesday the six visas could be issued tuesday morning to the father juan miguel gonzalez and 5 of the 28 cubans who had applied for the trip to the united states said james rubin a state department spokesman but exactly when mr gonzalez would arrive and how he would take custody of his son if he gets here were still very much in doubt this evening the cuban government wants to send a large delegation on the trip to retrieve the boy a group that includes a psychiatrist classmates of elian mr gonzalez 's cuban family and the president of the national assembly ricardo alarcon an adviser to mr castro the six visas that were granted were for elian 's father stepmother an infant half brother a cousin his pediatrician and his kindergarten teacher the other visas are still being considered american officials said the united states interest section in havana will be submitting a list of questions to the cuban government as it considers the other applications to travel to the united states with the boy 's father mr rubin said when asked why such a large delegation was necessary the father 's lawyer gregory b craig said he would not support every name on the list but that the pediatrician and family members made perfect sense if the delegation must wait several weeks for a decision in the courts mr craig said mr gonzalez was not willing to come alone and sit for nine weeks without his family but as the state department prepared the legal paperwork to allow the boy 's father into the united states it was still unclear exactly how a transfer of the boy either from elian 's miami relatives to federal officials or from the miami family to the father himself would be accomplished in the volatile atmosphere surrounding the standoff an official with the immigration and naturalization service said tonight that the agency would begin transferring custody of the boy from his great uncle in miami to his father but that that did not mean that immigration officials had immediate plans to take elian from the home where he has lived with relatives since november the immigration official said the agency did not want to add any trauma to the boy 's life in an already tense situation immigration officials had demanded that elian 's miami relatives sign a document by tuesday morning saying they would hand the boy over if they lost a court fight in the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit in atlanta in may to keep him if they did not sign it immigration officials said they would revoke the boy 's immigration status and begin the process of ultimately removing the boy from the home here which is guarded by cuban exiles who say they will not allow the government to take the child but today immigration officials dropped their demand to revoke elian 's status maria cardona a spokeswoman for the immigration and naturalization service said only that our goal is to reunite elian and his father the issue is not whether we will transfer elian to his father ms cardona said but when and how mr craig said the boy 's miami family was making this very very difficult for us but he said he expected the relatives here to agree perhaps as early as tonight to some kind of eventual transfer but with conditions in havana today mr castro and the boy 's father were the focus of a rally of about 3000 college students from the caribbean and latin america the students called for elian 's return we want elian down with the lie the students chanted mr castro has offered two proposals for handing over the child in one the delegation of 28 people would care for elian in washington as the custody battle is decided in the courts the boy 's miami relatives have said they will appeal the case to the united states supreme court if they lose in the appeals court in atlanta but if american officials are willing to hand the child over to him immediately the father said he would leave for the united states as early as tuesday now that his visa has cleared i do not want to talk to any kidnapper nor accept any condition mr gonzalez said but it is highly unlikely that any transfer would be quick and easy as about 100 demonstrators again gathered outside the boy 's house in little havana thousands more are on call to join them at a moment 's notice all swearing that they will never allow the boy to be taken from the home the boy 's miami relatives have said they do not want the child to be traumatized in any way but his great uncle lazaro gonzalez said last week that he would not bring the boy out of his home and that government officials would have to come in and get him late last week the boy 's miami relatives said that elian 's father was verbally abusive to him on the telephone and that he told the boy that his mother who drowned in a crossing with him from cuba in november was still alive they 're preposterous mr craig said of the accusations they have a close and loving relationship father and son he said it was a desperate 11th hour effort to try and paint the father as something he is not officials were quoted late this evening by the associated press as saying elian 's father and his family would stay at the home of fernando remirez chief of cuba 's diplomatic mission in washington mr remirez his wife and two children will leave their home in suburban maryland and go elsewhere to make room for the gonzalez family the officials said
