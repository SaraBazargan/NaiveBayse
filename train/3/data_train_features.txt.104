 two years ago tomorrow a little after 10 at night cliff schaefer of oak ridge got a phone call that carried the worst possible news for him and the best possible news for a stranger named bonnye spino who lived in brick township that ringing telephone began a story that continues to unfold one that shows how grief and good fortune sometimes intermingle how resilient people can carry on after tragedy and yet not forget the phone call alerted mr schaefer that his only son james a 27 year old with a passion for things that move on two wheels had been severely injured in a motorcycle accident near blairstown it quickly became evident that james would not survive cliff schaefer had never given much thought to organ donations who does who expects his child to die young but remarkably in this numbing moment he broached the subject with doctors his simple explanation two years later it was my desire to more or less try to turn it around bonnye spino needed a gesture like that she was just 55 but a bad heart was killing her my chest just kept filling up with fluid and i kept going into heart failure she said and so the day after the accident james was taken off life support and dr mark b anderson surgical director of the heart transplant program at robert wood johnson hospital in new brunswick put the young man 's heart into ms spino probably about 30 percent of the people on the waiting lists in this country die on a yearly basis waiting for their hearts dr anderson said several intertwining threads let ms spino beat those odds one perversely was james 's love of cycles the accident occurred as he was breaking in a new harley davidson that was his dream to have this harley his stepmother karin schaefer said he bought it that morning at 10 and he died on it that night another was ms spino 's decision to switch her care from a philadelphia hospital to a new jersey one dr anderson said many new jersey doctors having trained in philadelphia or new york refer their transplant patients to large medical centers there even though waiting times for an organ can be shorter in new jersey where robert wood johnson and newark beth israel do heart transplants if an organ is harvested in this state it comes to us first he said we 're only competing against ourselves james 's heart made ms spino a new person as she put it but the physical improvement had an emotional price she is not the type to want to benefit from another 's misfortune when i first received the heart i had a very hard time accepting it because i knew it was a young person she said i would wake up in the night and cry the schaefers meanwhile were having their own struggles including the question that nags many donor families did our child 's heart go to a good person so about a year after the operation the schaefers and ms spino took a step that dr anderson said remains unusual in the transplant world they met and now they 're good friends when ms spino became a great grandmother in april the schaefers were at the christening this month they shared a few days at the shore and they have done promotional work on behalf of organ donations she 's lovely ms schaefer said of the woman who has her stepson 's heart we all get along so nicely and jimmy lives on the schaefers know that meeting the organ recipient might not be comfortable for every donor family but it was for them it just confirmed that we did the right thing ms schaefer said now at the two year mark everyone involved can take stock ms spino has used her gift of more time to enjoy her family to reach out to others in her situation and in general to savor each moment before i was very conservative she said now i push myself because i do n't want to miss out on anything and mr schaefer has used ms spino 's rejuvenation not to erase his loss but to help cope with it i could never replace my son and no one who i could ever be involved with through this thing could replace him he said but bonnye has been terrific her family 's terrific for me to be able to sit there and look at these people and realize that she 's had the opportunity to go on it does me a lot of good remembrance and rebuilding proceeding together a lesson with resonance as another two year anniversary approaches
