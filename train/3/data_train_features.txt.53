 winter has dropped like a curtain over the east end of long island the highways are jitney free the summer homes battened shut and the roadside clam shacks closed till next season but even now the beaches are not exactly bare one afternoon this month a dozen surfers paddled through the churning atlantic off the island 's eastern tip sure it had snowed the night before and the wind and water were cold enough to numb their fingers and chap their faces but hey just look at those breakers new york 's die hard surfers endure tepid swells and crowded beaches all summer long and winter is their reward the amateurs have abandoned the shores and the icy winds whip the atlantic into an all you can eat buffet of 10  and 15 foot waves there is plenty of parking and there is rarely an audience if you change out of your wet suit in the middle of a parking lot and so small cadres of friends are slipping on their black neoprene wet suits and paddling into the icy stew at atlantic beach long beach montauk and other places their ranks are small and male dominated but surf shop owners said that more people were taking up winter surfing as wet suits become lighter cheaper and better at sealing in body heat it 's a segment of the sport that is growing tremendously said rick wright who owns rick 's action sports a surfing store in east islip that is open all year a few years ago he said you 'd go down to the beach and pray that somebody was there now there 's 20 to 30 people down there so as these things often go the true die hards seek ever more perilous thrills some winter surfers seek out waves in the antarctic or off the coast of iceland while others reminisce about the days when their wet suits leaked like sieves today 's standard uniform is simple and enough to keep most surfers from developing hypothermia they wear a black full body wet suit a black rubber hood and black waterproof gloves and boots which cost a total of about 500 on that post snowstorm december day the dozen surfers at montauk point were suited up and resembled oil slicked seals as they paddled into the ocean gusting winds blew curlicues of spume off the top of the waves the surfers lay prone on their boards until a wave rolled in and swept them away they stood and sluiced across the water until the waves curled over them dumping gallons of 40 degree water on their heads you 're cold forever leif neubauer said after swimming ashore they surf in sleet and snow when the temperature dips below freezing and ice floes bob alongside them but even on a comparatively mild december day the ocean was cold enough to take the breath away several surfers said they could stay in the water for up to four hours even as their eyelashes turned to tiny icicles although their faces chap and they lose feeling in their jaw they said they swim around enough to stay warm and if the water is truly freezing mr abruzzi said they sometimes urinate in their wet suits he likened the experience to taking a shot of warm whiskey of course there are risks the wind and waves are fierce and unpredictable in the winter and the cold drains a surfer 's energy bringing on muscle fatigue and cotton minded dizziness winter is brutal said chris harmon a longtime surfer you 're out there all on your own you get hurt and you can only look back at the ocean and mumble occasionally a neophyte or a surfer with a flimsy suit will tire and need to be pulled to shore but no one could remember a death brought on strictly by the cold over the years some die hards develop surfer 's ear a condition in which bone builds up in the ear canal after prolonged exposure to cold water tom piacentine a longtime winter surfer on long island said he had undergone three operations to scrape the buildup from his ear morning and night the surfers monitor the weather and check the wave reports 631 537 surf to see how the ocean will behave if there are waves they call a few friends and head for the beach after a few hours when they 're numb nauseated and drained they lurch from the water and head for their cars and a heater your muscles are all just spent said mike ahearn 18 you want to eat a lot drink a beer or two and then go to sleep
