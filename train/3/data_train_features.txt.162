 the director shekhar kapur 's remake of the four feathers is a tepid shallow tributary of larger deeper bodies of waters like the historical revisionist film dramas last of the mohicans which was also a remake and little big man heath ledger stars as harry feversham an officer in queen victoria 's army full of mellow bonhomie and a cheeky modesty in the late 1800 's he and his unit are in training in the british army and feathers gives us a protracted and reverent look at their life harry and his best pal jack durrance wes bentley wearing a silly smirk that suggests he ca n't believe he 's being paid for his bad british accent are mad over ethne ethne is played by kate hudson who seems to have been hired for balance she possesses the one mock english accent worse than mr bentley 's but ethne is wild about harry when the friends unit is assigned to fight in sudan harry is overcome with fear at the prospect of battle jack and their fellow officers greet harry 's plight as a game that he is playing and since harry makes such a grandiloquent display of it and it 's filmed with wide screen splendor so that every twitch of his lachrymal glands seems visible we think so as well that is until harry resigns his commission drawing disdain from his father the general tim pigott smith who 's playing the same exemplar of british priggishness he displayed in jewel in the crown harry is given a white feather by four of his friends a public repudiation what do you do if you 're branded a coward and you know you 're a man in harry 's case it means you pack off to sudan wear a phony beard and join the natives in their battle harry could n't fool a distracted 4 year old but in one of the film 's many instances of absurdity he goes native and somehow suckers the africans his mission is to rescue his friends who quickly discover that they 're in way over their regiment this director would appear to be an ideal candidate to oversee a remake of feathers with his penchant for showing how personal politics fit into institutional cruelty as he did so elegantly in elizabeth and the bandit queen but feathers so grandly plays out the imperialist fraternity of the british army that it 's as if mr kapur were making a commercial for a way of life that no one misses if he wants to underscore the macho superficiality of the traditions the point could have been made much faster but the spectacle of clubby empty headed good cheer is so lovingly protracted this section takes up almost the first 20 minutes that we feel as if we 're trapped reading a tribute to someone who few people particularly care about it 's the kind of wrongheadedness that can make one reflect kindly back on the schoolyard testosterone antics of young guns a wild west drama with a superficial historical perspective the casting of feathers which opens today nationwide is along the same lines as guns the good humored mr ledger crunches his eyes into a pained crinkle at this point in his career he 's the wrong actor for this kind of thing his welterweight misery seems even punier when djimon hounsou makes his entrance as abou the requisite buffed sidekick abou barely lifts his eyelids past half staff when hearing of harry 's desperation to prove himself and his courage it 's embarrassing to treat abou as someone incapable of understanding loyalty especially when we know he 'll eventually come around to assisting harry in his struggle and of course wander off into the distance mr hounsou with his pride in movement and dogged confidence is the kind of handy presence the picture could use more of his eccentric pauses and laughs suggest a modern day version of ralph richardson one of the stars of the 1939 feathers and with its jumps from past to present the movie could use ballast an extended flashback just when it feels as if feathers should be ending will probably produce a number of heavy sighs from the audience the ragged condescension toward the natives which includes such exquisite exotica as the fashion model alek wek as a slave who saves harry 's life for a moment of kindness is the kind of tired patronizing that you 'd hope mr kapur could shove the four feathers past instead he is shackled to epic by the yard filmmaking on the other hand one of the most immediate and shocking benefits of his direction is the action sequences most notably one set piece in which an apparent victory immediately segues into a slaughter with angles filmed from a vulture 's eye view by the cinematographer robert richardson but such few assets are n't enough to alleviate the film 's shallowness the picture 's wheezing fussiness and devotion to the british empire and its minor nods to questioning unthinking loyalty to an ideal make the four feathers a possible first of a kind a movie that 's halfhearted about ambivalence the four feathers is rated pg 13 parents strongly cautioned for violence action some bloodshed and several scenes of single malt
