 to the editor modern classical music is in such a sorry state because it is produced largely by people who can make a living without pleasing their audiences if a manufacturer painter sculptor or filmmaker produces goods that people wo n't buy they go out of business but not modern composers they receive commissions from opera companies and symphony orchestras guilt ridden for not being more involved in contemporary music and hold down comfortable academic positions guilt ridden audiences put up with listening to the works once but rarely enjoy the process so what 's to be done give up on new music or force it down throats of course not let 's try the market the way all the other arts do anthony tommasini did not even mention the only two serious american composers who make a living composing and who perform to sell out audiences of mixed ages philip glass and steve reich if contemporary music is to have a chance its distributors ie the performers must be more discriminating they must determine which new works the audience enjoys the most just as other distributors do they must stop playing the modern music they like and start performing what audiences like not schoenberg 's 12 tone trivia but the dances of glass and if these composers sink from favor as most of them will scrap them too robert w wilson manhattan the writer is a former chairman of the new york city opera
