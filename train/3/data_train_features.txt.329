 president bush and gov gray davis who are deeply at odds on california 's energy problems have one thing in common plunging approval ratings among california 's aggrieved voters yesterday 's meeting between the two did little to bridge the gap on energy and may have done even less to improve their political fortunes as expected mr davis asked mr bush for federal price caps on the soaring cost of wholesale electricity and threatened to sue the federal government if the caps were not forthcoming according to state estimates california paid 7 billion for electricity in 1999 and may pay 10 times that amount this year but mr bush refused repeating his view that caps will make california 's problems worse in the long run by discouraging new investments in power plants for mr davis the issue is partly political he is up for re election next year and still has designs on the democratic presidential nomination but he hurt himself by moving too slowly to raise rates on consumers and businesses a move rightly urged by the administration to encourage conservation and he was unlucky enough to be governor at a time when the state began suffering the effects of a grievously flawed deregulation plan mr bush for his part may be able to get along without california but it is not clear that his party can only one statewide elected official is a republican and california democrats have targeted several republican members of congress whose defeat in 2002 could weaken if not end republican control over the house of representatives the bush forces say they have done plenty for california including expediting federal permits for new plants and ordering conservation measures at federal facilities but nothing would help more than a temporary cap on wholesale electricity prices like the one envisaged in a bill sponsored by senators dianne feinstein of california and gordon smith of oregon it would ease the drain on california 's treasury release electricity that is currently being withheld in expectation of higher prices and address the administration 's fears about investment by guaranteeing producers a reasonable profit mr bush stubbornly clings to his position that this is essentially california 's problem not washington 's but if the problem ripples beyond california 's borders that stubbornness could cost him support in the nation at large
