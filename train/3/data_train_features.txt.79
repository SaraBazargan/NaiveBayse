 given the course of british knighthood it 's probably no surprise to learn that mick jagger has been newly dubbed sir mick jagger but it does provoke a certain sadness there was a sir ness to sir paul mccartney long before it became official an acknowledgment of how much music hall as well as beatle there was in him even if there was never as much difference between the beatles and the rolling stones as we liked to believe they at least stood for different tensions within rock 'n roll the difference between the rebellion implicit in a kind of musical ecstasy and rebellion as actual insurrection the premise of the rolling stones was that you could n't contain them that has long since ceased to be true and sir mick proves it when asked about the anti establishment stance of the early stones sir mick according to reuters said i do n't really think the establishment as we knew it exists any more this is the sort of thing one says when one has long since become part of the establishment but he 's right of course there is n't the sense of a punitive establishment trying to squash the expression of young people if they choose to seek it in the trappings of cultural rebels why squash it when you can own it but there 's no point blaming sir mick he was working within a cultural system the recording industry that had been co opted from the start but just think of all those promises the young devils made never to grow old or to stop playing rock 'n roll long before they did as the old devils get even older their young selves look less devilish
