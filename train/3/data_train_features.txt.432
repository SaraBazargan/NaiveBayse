 ariel sharon 's decisive electoral victory yesterday marks a sharp turn in israeli policies just 21 months after voting in ehud barak who promised to accelerate peace negotiations with the palestinians and syria israeli voters have chosen one of the country 's most unyielding politicians as prime minister mr sharon will now need to show that he can combine his customary toughness with enough flexibility to avoid aggravating an already combustible situation in israel and across the middle east in a conciliatory move last night mr sharon renewed his invitation to mr barak 's labor party to join him in a broad national unity government labor should accept the election culminates an improbable comeback by mr sharon as defense minister in 1982 he directed israel 's ill advised invasion of lebanon in an episode that nearly ended his career an official israeli panel found him indirectly responsible for atrocities committed by israel 's christian phalangist allies in palestinian refugee camps but mr sharon recovered and after the former prime minister benjamin netanyahu retired temporarily from politics mr sharon succeeded him as the likud leader his staged walk across jerusalem 's bitterly contested temple mount lighted the spark for more than four months of palestinian violence during the election campaign mr sharon suggested that he would break off further negotiations with the palestinians pending a complete end to the violence and then propose a settlement offering them roughly the territory they already control some 42 percent of the west bank and almost 90 percent of the gaza strip that was politically popular among israelis but it is not a realistic long term formula for peace just as richard nixon 's lifelong anti communist views allowed him to defrost relations with china mr sharon 's conservative credentials give him the latitude to try more creative approaches to the palestinians mr sharon has good reason to seek a unity government it would be difficult to assemble a stable governing majority if he limits himself to his own likud party and other right wing and religious groupings by accepting his offer labor may be able to exert a moderating influence washington should counsel the new government to maintain a steady course and avoid the impulse to escalate military confrontations with the palestinians israel can not afford to abandon the search for peace in the middle east that has lasted more than two decades despite his defeat mr barak deserves credit for his energetic pursuit of peace yasir arafat unwisely spurned mr barak 's proposals and then encouraged a palestinian uprising against israel that revolt doomed mr barak 's peace policy and assured mr sharon 's electoral triumph
