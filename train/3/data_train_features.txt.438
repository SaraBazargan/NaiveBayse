 ethan cohen fine arts 37 walker street tribeca through may 19 the beijing based artist qiu zhijie a catalytic figure in chinese vanguard art made a memorable contribution to the asia society 's exhibition inside out new chinese art in 1997 with a conceptual piece titled writing 'the orchid pavilion one thousand times the preface to the orchid pavilion collection composed in the fourth century is a touchstone of chinese calligraphy one that every practitioner tries to master through repetition mr qiu copied it a thousand times between 1986 to 1997 but always on the same sheet of paper as the layered words dissolved into a solid field of black ink a revered cultural icon was perpetuated and obliterated in a further twist the artist videotaped his writing sessions reducing the ideal of spontaneous emotion generated virtuosity so essential to calligraphy 's mystique to a permanent and prosaic record of labor intensive effort much of the work in the cohen show which marks the artist 's new york solo debut similarly plays with and extends classical forms calligraphic hanging scrolls traditionally vehicles for poetry carry outtakes from the chinese dictionary on other scrolls pictorial components of ink and brush landscapes trees figures pavilions are detached from their original contexts in a video mr qiu writes out tang dynasty poems but the tape is played backward so that he appears to be erasing them to insure that this unwriting moves in proper right to left sequence he wrote the poems backward for the film a virtuosic feat in itself also on view are the traces of a piece the artist executed in the gallery during his recent new york stay on a daily schedule he rubbed together the engraved surfaces of two tombstones one chinese and more than 1000 years old the other american from the early 20th century and never actually used during weeks of work the inscriptions were gradually obliterated and the identities they commemorated separated by time and culture mingled together as a pile of dust at this point mr qiu is moving in many directions at once he has an interactive digital piece in the show last month he organized and participated in an exhibition of installation based performance work in beijing and because much of his art is language based and therefore difficult for non chinese audiences to approach it tends to look both low key and diffuse in fact certain themes cultural fragmentation transiency and attitudes brash zen style wit tempered nostalgia are constants and mr qiu is only 32 there 's still plenty of time for him to follow loose ends wherever they lead holland cotter
