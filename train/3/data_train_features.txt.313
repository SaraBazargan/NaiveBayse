 parents who smoke may be encouraging their children to try smoking by asking them to do things like lighting their cigarettes or cleaning out their ashtrays researchers reported yesterday a study that looked at the children for a year concluded that they were at a minimum more likely to experiment with tobacco the lead author dr rafael laniado laborin told a conference of american college of chest physicians in san diego the researchers surveyed 3624 seventh and eighth graders in san diego asking them about their smoking patterns if any and whether their parents engaged in what the study refers to as smoking prompts these include having the children light the cigarettes for the parents sometimes in a child 's mouth take cigarettes to the parents or go to the store and buy them the study then focused on 292 parents who smoked and their children when the children were interviewed a year later those whose parents gave them prompts were more likely to have tried cigarettes dr laniado laborin said the study also found that many parents were not aware of what they were doing when asked for example whether they had their children bring them cigarettes 25 percent said yes but when their children answered the question the figure was 59 percent just under 9 percent of the parents said their children cleaned their ashtrays almost half the children said they did so children whose parents smoke are already known to be more likely to try smoking when children have easy access to cigarettes the risk increases dr laniado laborin said
