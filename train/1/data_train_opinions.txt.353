 to the editor re a reduction in music is considered at wnyc arts pages feb 28 new york city cultural capital of the western world may soon be reduced to having only one classical music radio station to a lifetime daily listener and longtime member of wnyc fm it is heartbreaking to hear that the station may continue what the terrorists began with the destruction of the transmitters and put more endless talk on the fm airwaves in the place of great music as a veteran of the lost fight to save another fine classical station wncn many years ago i am not optimistic about our chances this time the amount of music on wnyc had already eroded in the last few years and the encroachment of pop culture has become ever more pervasive having already retuned my dial i wo n't find it hard to also drop my membership but first i hope my fellow music lovers will plead to return the talk to wnyc am and save our daytime classical fm station katharine flanders mukherji brooklyn feb 28 2002
