 when the european commission indicated it was likely to block the proposed merger between general electric and honeywell american politicians from george w bush on down cried foul with some alleging that the decision was politically motivated they 're almost certainly wrong about that but it is true that the ec 's case against the merger is far from watertight mario monti europe 's competition referee may have made a bad call on this play nonetheless our politicians should lower their voices mr monti is one of the good guys in today 's global economy he should not be made the target of attempts at political intimidation to put the ge honeywell affair in context you need to realize that this case is a triple switcheroo it contradicts not one but three pieces of conventional wisdom first the conventional view is that globalization weakens governments because it forces them to compete for private investment broadly speaking this view is right conventional wisdom usually is there are however exceptions to the rule and antitrust policy is one of those exceptions in today 's world no company can compete effectively unless it can operate freely on both sides of the atlantic which it can do only with a green light from antitrust authorities in both the united states and europe the result is that instead of eroding the power of those authorities globalization has extended their reach american regulators can block european mergers and vice versa second this case inverts traditional roles until recently only the us seemed to take antitrust policy seriously europeans might have us style legislation on the books but they often seemed to feel that cartels like extramarital affairs were nothing to worry about as long as the participants were discreet and they were scornful toward puritanical americans who insisted on enforcing the letter of the law lately however europe has gotten serious about antitrust giving the competition commissioner broad powers to block mergers and investigate allegations of anticompetitive behavior mr monti an american trained university professor who assumed that office in 1999 has used those powers aggressively general electric and honeywell are by no means the first companies to find mr monti blocking what they thought was a done deal was mr monti right to block this particular deal it 's a complicated issue let 's just say that the case against this merger is similar to the case for breaking up microsoft though it seems a lot weaker on the other hand you do n't need as strong an argument to block a merger as you do to break up a going concern we 're in a gray area with the precise shade of gray a matter of opinion even if you disagree with mr monti 's opinion however his sincerity is not in doubt the best answer to those who claim that this is really a protectionist ploy is mr monti 's track record he has repeatedly shown himself willing to oppose the demands of powerful european interest groups why would he suddenly become a tool of protectionists and that leads us to the third switcheroo europeans are accustomed to cozy cohabitation between politicians and businessmen americans tend to insist on at least the appearance of an arms length relationship but just at the moment when the europeans have placed competition policy in the hands of a sternly upright professor the united states has acquired an administration that seems oblivious to normal concerns about conflict of interest it 's not yet clear whether the bush administration really is a government of by and for big corporations to an extent not seen since warren g harding was president or whether it just looks that way but the stories keep accumulating intel 's chief lobbyist says that his highly inappropriate meetings with karl rove were quite useful to its merger case and mr rove did n't even get a slap on the wrist according to the outgoing chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission the head of enron offered to support him at the white house if he changed his policy positions and it took three months and a sharp prod from jake tapper at salon before treasury secretary paul o'neill honored his promise to sell his alcoa stock as a consumer i 'm not sure i trust these people to protect me from the market power of giant corporations and so it 's nice to know that mr monti is out there looking after my interests
