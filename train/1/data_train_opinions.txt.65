 to the editor re homage to balanchine column july 14 anthony lewis is right art can indeed rise above the pettiness and politics of any particular age i was a member of the new york city ballet when the company danced in the soviet union in 1962 a memory i shall cherish forever it was smack in the middle of the cuban missile crisis but the audiences were among the most enthusiastic we 'd ever encountered the more avant garde the ballet the more wildly they cheered george balanchine 's artistic genius did indeed transcend politics mr balanchine deliberately refrained from including stars and stripes in the tour because he feared that the ballet might be misunderstood as a political statement when we did perform the ballet in 1965 in paris as the huge american flag backdrop slowly unfurled at the end there were loud boos from the audience afterward i happened to be standing next to mr b in the wings when someone suggested that we cancel any remaining stars and stripes and replace it with another ballet mr b forever feisty replied emphatically never tomorrow more flag maybe fireworks ellen shire new york july 14 2001
