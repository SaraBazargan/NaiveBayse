 carol browner who has made air pollution her signature issue during eight years as administrator of the environmental protection agency is ending her tenure with a ruling that will make the air in cities like new york much cleaner and healthier than it is today under a timetable announced last week by ms browner and approved by president clinton big diesel powered vehicles like trucks and buses will be subject to new rules that are intended to reduce emissions of soot and smog producing pollutants by 90 percent over time environmentalists described the plan as the biggest step forward for cleaner air since the removal of lead from gasoline in the 1970 's the linchpin of the strategy is a rule requiring refiners to reduce the sulfur content in diesel fuel by 97 percent that is crucial because sulfur not only produces soot but clogs up a vehicle 's catalytic converter the device that removes other pollutants with nearly sulfur free fuel manufacturers of diesel engines will be able to incorporate the sophisticated pollution control devices that are now standard equipment in ordinary cars the cleaner fuel will also allow the retrofitting of existing diesel engines resulting in some short term benefits even as the trucks and buses now on the road are phased out over time the benefits should be substantial buses and heavy duty trucks ranging in size from delivery vehicles to 18 wheelers account for just 6 percent of all miles driven in the united states but they produce one fourth of the smog producing chemicals in the nation and up to half the soot in cities like new york where the health benefits will be greatest last spring after years of pressure from health groups and environmental advocates new york city announced that it would begin to convert its bus fleet to natural gas or hybrid electric vehicles that conversion will continue because it offers immediate benefits whereas the national program will take time to implement fully during intense negotiations with ms browner industry representatives warned that the costs of producing the cleaner fuel would be so onerous that some refiners might stop producing diesel fuel altogether but administration officials and even some big producers including british petroleum reject this gloomy assessment in part because the rules give refiners ample lead time about 80 percent of all diesel fuel must be virtually sulfur free by 2006 the rest by 2010 the administration also argued that the public health benefits including reduced rates of cancer asthma and other diseases would outweigh the projected costs the epa has pegged this extra expense at only 1200 to 1900 apiece for cleaner engines in big vehicles that can cost up to 250000 cleaner diesel fuel would cost an extra four to six cents a gallon the epa estimates industry sources put the extra fuel costs at three times that amount but it is worth noting that ever since the original clean air act was written into law in 1970 industry in general has regularly overestimated the costs of environmental rules while underestimating the ability of its own engineers to satisfy those rules in a timely cost effective way ms browner is betting that improved technology can deliver cleaner fuels and cleaner vehicles at affordable prices historically that has been a safe bet of course president elect george w bush could order his new epa administrator gov christie whitman to overturn the new regulations some of mr bush 's friends in the oil industry may well ask him to do so but that would require him to begin the laborious process of drafting regulations all over again it would also demonstrate an amazing indifference to the public 's demonstrated desire for cleaner air
