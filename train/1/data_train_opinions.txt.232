 to the editor your april 11 editorial in which you assert that the supreme court 's proceedings should be televised neglects the fact that the court was designed to be insulated from public opinion preventing its proceedings from being televised is an important protection because the effectiveness of the court relies on the justices insulation from public pressure other branches of the government must worry about public opinion but the supreme court is the one that follows only the law it should not have to worry about anything else clay davis springfield ohio april 11 2000
