 to the editor in debate this column sept 19 thomas l friedman discusses several important current foreign affairs issues and then bemoans the likelihood that both george w bush and al gore will get by without discussing any of them in the coming debates certainly history supports his gloomy prediction population is another issue that will loom over the debates in silence between john glenn 's first trip into space and his recent return visit the world 's population doubled yet this stunning and worrying growth continues to go unnoticed by our society the world 's expanding population and the destruction of the world 's environment are probably the two great issues of the new century but like mr friedman i doubt that any of these issues will be meaningfully addressed in the debates gordon douglas pawling ny sept 19 2000
