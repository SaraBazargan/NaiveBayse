 to the editor re strain of fourth grade tests drives off veteran teachers front page june 14 i became a teacher to inspire the creativity in my students and promote the development of lifelong learners i also encourage my students to be individual thinkers and focus on process over product there may be only one answer sometimes but it is the process of getting to a goal whether correct or not that is the most important i feel that these tests are damaging to the theme of process over product it seems that the product or test scores are now more important than the way children use their thinking skills or creativity good teachers can not follow a script the only script in the classroom is what energizes students and turns them on to learning the more pressure placed on a teacher to produce a perfect product or test score the fewer creative process oriented teachers you will have and the even fewer creative thinkers as students what will become of lifelong learners tova markowitz lynbrook ny june 14 2001
