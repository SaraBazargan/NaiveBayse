 to the editor last saturday night flying into newark airport sitting next to a texan who had never seen manhattan before i said just look down to the end of the island where the bright white lights are that 's the former world trade center site she fell silent in reverent memory somehow the footprints of both towers must be preserved so that people can remember all that sept 11 has meant only the plans for memorial plaza and memorial square achieve that goal and as you say editorial july 17 they seemed the least imaginative of all it 's good that the lower manhattan development corporation says it is willing to consider other plans that way a fitting and spectacular memorial can be lower manhattan 's legacy to the world rev lee alison crawford northfield vt july 17 2002
