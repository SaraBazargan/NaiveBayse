 to the editor re new twist on physicist 's role in nazi bomb front page feb 7 the release of the werner heisenberg niels bohr correspondence will not i fear make much of a dent in the carapace of denial that surrounds the whole question of heisenberg 's role in the german atomic bomb project and his moral conduct during the nazi era already as your article indicates the wagons are circling and preparing to say that bohr got it all wrong about his old friend that in any case heisenberg was in a difficult position and if that does n't wash that the letters from bohr are at bottom quite ambiguous unfortunately the documentary evidence in my book heisenberg and the nazi atomic bomb project showing heisenberg 's errors in his physical equations and formulas about the bomb as well as the extent of his collaboration with the nazi regime has failed to convince the apologists for heisenberg among these is michael frayn the author of copenhagen who expended much effort in trying to refute such arguments in the postscript to the printed edition of his play to quote ronald fraser the british intelligence officer in charge of heisenberg 's rehabilitation after the war all this denial and rationalization are rather pitiful in a man of heisenberg 's mental stature but there are now too many reputations tied up with the matter for any objective resolution of the issue paul lawrence rose state college pa feb 7 2002
