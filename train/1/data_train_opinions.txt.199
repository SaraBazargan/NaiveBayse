 the white house has thrown its weight behind an effort to save the nomination of charles pickering to a federal appeals court senator orrin hatch denounced opposition to judge pickering as a lynching last week and he forced the postponement of a judiciary committee decision when the nomination appeared doomed to go down on a party line vote perhaps mr hatch and other conservative republicans worry that if judge pickering is rejected president bush will be forced to reconsider his strategy of using seats on federal courts as a sop to the right wing we can only hope that would be so unfortunately there are a lot of other disappointing nominees where judge pickering came from the bush administration has 53 judicial nominations pending in the senate some even more troubling than this one there is a danger that despite the republicans record of blockading well qualified moderate judicial nominees during the clinton administration democrats in the senate will become tired of being called obstructionist and give way there is too much at stake for that to happen while attention to judicial nominations usually focuses on the supreme court few who go to the courts seeking justice get that far the supreme court docket has been shrinking and is now roughly 85 cases a year lately the justices have stayed on the sidelines in many of the most contentious legal battles like california 's ban on affirmative action by state agencies and the microsoft antitrust litigation as a result the federal appellate courts one step below the supreme court have never been more influential judges on the 13 circuit courts of appeal are continually issuing decisions in cases involving everything from employment discrimination to the environment and abortion that often become the last word on our rights as americans as the struggle over federal court nominees goes on it is critical that rather than focusing on personalities senators define what qualifies someone to be a federal judge and what minimum standards they will apply to the president 's choices first and foremost the senate should make clear that it will accept only nominees for federal judgeships who are well qualified by education and experience the federal bench especially at the appellate level is no place for on the job training second there should be no significant question about a nominee 's ethics particularly as they affect performance on the bench senators also have an obligation to consider a nominee 's judicial philosophy and ideology the president has a right within reasonable bounds to name individuals whose philosophy he finds compatible but the senate has a duty to reject anyone whose views are outside the modern mainstream judgeships are lifetime appointments every nominee should be devoted to freedom of speech and the guarantees in the bill of rights sensitive to the civil rights of women and minorities and respectful of congress 's constitutional power to safeguard those rights and the environment if the senators adhere honestly to those criteria it is likely that they will find a number of the bush administration 's current crop of nominees unacceptable senators must then find the courage and the energy to reject the nominations if anyone becomes defensive about the president 's inability to get his judicial picks confirmed it should be mr bush
