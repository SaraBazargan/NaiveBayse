 in his acceptance speech al gore came across as earnest and knowledgeable he did not descend into discomfiting sentiment as he did twice before and he overcame his habit of speaking in slow condescension his was a meat and potatoes populist speech gore 's i will not let you down separated him from the president who did similar criticism of the poll driven clinton could be inferred from sometimes you have to be willing to spend your popularity in order to pick the hard right over the easy wrong moreover gore 's device of audience involvement worked well he dramatized welfare reform subsidized drugs for seniors federal subsidy for local schools and ire at hmo 's by focusing on individual faces adding impact to the television coverage asserting his own manmanship gore wrote the speech himself but to break from banality that speech needed a rewrite fancy oratory is not eloquence but original expression makes an address memorable and a decent respect for rhetoric is needed to do justice to history consider his feeble attempt to build upon john kennedy 's thematic signature which 40 years before had transfixed the audience in that venue from this city that marked both the end of america 's journey westward and the beginning of the new frontier said gore let us set out on a new journey to the best america a new journey on which we advance not by the turning of wheels but by the turning of our minds turning from what toward what tentatively trying out the new journey as his slogan gore stumbled at the first step contrast his labored mechanical metaphor of wagon wheels grinding westward with the fresh and beautiful evocation of the frontier theme by his running mate the night before we may wonder where the next frontier really is joe lieberman said tonight i believe that the next frontier is n't just in front of us but inside of us to overcome the differences that are still between us to break down the barriers that remain you can find plain metaphorical nourishment in his phrase is n't just in front of us but inside of us gore 's fake apology sometimes people say i 'm too serious that i talk too much substance and policy reminded me of nixon 's some of my advisers have suggested i take the easy way as a white house speechwriter i often advised take the easy way so i could submit a draft in which nixon could say he rejected that counsel when gore tried to make a phrase he demonstrated his need for editorial improvement in this city of angels he offered in a lame peroration we can summon the better angels of our nature that was merely a play on words and a few remembered that in 1988 vice president george bush said that prosperity 's purpose was to allow us to pursue our better angels but let 's see what a great rewriter once did with that same figure of speech as civil war loomed william seward named by lincoln to be secretary of state suggested lines for the end of the first inaugural address i close we are not we must not be aliens or enemies but fellow countrymen and brethren lincoln rewrote i am loath to close we are not enemies but friends the mystic chords suggested seward which proceeding from so many battlefields and so many patriot graves pass through all the hearts and hearths in the broad continent of ours will yet again harmonize in their ancient music when breathed upon by the guardian angel of our nation lincoln in his rewrite of this passage transformed seward 's musical metaphor from oratory to poetry by changing not only its cadence but the source of the heavenly intervention the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as they surely will be by the better angels of our nature to be your own man does not require that you be your own sole writer creative revision by another pair of eyes helps a speech rise to a great occasion gore should remember lincoln 's collaborative peroration as he dreams of his own inaugural address
