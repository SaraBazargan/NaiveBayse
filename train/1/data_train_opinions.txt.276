 why do n't people vote their own self interest every few years the republicans propose a tax cut and every few years the democrats pull out their income distribution charts to show that much of the benefits of the republican plan go to the richest 1 percent of americans or thereabouts and yet every few years a republican plan wends its way through the legislative process and with some trims and amendments passes the democrats could n't even persuade people to oppose the repeal of the estate tax which is explicitly for the mega upper class al gore who ran a populist campaign could n't even win the votes of white males who did n't go to college whose incomes have stagnated over the past decades and who were the explicit targets of his campaign why do n't more americans want to distribute more wealth down to people like themselves well as the academics would say it 's overdetermined there are several reasons people vote their aspirations the most telling polling result from the 2000 election was from a time magazine survey that asked people if they are in the top 1 percent of earners nineteen percent of americans say they are in the richest 1 percent and a further 20 percent expect to be someday so right away you have 39 percent of americans who thought that when mr gore savaged a plan that favored the top 1 percent he was taking a direct shot at them it 's not hard to see why they think this way americans live in a culture of abundance they have always had a sense that great opportunities lie just over the horizon in the next valley with the next job or the next big thing none of us is really poor we 're just pre rich americans read magazines for people more affluent than they are w cigar aficionado the new yorker robb report town and country because they think that someday they could be that guy with the tastefully appointed horse farm democratic politicians proposing to take from the rich are just bashing the dreams of our imminent selves income resentment is not a strong emotion in much of america if you earn 125000 a year and live in manhattan certainly you are surrounded by things you can not afford you have to walk by those buildings on central park west with the 2500 square foot apartments that are empty three quarters of the year because their evil owners are mostly living at their other houses in la but if you are a middle class person in most of america you are not brought into incessant contact with things you ca n't afford there are n't lexus dealerships on every corner there are no snooty restaurants with water sommeliers to help you sort though the bottled eau selections you can afford most of the things at wal mart or kohl 's and the occasional meal at the macaroni grill moreover it would be socially unacceptable for you to pull up to church in a jaguar or to hire a caterer for your dinner party anyway so you are not plagued by a nagging feeling of doing without many americans admire the rich they do n't see society as a conflict zone between the rich and poor it 's taboo to say in a democratic culture but do you think a nation that watches katie couric in the morning tom hanks in the evening and michael jordan on weekends harbors deep animosity toward the affluent on the contrary i 'm writing this from nashville where one of the richest families the frists is hugely admired for its entrepreneurial skill and community service people do n't want to tax the frists they want to elect them to the senate and they did nor are americans suffering from false consciousness you go to a town where the factories have closed and people who once earned 14 an hour now work for 8 an hour they 've taken their hits but odds are you will find their faith in hard work and self reliance undiminished and their suspicion of washington unchanged americans resent social inequality more than income inequality as the sociologist jennifer lopez has observed do n't be fooled by the rocks that i got i 'm just i 'm just jenny from the block as long as rich people stay real in ms lopez 's formulation they are admired meanwhile middle class journalists and academics who seem to look down on megachurches suburbia and hunters are resented if americans see the tax debate as being waged between the economic elite led by president bush and the cultural elite led by barbra streisand they are going to side with mr bush who could come to any suburban barbershop and fit right in most americans do not have marxian categories in their heads this is the most important reason americans resist wealth redistribution the reason that subsumes all others americans do not see society as a layer cake with the rich on top the middle class beneath them and the working class and underclass at the bottom they see society as a high school cafeteria with their community at one table and other communities at other tables they are pretty sure that their community is the nicest and filled with the best people and they have a vague pity for all those poor souls who live in new york city or california and have a lot of money but no true neighbors and no free time all of this adds up to a terrain incredibly inhospitable to class based politics every few years a group of millionaire democratic presidential aspirants pretends to be the people 's warriors against the overclass they look inauthentic combative rather than unifying worst of all their basic message is not optimistic they have n't learned what franklin and teddy roosevelt and even bill clinton knew that you can run against rich people but only those who have betrayed the ideal of fair competition you have to be more hopeful and growth oriented than your opponent and you can not imply that we are a nation tragically and permanently divided by income in the gospel of america there are no permanent conflicts david brooks a senior editor at the weekly standard is author of bobos in paradise the new upper class and how they got there
