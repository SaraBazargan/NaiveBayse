 the bush administration might as well have sent charlton heston president of the national rifle association to deliver its opening address to a united nations conference on small arms earlier this week in a shameless subordination of diplomacy to domestic political pandering john r bolton the under secretary of state for arms control and international security told the gathering that washington would not support an agreement to curb the international flow of illicit small arms if it infringed on the right of americans to bear arms the united nations estimates that there are more than 500 million small arms in the world assault rifles machine guns grenade launchers and such and that they are used to kill at least half a million people each year mostly in third world war zones like sierra leone congo angola sri lanka and colombia the great majority of casualties are civilians the aim of the un conference is to produce a modest set of global standards and tracing methods that could help curtail the illicit flow of weapons that magnify civil wars arm child soldiers and militia gangs and expand the power of organized crime the clinton administration was at the forefront of international efforts to curtail small arms trafficking and american laws restricting the export of these weapons are models for international standards but the nra and other groups have claimed that international curbs on small arms trafficking represent an attempt by the united nations to interfere with american domestic firearms policy mr bolton 's address faithfully followed the nra script the draft documents before the conference would not infringe on gun ownership in the united states and in any case the conference 's plan of action will not be legally binding on any nation the conference is not about taking guns away from americans but about preventing guns from reaching the world 's dictators and warlords the substantive impact of mr bolton 's words on an already watered down agreement may be limited but by signaling its skepticism about small arms curbs washington may have stalled what little momentum there was toward broader international cooperation against the small arms trade his speech affords political cover for other major weapons producers like russia and china that have been recalcitrant about effective international curbs not to mention the cash poor governments in africa asia and latin america that have been their faithful customers
