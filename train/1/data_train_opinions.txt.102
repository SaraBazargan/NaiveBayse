 the right wingers who were beginning to feel like wallflowers at george w bush 's cabinet dance can stop complaining mr bush who made his earlier selections from his party 's ideological center threw a big bouquet to the ultraconservatives yesterday when he chose john ashcroft the recently deposed republican senator from missouri for the post of attorney general the nomination later in the day of christie whitman the moderate republican governor of new jersey to run the environmental protection agency tilted the overall composition of mr bush 's early choices back toward the center but that could not mute the widespread dismay over mr bush 's troubling choice of mr ashcroft mr bush is clearly hoping that mr ashcroft 's old colleagues will extend him the usual senatorial courtesies and confirm him with little dissent but mr ashcroft 's hard line ideology and extreme views and actions on issues like abortion and civil rights require a searching examination at his confirmation hearing he should not be given an automatic pass the senate is duty bound to determine whether he will be able to surmount his cramped social agenda to act as the guardian of the nation 's constitutional values the attorney general has great discretion in deciding how much energy to devote to protecting civil rights broadening civil liberties keeping society free of crime enforcing the antitrust laws and making sure that the president and his cabinet members are held to the same high standards an area in which the job 's present occupant janet reno has been deficient more than any other cabinet officer the attorney general sets the moral tone of an administration the position should clearly be filled with someone with a reputation for balance fairness and independence mr ashcroft is by all accounts honest and hard working yet he is also judging by the public record a man of cramped vision unyielding attitudes and limited tolerance for those who disagree with him his actions on racial matters alone are enough to give one pause as missouri 's attorney general he opposed even a voluntary school desegregation plan in metropolitan st louis he also conducted a mean spirited and dishonest campaign against ronnie white missouri 's first black state supreme court justice when justice white was nominated for a federal judgeship mr ashcroft claimed erroneously that justice white was soft on the death penalty as an added insult mr ashcroft also accepted an honorary degree last year from bob jones university a bastion of the christian right with a history of racial discrimination mr ashcroft has been one of the senate 's most adamant opponents of a woman 's right to choose an abortion during his political career in missouri he sought to criminalize abortion and he has consistently supported an extreme constitutional amendment that would ban abortion even in the case of rape or incest mr ashcroft has a poor record on church state issues and on gay rights and a dismal record on the environment there is thus reason to wonder how vigorously he will help mrs whitman enforce environmental laws with mrs whitman mr bush has offered a far more appealing nominee for high office his pledge to elevate the epa post to cabinet level is also commendable the epa is no less important than the interior department in providing responsible stewardship of the nation 's natural resources on the plus side mrs whitman seems genuine in caring about the environment and as a northeasterner she is intimately familiar with the problems of polluted air and water she joined with gov george pataki of new york in lawsuits aimed at curbing the pollution that drifts eastward from midwestern power plants and she has worked to protect the new jersey coastline by investing in sewage treatment and storm drainage projects although land conservation is mainly interior 's responsibility mrs whitman demonstrated a real appreciation for the importance of saving natural resources for future generations when she sponsored a 1 billion open space program the largest in new jersey 's history on the minus side she slashed the budget for environmental law enforcement and stopped levying meaningful fines against big polluters that pro business mind set will be disastrous if continued in her new job as will her oft repeated but naive faith in voluntary compliance with environmental laws as mrs whitman will discover there will be times when negotiating skills simply do n't suffice she must be willing to enforce the law in the face of relentless pressure not only from the big interest groups but from her superiors in the white house
