 to the editor re a military at war needs its gay soldiers by alastair gamble op ed nov 29 as a middle school teacher with a newly adopted daughter and a domestic partner of almost 18 years i have been discouraged from even discussing the existence of families like mine with my students clearly there is an unofficial do n't tell policy in effect in schools that is silently reinforced by legions of closeted gay teachers and administrators who like me fear reprisals for coming out to their students continuing exclusion of gay and lesbian role models from our schools houses of worship and privately run but publicly sanctioned programs like the boy scouts will only prolong our discriminatory military policies like the military our troubled schools would be better served by talented and dedicated gay people focused on doing their jobs and unencumbered by fears of reprisal or dismissal michael kandel douglaston queens nov 29 2002
