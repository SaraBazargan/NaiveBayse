 to the editor re a pool of swimmers editorial june 28 when looking for a home some two decades ago my husband a swim instructor and former lifeguard insisted on finding a home in a school district that housed a pool when faced with moving to a community that was divided by two school districts we told realtors not to show us homes in the second district because it did n't have a pool i 'm glad we made the decision to move to our district all three of our children have developed a love for swimming our oldest has just passed his recertification as an ocean lifeguard we never take for granted our pool and our close proximity to the atlantic ocean we only wish that more people took the time to see to it that their children get the opportunity to learn to swim and enjoy it mara p jacobowitz north woodmere ny june 28 2002
