 at a time when there seemed to be more than enough bad news to go around we woke up on saturday morning to tv bulletins about a missing space shuttle and then pictures of a disintegrating burning spacecraft streaking across the sky there was no way of knowing and there may be no way of knowing for days or months what went wrong with the space shuttle columbia there was only the realization that we were watching the death of seven astronauts and the scattering of their shuttle over the texas countryside the columbia is lost president bush told the nation there are no survivors it is difficult to conceive of these deaths which occurred in the boundary between space and the outer atmosphere in a moment in which normal flight shifted into catastrophe there had been joking about the seamlessness of the 16 day mission after a brief moment of concern at the start when a piece of insulation broke off the fuel tank and hit the left wing one of the many questions nasa will now have to examine is whether that incident did more damage to the shuttle than agency technicians initially suspected the fact that several sensors in that area of the shuttle shut down moments before the disaster could be an indication that yesterday 's fatal problems originated there the families who had gathered to celebrate columbia 's return to florida were gathered up and whisked away to be confronted with the terrible news there is something particularly awful about the vision of people waiting for a moment of joy and proud achievement suddenly smashing up against pain and loss instead no one who watched over and over as tv replayed the pictures of the explosion of the challenger in 1986 can forget that terrible picture the glowing expectations of mothers and fathers and wives and children torn away in a second and replaced by a kind of gaping numbness once again we were jolted out of a sustained period of success and safety in exploring the world outside our planet a run of good work and good luck that ran so long we had the luxury of taking it all for granted most americans were probably cheerfully unaware over the past 16 days that seven men and women were circling the planet conducting scientific experiments and then yesterday setting course for home it is amazing to realize as president bush said in his brief address that it has become easy to overlook the dangers of travel by rocket now once again we read the biographies of men and women who will not return we will admire their achievements for the first time as we are grieving their lives were cut short rick husband the mission commander william mccool the shuttle pilot david brown michael anderson laurel clark kalpana chawla and ilan ramon we will note over and over that despite the presence of colonel ramon an israeli pilot this was a very american crew men and women black and white immigrant and native born colonel ramon was already a hero in his country for his military exploits but with this flight he represented the desperate desire of his tortured nation to be part of peaceful progress to achieve great things in endeavors apart from the perpetual crisis that israel endures colonel ramon 's presence led nasa officials to order additional security measures for this flight but there was no early indication that terrorism or sabotage had anything to do with the tragedy in this particular moment of mourning our feelings were pure not tinged with vengeance or retribution or anger just unmitigated sadness
