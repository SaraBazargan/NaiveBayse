 to the editor thomas l friedman a tweezer defense shield column oct 19 describes being asked to check tweezers at an airport security checkpoint however the federal aviation administration explicitly lists tweezers as being permitted in aircraft cabins under its new security rules his experience would seem to be a perfect example of an undertrained and underpaid security officer enforcing a nonexistent policy unfortunately such ineffective security checks distract passengers from some real continuing security risks the lack of flight marshals and secure cockpit doors a dearth of well paid security personnel and the fact that not all checked baggage is x rayed if airlines wanted to make flying safer immediately they would suspend any flights that did not address these risks samuel greenfield brooklyn oct 19 2001
