 to the editor an oct 1 obituary about jackie flosso said the family refused to clean its magic shop to avoid disturbing the dust of houdini who was once a part owner of the store this must have been true as a 14 year old amateur magician i would save a few pennies each month to visit the shop it had two doors one leading to the showroom the other locked to the back room on my first few visits the showroom was a wonderful world of chaos counters piled with tricks silks and gadgets if mr flosso could n't find an item after rummaging through the piles he would go to the back room and bring it out if not purchased it would be tossed onto the growing pile several months later i returned the back room had become the showroom it would appear that houdini 's dust had so clogged the original showroom that it was inaccessible and became the back room i ca n't say how long it took for the arrangement to again be reversed david v cohn louisville ky oct 1 2003
