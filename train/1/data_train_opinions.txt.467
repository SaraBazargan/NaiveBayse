 the republican convention in philadelphia set aside its nurturing themes about children last night and returned to the traditional gop territory of defense policy and military strength popular war heroes like former senator bob dole and gen norman schwarzkopf implied that the clinton administration had let veterans down and allowed defenses to erode but a strangely subdued note was struck by the keynote speaker senator john mccain the self described distant runner up his generous but obviously unenthusiastic praise of gov george w bush was punctuated with intimations of his own mortality his maudlin address seemed designed to echo gen douglas macarthur 's farewell and perhaps to suggest a subtext of i shall return if mr bush falters in november keynote speeches are usually aimed at firing up the crowd mr mccain 's passive approach flattened the already placid mood of the convention few delegates were likely to be convinced by his praise of the prospective nominee as my friend moreover mr mccain a former prisoner of war in vietnam described a convoluted generational and military link to the texas governor by asserting that his grandfather had been former president george bush 's commander in world war ii then he conceded that it is my turn to serve under the son of my grandfather 's brave subordinate before one of the most tranquilizing keynote addresses in modern convention history the podium last night seemed like a kind of class reunion for the gulf war it was a tableau with certain pitfalls as well as advantages for governor bush like the choice of former defense secretary dick cheney as his running mate the evening reminded the audience that the war was the high point of mr bush 's father 's term in the white house without offering much of a suggestion about the policies of another bush presidency some listeners might also recall that as a senator from tennessee al gore broke with many democrats and supported the war the idea that military spending suddenly declined under president clinton is also based partly on myth the pentagon budget began declining under president bush and has risen in recent years under mr clinton and his republican defense secretary convention speeches are not to be confused with subtle foreign policy pronouncements but there has been a certain confusion about republican declarations on foreign policy that mr bush will eventually have to clear up the most extensive statements on the subject have come from the governor 's main foreign policy adviser condoleezza rice who also spoke at the convention last night her criticism of the administration is that it has spent too much time on trivial humanitarian interests and failed to deal seriously with potential rivals like china and russia or cultivate major allies cooperating with allies sounds good in principle but mr bush seems determined to embark on a risky missile defense system that major european allies regard as unworkable the republican convention as it has in all things has papered over cleavages within the domestic ranks on foreign policy mr bush had to repudiate his own congressional leadership early this year when he called for support of american peacekeeping efforts in kosovo sorting these issues out will come only when vice president gore gets a chance to challenge mr bush after the conventions all that americans learned last night was the importance of military strength how that strength is to be used will have to be elucidated in the campaign to come
