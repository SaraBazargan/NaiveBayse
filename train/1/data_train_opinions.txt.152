 a minor mystery in the current presidential campaign involves the people who turn out to listen to steve forbes 's speeches the mystery would be why as a candidate mr forbes is a guy in a suit who works a room as if he were proctoring a test thanks to his extraordinarily immobile features he always looks precisely the same from nose upward no matter what his mood offstage he hardly seems to exist his staff sort of carts him away when the speeches are over and there are no steve forbes anecdotes either charming or chilling he has spent more than 60 million over the last four years trying to buy his way into the presidential race but he does n't even seem to dabble in conspicuous consumption during his most recent iowa swing he and his wife were spending their rest times at the neighborhood econo lodge but no matter how remote the town or treacherous the weather there 's a roomful of people waiting patiently to hear him speak it 's hard to explain what brings them out since i have finally and reluctantly accepted the fact that he is not hiring them none of his issues seem to have much pull the polls show voters are apathetic about tax cuts of any size let alone one as complicated and controversial as mr forbes 's pet proposal he 's trying to appeal to the christian right this week he said george w bush was a timid abortion opponent while he was bold bold appears to be the adjective of choice this year perhaps this race lacking any other focus will be remembered for recycling old laundry detergent names let 's call the bush tax cuts fab but dissatisfied social conservatives seem to yearn for a candidate with fire in the belly and they can get more passion than mr forbes is offering in alan keyes or gary bauer or the telephone book still the sight of all those upturned faces has energized the candidate sort of i 'm pumped up mr forbes keeps saying with exactly the same expression he uses when vowing to drive a stake through the tax code or inquiring whether everybody liked the free chili the newly peppy speeches sound like an infomercial in which mr forbes explains how we can all become winners in the game of life by instituting a flat tax and privatizing social security you take someone on minimum wage their whole lives they 'll have upwards of 200000 when they retire the serious presidential candidates generally ignore the forbes campaign but in iowa the republican establishment has been attempting to demonize him as an archfiend of negative advertising senator charles grassley is on the radio warning the public to beware of possible anti bush ads as if they were radioactive at the first sign of negativity he urges hang up the phone throw the mail out and change the station while mr bush was busy hammering on john mccain in new hampshire his staff in iowa was complaining that a forbes pamphlet had been rigged to make mr bush 's ears look big if this keeps up mr forbes may actually qualify for the sympathy vote his organization which is the best money can buy may compensate for his lack of pizazz but americans still prefer presidential candidates who seem to have at least a modicum of an idea what they 're getting into and the forbes people want the nation to entrust its security to a guy whose chief claim to fame is that he once ran a business his father gave him you ca n't spend your way around that problem the campaign however is selling his lack of credentials as his big strength and his supporters seem to agree almost invariably they say they are in his corner because he 's not tainted or he does n't run with the ones in washington maybe the mysterious forbes audiences are made up of voters who believed the gingrich revolution would refashion america in their own image when things sort of fizzled out perhaps they gave up on politicians completely and decided to place their bets on someone so uncharismatic he could be trusted not to trick them the way politicians did or on the other hand it could just be that people who live in iowa in the winter have a lot of time on their hands it was either come here or go to exercise class one elderly woman said
