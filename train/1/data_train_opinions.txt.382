 the high point make that the low point of the american way of death is jessica mitford 's account of a friend 's attempt to bury a relative without spending a fortune when the friend asked for an inexpensive redwood coffin the funeral home agreed at first but the salesman called back to say the deceased was too tall and she had to buy a coffin that cost 100 more when ms mitford 's friend balked the salesman responded oh all right we 'll use the redwood one but we 'll have to cut off his feet this summer it feels as if big business is letting us down as never before but corporate scandals have been a part of american history since the yazoo land fraud of 1795 thirty nine years ago ms mitford exposed one of the most jaw dropping of all the great funeral industry scandal of 1963 her findings acerbically set forth in her surprise best seller hold some important lessons for today 's reformers this unlikely scandal was set off by an unlikely crusader one of six daughters of the baron of redesdale ms mitford left the british aristocracy behind and married bob treuhaft an oakland trade union lawyer from him she learned that when working men died their hard won death benefits intended to support their widows and children invariably ended up in the pockets of unscrupulous undertakers on the trail of injustice ms mitford made undercover visits to funeral parlors and pored over back issues of casket sunnyside and the rest is muckraking history the american way of death soared to the top of the new york times best seller list and ignited a firestorm cbs turned it into an hourlong documentary and newspapers from new york to san francisco investigated local funeral practices ms mitford 's encounters with shady undertakers and cemetery plot salesmen led her to some conclusions that apply to today 's corporate scandals or most likely soon will 1 never underestimate corporate greed before her book came out funeral directors presented themselves as humble comforters of the bereaved but ms mitford showed that they charged more to bury 17 million americans a year than universities charged to educate 36 million many observers of today 's scandals have been shocked by how far rich people will go to become richer bernard ebbers who took in more than 46 million at worldcom still grabbed nearly a million shares of hot ipo stock possibly illegally martha stewart who is worth a good fraction of a billion dollars took the time to personally trade perhaps using insider information a few thousand shares of imclone stock having met prosperous businessmen who would threaten to cut off a loved one 's feet to make a few more bucks ms mitford would not have been a bit surprised 2 corporate crooks often tell us exactly what they 're doing much of the american way of death is simply excerpts from the funeral industry 's own publications the book successful funeral management warned undertakers not to line up coffins by price since it made it too easy for the grieving family to comparison shop so it is with the current scandal where the most damning evidence is in many cases the wrongdoers own words wall street analysts issued buy recommendations while yukking it up in internal e mails that the stocks were junk ceo 's made bullish pronouncements duping their shareholders and employees while filling out forms to sell their own stock when their words are quoted back to them in legal indictments it will be akin to what ms mitford retorted to funeral directors who complained about her book she could not see why they were unhappy since it was almost entirely given over to expounding their point of view 3 sometimes it is n't just the bad apples president bush has tried to argue that the misdeeds of enron worldcom and the rest are ethical lapses of a few bad actors and that the solution is criminal prosecutions but the point of the american way of death is that the funeral industry as a whole was corrupt this would normally be the place to say 'i am not of course speaking of the vast majority of ethical undertakers ms mitford wrote in the foreword but the vast majority of ethical undertakers is precisely the subject of this book the only solution she insisted as reformers today must was sweeping reform 4 reform comes slowly for those hoping for meaningful reform now the funeral experience is sobering when the american way of death came out in 1963 the public was outraged but despite a flood of angry letters it took the federal trade commission until 1972 to begin an investigation it was 12 more years before it adopted over strenuous industry lobbying a rule instituting some of the reforms ms mitford had recommended the new rule required funeral homes but not cemeteries to itemize services and costs in advance so consumers could decide which they wanted still when ms mitford died in 1996 much of her agenda had been blocked the senate held hearings this summer on a bill to be introduced later this month that would among other things require cemeteries to itemize costs just in time for the 40th anniversary of ms mitford 's explosive little book
