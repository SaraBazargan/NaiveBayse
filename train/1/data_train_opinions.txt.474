 to the editor re generous to a fault op ed march 21 by amy domini and thomas van dyck while it is true that foundations are required to spend a minimum of 5 percent of their assets each year and that these assets have been rapidly growing over the last several years a higher percentage of expenditure should not be mandated foundations should maintain a wise and prudent investment and expenditure philosophy keeping their long term missions firmly in place the 5 percent minimum does not preclude a nonprofit from additional expenditures and as the writers note many do finance above this limit any government intervention should be limited to incentives and encouragement not new shortsighted regulations that could hamper future activities scott schirmer st louis march 21 2000
