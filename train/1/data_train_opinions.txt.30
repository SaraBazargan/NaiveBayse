 to the editor re labor standards clash with global reality front page april 24 i would be willing to pay more for a shirt if i knew that it was made by workers earning a decent wage not child laborers or virtual slaves yet i often have to settle for sweatshop made shirts because there is n't much of a choice right now consumers routinely pay more for products not tested on animals or made from recycled paper i am confident that a sweatshop free label would sell very well regardless of the added cost mikael elsila brooklyn april 24 2001
