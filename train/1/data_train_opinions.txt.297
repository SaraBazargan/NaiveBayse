 gasoline prices hover around 2 a gallon in parts of the united states and threaten to rise to similar levels in many other regions consumers are upset and there is no easy solution to the problem congressional republicans thought for a time that they had a deft answer in going after what they called the gore tax the 43 cents per gallon that a democrat controlled congress tacked onto the federal gas tax in 1993 but this week republican leaders abandoned that frivolous idea if it were effective reducing taxes on gasoline would only encourage americans to buy more foreign oil at the same time that saudi arabia and other oil producers have tripled their price but the tax cut would mostly benefit oil companies which could raise prices to offset it rather than consumers congress does have a partial remedy at hand lying in salt domes in louisiana and texas are about 600 million barrels of oil this strategic petroleum reserve was created to handle genuine oil crises not the run up in home heating oil prices in new england last month and in gasoline prices this month but there is a policy called swaps that would provide some relief without compromising the use of the reserve for a future crisis the idea is to invite oil companies to remove oil today from the reserve expanding the supply and easing prices somewhat in exchange for returning an even larger amount of oil in the future swaps would knock only about a nickel off the price of gasoline according to one estimate the simple fact is that americans will gain substantially lower prices for gasoline only if oil exporters decide to increase production by a substantial amount the exporters will meet later this month and discuss raising production by about one to two million barrels a day that could cut gas prices by up to 75 cents a gallon americans can also weaken the impact of high oil prices no matter what the future levels by cutting back consumption yet foreign oil exports will continue to dominate america 's energy picture and will operate largely independent of what americans do
