 since the vietnam war the american defense debate could be characterized as republicans wanting more of the same tanks ships and planes and democrats wanting less there were some important differences between the parties over questions of intervention and strategy peacekeeping and war fighting but when it came to military programs and hardware the political divide was simply a matter of scale george w bush when he was still texas governor tried to change all that in a september 1999 speech calling for a revolution at the pentagon it was a speech that said quite simply we do n't need more or less of the same defense we need a very different defense but now george w bush 's plan to transform the military is coming back to haunt the pentagon and in particular defense secretary donald rumsfeld as a candidate mr bush proposed the biggest changes in our military forces since the 1930 's strategic and bureaucratic initiatives meant to move the pentagon away from an industrial age outgrowth of our world war ii and cold war forces those magnificent tanks ships and planes and toward a leaner longer range and more precise force intended to deter and combat the threats of the future this transformed military would use advances in computing and information technology to pack more punch than today 's forces do but in very different form large and slow moving aircraft carriers would give way to submarines and other stealthier ships that would deliver much more than a carrier 's worth of precision guided munitions f 22 aircraft meant for dogfights would give way to long range bombers and to unmanned aircraft not limited by a human being in the cockpit large and cumbersome army divisions full of tanks and artillery would give way to smaller lighter more lethal and more agile formations all this force would be stitched together by real time space based information systems and applied in new ways the military knows this change is coming its own planning documents and vision statements all refer explicitly to these changes in warfare but putting the vision into action means short term pain and wrenching change neither of which the pentagon handles well moreover the congressional budget office estimates that even with dramatically increased defense spending the pentagon will over the next decade still be unable to afford sustaining and improving the cold war force now mr rumsfeld is backed into a corner the political and economic bill for trying to bring this agenda to fruition has come due if mr rumsfeld legitimizes the pentagon 's status quo responses more tanks ships and planes slightly improved to his proposals he undermines mr bush and keeps the pentagon in a spiral of steadily deteriorating readiness rapidly rising equipment replacement costs and increasing strategic irrelevance if he pushes the president 's agenda forward he faces the iron triangle of congress the uniformed chiefs of the armed services and the defense industry which to little notice roundly criticized mr bush 's defense platform during the campaign judging from his recent remarks on the very small percentage of the military that he would change mr rumsfeld has decided to move slowly to those who doubt that one can have a revolution in slow motion with cautious bureaucrats managing the change it looks as if he 's throwing in the towel but the pentagon can still be transformed along the lines president bush laid out in his campaign like any radical shift in a big institution this change would have to be accomplished with a mixture of cunning compromise and ruthlessness the first step would be to fire some generals and admirals no group in washington resists change more effectively than the uniformed services which control more than 85 percent of the pentagon 's budget with little effective civilian oversight so far mr rumsfeld has seemed to expect the military leaders who grew up in the old system to be his agents of change that would not happen in any organization and certainly not in the military mr rumsfeld needs to reach down into the ranks and bring up leaders who can help make the transformation in his first year as chief of staff george c marshall retired 55 generals and over 400 colonels from the army as he attempted to remake the force just before world war ii marshall knew he had to change the army of world war i to one that could take on hitler 's military innovations and he knew he could n't do it with leaders who grew up in the horse cavalry mr rumsfeld should also work hard to encourage experimentation not only with new weapons but also with new war fighting concepts and new forms of organization the military has been bemoaning its risk averse culture for a decade but has done nothing to correct it few officers will take unusual assignments or publish controversial ideas there is a bland corporateness about military culture these days and no one will risk failure yet our military history shows that experimentation despite the unavoidable failures that will occur leads to dramatic change and success mr rumsfeld should thrust some mavericks into the limelight the old saw is that the military prepares to fight the last war under current doctrine the united states is prepared to fight two the korean war and desert storm almost all of the pentagon 's energies are directed at refighting those wars in basically the same way with the same if updated systems while there is no doubt that america should retain the capability to triumph in such conflicts it should not shoehorn its efforts into outdated war plans the pressing military need of the next 25 years will be to get to the future of warfare before the other guy mr rumsfeld 's biggest mistake so far has been to let others emphasize the costs of losing the cold war force before he articulated the security benefits and other advantages of military reform for both the defense industry and congress he should demonstrate the likely industrial and technological byproducts from creating new kinds of forces and weapons systems in the era of the cold war military for example research for defense purposes developed the use of satellites for communication and created the internet why did the pentagon start with the bad news finally mr rumsfeld needs solid white house support he can not operate in isolation from politics after all we do n't have a military for its own sake it is simply the means to ensure american security president bush needs to lay out a national security plan that describes what we hope to accomplish in the world against what obstacles in concert with which friends and with what kind of military and because this military transformation will happen over a 20 year period the president will need to stretch his vision out to encompass a few decades only then will the transformation of the armed forces make practical and political sense john hillen is chief operating officer of island ecn an electronic trading network in new york he was a defense adviser to the bush campaign and is co author of future visions for us defense policy
