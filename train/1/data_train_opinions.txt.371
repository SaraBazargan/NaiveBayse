 the current crisis in american capitalism is n't just about the specific details about tricky accounting stock options loans to executives and so on it 's about the way the game has been rigged on behalf of insiders and the bush administration is full of such insiders that 's why president bush can not get away with merely rhetorical opposition to executive wrongdoers to give the most extreme example so far how can we take his moralizing seriously when thomas white whose division of enron generated 500 million in phony profits and who sold 12 million in stock just before the company collapsed is still secretary of the army yet everything mr bush has said and done lately shows that he does n't get it asked about the aloha petroleum deal at his former company harken energy in which big profits were recorded on a sale that was paid for by the company itself a transaction that obviously had no meaning except as a way to inflate reported earnings he responded there was an honest difference of opinion sometimes things are n't exactly black and white when it comes to accounting procedures and he still opposes both reforms that would reduce the incentives for corporate scams such as requiring companies to count executive stock options against profits and reforms that would make it harder to carry out such scams such as not allowing accountants to take consulting fees from the same firms they audit the closest thing to a substantive proposal in mr bush 's tough talking nearly content free speech on tuesday was his call for extra punishment for executives convicted of fraud but that 's an empty threat in reality top executives rarely get charged with crimes not a single indictment has yet been brought in the enron affair and even chainsaw al dunlap a serial book cooker faces only a civil suit and they almost never get convicted accounting issues are technical enough to confuse many juries expensive lawyers make the most of that confusion and if all else fails big name executives have friends in high places who protect them in this as in so much of the corporate governance issue the current wave of scandal is prefigured by president bush 's own history an aside some pundits have tried to dismiss questions about mr bush 's business career as unfair it was long ago and hence irrelevant yet many of these same pundits thought it was perfectly appropriate to spend seven years and 70 million investigating a failed land deal that was even further in bill clinton 's past and if they want something more recent how about reporting on the story of mr bush 's extraordinarily lucrative investment in the texas rangers which became so profitable because of a highly incestuous web of public policy and private deals as in the case of harken no hard work is necessary joe conason laid it all out in harper 's almost two years ago but the harken story still has more to teach us because the sec investigation into mr bush 's stock sale is a perfect illustration of why his tough talk wo n't scare well connected malefactors mr bush claims that he was vetted by the sec in fact the agency 's investigation was peculiarly perfunctory it somehow decided that mr bush 's perfectly timed stock sale did not reflect inside information without interviewing him or any other members of harken 's board maybe top officials at the sec felt they already knew enough about mr bush his father the president had appointed a good friend as sec chairman and the general counsel who would normally make decisions about legal action had previously been george w bush 's personal lawyer he negotiated the purchase of the texas rangers i am not making this up most corporate wrongdoers wo n't be quite as well connected as the young mr bush but like him they will expect and probably receive kid glove treatment in an interesting parallel today 's sec which claims to be investigating the highly questionable accounting at halliburton that turned a loss into a reported profit has yet to interview the ceo at the time dick cheney the bottom line is that in the last week any hopes you might have had that mr bush would make a break from his past and champion desperately needed corporate reform have been dashed mr bush is not a real reformer he just plays one on tv e mail krugman nytimescom
