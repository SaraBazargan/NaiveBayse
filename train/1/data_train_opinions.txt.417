 no wonder george w bush looked frustrated when news of worldcom 's monster con game reached the hilltop in canada where heads of the world 's biggest economies were gathering long gone are the days when a triumphal american leader could attend these summit conferences and gloat about the superiority of our home grown capitalism even president vladimir putin of russia was moved to express grave concern about american accounting practices worldcom the telecommunications giant reported late tuesday that it had overstated its operating cash flow by 38 billion in the last five quarters by improperly booking ordinary expenses as capital expenditures to be depreciated over time even a child can understand that painting your house is not the same as building a new one but that basic concept seems to have eluded the people who were paid to keep an eye on worldcom 's books it 's no wonder that europeans are now beginning to recoil from america 's demand that the rest of the world adopt the accounting principles used in the united states coming on the heels of enron and a slew of other prominent financial scandals worldcom 's apparent fraud left washington regulators reeling as well it might in a speech on wednesday night harvey pitt chairman of the securities and exchange commission quoted the line from the movie network i 'm mad as hell and i 'm not going to take it anymore mr pitt said chief executives of major corporations would now have to certify their companies financial statements personally which is a good thing echoing the president 's vow to hold people accountable mr pitt said corporate crooks and charlatans would be doing jail time and that too is fine yet there is a lot more that mr pitt who has been accused of being much too cozy with the accounting industry could do as a policy maker one obvious move is to issue a blanket rule that auditors can not provide companies whose books they police with any other services the simple nature yet breathtaking scale of worldcom 's deceit raises anew all the enron questions about the failure of market guardians to prevent it was anyone on the board of directors even remotely suspicious why did n't the auditing firm arthur andersen realize that the company was booking false profits did high profile worldcom boosters on wall street give the company 's phony numbers a pass because they were eager to win worldcom 's banking business one positive byproduct of this seemingly endless parade of companies behaving badly could be a turnaround in congress if our elected officials have any sense of embarrassment paul sarbanes sensible accounting reform bill ought to sail through the senate and prevail over a weaker house version in conference certainly if every lawmaker who benefited from campaign contributions from now discredited companies and financial institutions votes for it it will be on president bush 's desk quicker than you can say market fundamentals in the meantime anxious investors are left to wonder what other financial scandals lie around the corner america 's status as the world 's ultimate safe haven for investors is looking shaky the huge inflow of foreign capital 400 billion a year has been a key factor in the country 's recent prosperity two fifths of all treasury bonds are in foreign hands an erosion of confidence in the united states could accelerate the dollar 's recent decline and dry up needed credit capital flight is a danger we usually associate with countries like argentina but a few more worldcoms and the comparison may seem apt we have been down this road before but there is something about the sight of billions of dollars in potential profits that makes investors forget the lessons of history in the 1920 's and 1980 's speculative run ups were followed by a painful relearning of certain basic truths breathless hype about the dawn of a new gravity defying era and accounting gimmicks are no substitute for real profits it may come as little consolation to worldcom shareholders who have lost 150 billion since the stock reached its all time high in 1999 but the flushing out of the dishonest self dealers is the first step toward a recovery
