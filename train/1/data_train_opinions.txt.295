 president bush tried to fix the economy before lunch yesterday he managed to last for 20 minutes each in four economic seminars at baylor university he dutifully scribbled some notes as participants talked looking as happy as a high school kid in trig class and bounded out of his chair when treasury secretary paul o'neill told him he could be excused yes well a visibly relieved mr bush said jumping up after an exhausting 18 minutes in economic recovery and job creation that 's the life of the president always has to go or as the radical economist groucho marx once observed hello i must be going the seminars lasted only an hour and a half but mr bush and dick cheney divided the eight so as not to overly tax themselves by the final session mr bush was staring into space finding the talk of stimulus unstimulating as the president told one group i can assure that even though i wo n't be sitting through every single moment of the seminars nor will the vice president we will look at the summaries the cliffsnotes presidency before wrapping up with chicken salad key lime pie and stars and stripes forever the president did some cheerleading even though times are kind of tough right now mr bush drawled we 're america as usual when the president talks up the economy the dow dived under the bed dropping 206 points he thanked all the good folks for putting on a great show like his dad w reads his stage directions it was a message i care pr pageant so why not just say so his father accused of being out of touch on the economy got in trouble for checking his watch twice during a debate with bill clinton that 's why w did n't even wear a watch while debating al gore but perhaps because of his short attention span the younger bush always gives the impression of checking his watch although it seemed that mr bush wanted to go deeper into his job after 9 11 he 's still riding the surface treating photo ops like real events and passing off fortune cookie comments as policy pronouncements this president 's speed dial economic summit was an interesting contrast with the last president 's preening cult of personality economic summit a decade ago mr bush as always seemed to be trying to get through the morning without saying anything that would expose him as empty headed he has a pathological fear of talking bill clinton has a pathological fear of not talking he held a talkathon in little rock before he started his presidency also for self serving pr reasons while mr clinton wanted to convey concern about the economy he inherited from bush pere he mostly wanted to show off his wonkishness putting on the glasses he had rarely worn during the campaign the smartest kid in the class dominated the room for two long days without yawning once the vice president dragged back from fishing in wyoming to scurry around the waco sessions with mr bush was caught on camera stifling yawns twice while mr clinton designed his summit to show that democrats could be cozy with big business mr bush designed his summit to show that he is not too cozy with big business at one of his drop bys yesterday mr bush admitted to longing to see a few corporate malefactors in handcuffs and white house planners were careful to scatter token blue collar folks among the customary blue chip folks the bush family used to sit outside the clinton white house stewing that bill had besmirched the honor of the oval office that they held dear now the clinton family sits outside the bush white house stewing that w has besmirched the spectacular but somewhat artificial boom they held dear the clintons would love to see president bush lately of harken energy endure his own equivalent of kenneth starr the scandalous condition of american capitalism has even provided hillary clinton with the political opening she needed by insisting that the average american 's financial well being was better in clinton times than bush times she is breaking ground for her presidential campaign in 2008 if she can wait that long e mail liberties nytimescom
