 to the editor re david merrick 88 showman who ruled broadway dies front page april 27 having worked for david merrick from 1967 to 1970 as his director of casting i can attest to the accuracy of your rendering of this extremely complex man every one of his employees down to the switchboard operator walked on eggshells but we knew we were working for the greatest broadway producer of our time he was surprisingly very shy and insecure his choice of sitting in the back of sardi 's was n't so much a snub as it was about his not having to talk to anyone because of disagreements coinciding with an outside offer i expected to be fired before i could quit instead mr merrick made an offer for me to stay when i declined he congratulated me and made a point of sending me two opening night tickets to all of the shows i had in production i think behind his ruthless reputation mr merrick did have a heart hugh fordin president drg records new york april 27 2000
