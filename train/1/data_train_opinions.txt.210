 marching across the south in 1865 union soldiers seized up to 900000 acres of abandoned property some radical northerners hoped to use this land to provide freed slaves with the now legendary 40 acres and a mule as restitution for slavery their hopes were obviously dashed but the argument for reparations lives on nearly 140 years later while few doubt that slavery was a great wrong the challenge before us is how to make things right through financial restitution but just how would we devise a practical formula to determine who gets what most assessments start with the notion of payment for lost wages one researcher took 1860 's prices for slaves as an estimate of their labor value and applied compound interest the result 2 trillion to 4 trillion six generations after slavery 's demise such approaches present serious difficulties there are issues of what to do with whites and blacks who immigrated here after slavery ended what about descendants of blacks who lived freely during the antebellum period does someone who is born to a white parent and a black parent cancel out it would take solomon to solve this perhaps the issue needs to be looked at differently one way is to recognize slavery as an institution upon which america 's wealth was built if we take this view it is not important whether a white family arrived in 1700 or in 1965 if you wear cotton blue jeans if you take out an insurance policy if you buy from anyone who has a connection to the industries that were built on chattel labor then you have benefited from slavery likewise if you are black regardless of when your ancestors arrived you live with slavery 's stigma extending the reparations argument this broadly frees one to move beyond the issue of lost wages and seek out other factors on which to base a formula if there were one statistic that captured the persistence of racial inequality it would be net worth the typical white family enjoys a net worth that is more than eight times that of its black counterpart according to the economist edward wolff even at equivalent income levels gaps remain large among families earning less than 15000 a year the median african american family has a net worth of zero while the corresponding white family has 10000 in equity the typical white family earning 40000 annually has a nest egg of around 80000 its black counterpart has about half that amount this equity inequity is partly the result of the head start whites enjoy in accumulating and passing on assets some economists estimate that up to 80 percent of lifetime wealth accumulation results from gifts from earlier generations ranging from the down payment on a home to a bequest by a parent if the government used such net worth inequality as a basis and then factored in measures like population size it could address reparations by transferring about 13 percent of white household wealth to blacks a two adult black family would receive an average reparation of about 35000 what would be the effect of wealth redistribution on such a vast scale my own research using national data to follow black and white adolescents into adulthood shows that when we compare families with the same net worth blacks are more likely to finish high school than whites and are equally likely to complete a bachelor 's degree racial differences in welfare rates disappear thus one generation after reparations were paid racial gaps in education should close eliminating the need for affirmative action the unpopularity of this radical plan would no doubt be unprecedented there are also no guarantees that reparations would be a magic bullet for lingering racial problems that said it remains vital especially during black history month to explore formulas and keep the reparations debate alive it is important because each resulting dollar amount implies a theory of race history and equal opportunity that includes the figure implicit in our current policy zero which rests on the most absurd assumption of all that slavery did n't matter dalton conley associate professor of sociology and director of the center for advanced social science research at new york university is author of being black living in the red race wealth and social policy in america and honky
