 in the 1976 election campaign jimmy carter vowed to withdraw us troops from south korea when mr carter won the first words he had to eat were his vow to withdraw us troops from south korea as congress and the allies revolted against him should george w bush win it is useful to consider how different a world he and his foreign policy advisers would confront from the last time colin powell dick cheney condi rice and paul wolfowitz were in office with president bush eight years ago the book on governor bush is that while he does n't know much about the world his advisers who were all his father 's advisers are experts that is true but many are experts in a world that does n't exist anymore we do not have a cold war global system anymore we do n't have a cold war military and we do n't have a cold war public in short this ai n't your father 's foreign policy the players may be the same but the world is n't here are five things president bush could never have taught his son about the world 1 while america was certainly a superpower when president bush left office its economy was just coming out of stagnation and the soviet union had just collapsed today america is not just a superpower it 's a hyperpower with both unrivaled military might and an information economy that is the envy of the world what 's new in all this is that while other countries still call for us leadership they envy and resent america more than ever no one wants to be america 's enemy but few want to be perceived as its friend and what that means is that if mr bush tries out some of the more macho unilateralist policies talked about by his advisers such as abrogating the abm treaty or sponsoring an uprising in iraq he will face a ferocious reaction from us rivals and allies alike for instance because of us economic sanctions on iraq saddam hussein is now more popular than ever on the arab street indeed i am sorry to report a huge cheer would go up from the arab street today if iraq were to acquire nuclear weapons to counterbalance the us and israel 2 president bush had to manage the waxing military power of china the waning military power of the soviet union and the soaring economic power of japan what us foreign policy is about today is managing the weakness of china the weakness of russia and the weakness of japan as all three go through the wrenching internal adjustments to globalization that have made their possible collapse more threatening to us than their strength in the bush years us officials liked to say we lead japan pays now we must lead and pay 3 the internet did not exist as a foreign policy tool when president bush left office today it 's huge jody williams won the nobel peace prize for organizing a global ban on land mines against the wishes of the major powers using e mail if governor bush really did try to abrogate the abm treaty unilaterally and cram it down the throats of the russians and europeans i believe it could trigger a seattle like internet driven mass based anti nuclear protest against the us identical to the popular movement in europe today against america 's genetically modified foods this could make it impossible for any nato ally to cooperate with the us on missile defenses 4 america was a deficit country when president bush left office and now it is a surplus country that means that the republican ethos of steadily cutting back government and the foreign affairs budget is not only unnecessary it 's reckless and it will be perceived by the world as increasingly selfish indeed it 's easy for the bushies to sneer that they wo n't be the world 's 911 or global cops but such aloofness is much harder in practice now that america is so dominant as the clintonites discovered we are now held responsible for everything but americans do n't want to die for virtually anything so finding ways to make a sustainable difference in places such as kosovo or rwanda is a lot harder than uttering a sound bite 5 globalization the speed interconnectivity and economic impact of global markets today is much greater than eight years ago if mr bush does try a deep tax cut that the markets perceive as reckless their judgment on him will be nasty brutish and swift swifter than he may ever imagine other than that nothing 's changed
