 more than 3000 years ago from his compound on the banks of the nile ramses ii issued an order that modern day governors and mayors will find depressingly familiar ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore the pharaoh commanded let them go and gather straw for themselves but they still had to produce the same number of bricks ramses ii had invented the unfunded mandate in the short run it was not a success the hebrew people against whom the mandate was directed thought it so unfair that they left egypt altogether over the ensuing centuries however countless government officials at all levels have played it pharaoh 's way they have seized upon the idea that if you are in a position of power you can tell underlings to do anything you want them to do you do n't have to explain the reasoning you do n't have to provide the equipment and while some will complain of the injustice of it all most will comply unlike the ancient hebrews they have no miracles to call on and no promised land to flee to this is the flaw in any experiment with federalism including america 's congress can demand that states institute elaborate new testing programs for schoolchildren offering no money to pay for them a federal agency can impose billions of dollars in security costs on local law enforcement officials and postpone the question of how to pay them until another day states can cut back drastically on their support for public health at the local level while insisting that local authorities keep the service going just as before nobody is innocent here the feds stiff the states the states stiff the cities and counties whenever one layer of government can push an unpleasant or costly responsibility down to the level below it nearly always does so the cities and counties would do it too except they are on the bottom rung yet we are astonishingly earnest about pretending to worship an entirely different set of principles for hundreds of years philosophers across the ideological spectrum have preached the virtue of devolution higher levels of political power and authority should grant as much freedom as possible to lower ones on the grounds that greater wisdom really does reside at the grass roots in the roman catholic church devolution goes by the name of subsidiarity the principle that as pope john paul ii once put it a community of a higher order should not interfere in the internal life of a community of a lower order to the radical students for a democratic society in the 1960 's devolution was a new kind of participatory democracy through which our monster cities might now be humanized broken into smaller communities arranged according to community decision for most conservative republicans in the years since the reagan administration it has been an article of faith that the best government is government closest to the people that the states are closer to the people than washington is and the localities closer still the fact that most of us find these principles congenial and sensible however does not deter governments from blithely ignoring them it was a devolution preaching republican congress that passed a bill in 1999 forbidding states to collect sales tax on transactions over the internet without a fig leaf of an explanation why this was their business and it was a devolution professing democratic president a former governor himself who signed it into law one might have expected something different from george w bush who as governor of texas spent six years in austin bristling at the intrusions of washington in his state 's affairs but no such outburst of intellectual consistency was forthcoming not only is there the administration 's school testing mandate which could cost state and local governments up to 8 billion but there is the huge problem of medicaid costs the most serious culprit in the states financial troubles medicaid is officially a joint state federal responsibility yet the president has shown little interest in helping the states meet their obligations earlier this year the governors descended on washington to plead for help with their worsening budget crisis we 've got an issue with our own budget the president told them in other words you 're on your own deal with it but keep those bricks coming here 's an idea if the bush administration wants to avoid paying too much for the reconstruction of iraq all it has to do is grant iraq statehood then it could just refuse to give it any money the federal government would save tens of billions of dollars it 's enough to make you feel sorry for the states until you see them treating their own cities and counties the same way to take just one example of about 50 mike easley governor of north carolina last year closed a hole in the state budget by simply seizing more than 200 million in tax money that was supposed to have paid for local health care education and criminal justice one might portray this as yet another example of the strong picking on the weak but in a federal system unreasonable demands from above are n't a sign of strength they 're a sign of weakness when the system actually works as it occasionally does the leaders at the top of the pyramid do one of two things they take up a problem conceive a solution and figure out a way to pay for it as the federal government did with social security in the 1930 's or they withdraw completely and allow lower level governments to do the experiments and make the rules this is essentially what happened with welfare reform arguably the most successful public policy initiative of the last decade when neither of these things happens when one level of government simply dumps a problem on the level below it 's usually because underneath the bluster those at the top are clueless about what to do if federal officials had any clear idea how to improve the performance of american education they 'd be promoting it they would n't be telling state and local school systems to spend billions of dollars on standardized tests and then to punish the slackers and when governors and legislatures boast about holding the line on taxes but the truth is they are merely forcing higher taxes on those below that 's a form of weakness as well any mandate from above unaccompanied by the resources to help comply with it is a scary experience for those on the receiving end but it can also be an opportunity to experiment innovate and discover that there might be a way to get the job done more efficiently after all sometimes the forces at the top are n't quite as powerful as they had presumed that 's a lesson in federalism straight out of the old testament op ed contributor alan ehrenhalt is executive editor of governing magazine
