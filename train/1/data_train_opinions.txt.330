 to the editor frank rich 's characterization of historically black colleges and universities as a politically correct form of de facto segregation bonfire of the vanities column dec 21 is disturbing in its implications in at least two ways first it suggests that these institutions are segregated when in fact they have faculty and enroll students from all racial and ethnic backgrounds second it implies that they are worthy of support only for partisan political reasons not in their own right a great strength of american higher education is the diversity of types of institutions including those whose origins were based on serving particular groups like catholic university notre dame and brandeis historically black colleges and universities are part of this wonderfully diverse fabric i would recommend that mr rich reread another tom wolfe classic radical chic and be reminded that it is not only conservatives who can be racially insensitive walter e massey president morehouse college atlanta dec 23 2002
