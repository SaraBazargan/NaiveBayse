 to the editor children and adults around the world play with barbie dolls the question that comes to mind is how much barbie is enough i am 11 years old and i read in your newspaper a role model 's new clothes business day april 1 that barbie 's makers are trying to make a new image and that the image they are going for is barbie as a role model to me a role model is a person who is not perfect but who makes good decisions that children can follow barbie does not fit that description the image that barbie has is that if your body is not a remake of barbie 's body then you 're no good barbie is no role model barbie needs to get a makeover so that she looks somewhat normal before she can be a role model let 's remember we 're perfect just the way we are and barbie is just plastic kate cloud decatur ga april 1 2000
