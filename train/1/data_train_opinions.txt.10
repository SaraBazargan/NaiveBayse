 to the editor paul krugman column feb 27 suggests that market indexes like the dow jones industrial average are irrelevant for long term investors because the successful companies of the future may not even exist yet and are therefore unrepresented in any market index he says if you buy the dow you only buy a claim on the future earnings of the companies currently in the index that 's not a trivial distinction mr krugman is correct if i invest directly in the companies that make up the dow but if i invest using a mutual fund a fund tracking the dow gives me a stake in all the companies in the dow for as long as i hold it hence a long term investor need not speculate on the success of companies unborn he must predict only the index they will appear in andrew g biggs washington feb 28 2000 the writer is an analyst at the cato institute
