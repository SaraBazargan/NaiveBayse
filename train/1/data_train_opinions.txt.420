 the very rich are different from you and me scott fitzgerald wrote so we are being reminded these days by president bush 's tax bill the rich are the main beneficiaries of the bush bill the richest 1 percent of taxpayers would get 43 percent of the money from its provisions that comes to 40000 to 50000 per family the big gainers mostly voted for mr bush and are enthusiastic about his tax bill nothing surprising about that except for one thing the bill they support could undermine the prosperity that has brought them unexampled wealth the greatest economic boom in america 's history and the world 's came in the 1990 's what made it possible just about all the experts agree on the answer president clinton turned away from deficit spending and made it his prime objective to bring the federal budget into balance that enabled the federal reserve to keep interest rates low result the boom if all the tax cuts proposed by mr bush became law the government would likely go back into the red and interest rates rise that is the unpleasant reality that he has tried to conceal by what amounts to a verbal game of three card monte mr bush talks about his 16 trillion tax cut as my new york times colleague paul krugman first pointed out it is really 2 trillion when you count increased interest the government would have to pay on its debt other costs not mentioned by president bush would bring the figure to around 25 trillion to conceal the real impact of his legislation mr bush and his budget also used fancifully low estimates of spending he assumed there would be cuts in appropriations for such things as basic science and crime fighting which congress is unlikely to make he assumed that congress would hold the annual growth of discretionary spending to an unrealistic 4 percent the economist of london pointed out that he made no allowance for population growth and hence his budget implies a drop in real spending per citizen then there is the little matter of social security and medicare the bush budget assumes that their reserves can be diverted for other uses instead of being there for the baby boomers as they retire mr bush is just as slippery when he describes the effect of his legislation on taxpayers as he is when he discusses its impact on the budget his big theme is that the average taxpayer would save 1600 a year what percentage of american taxpayers would you guess would actually get less than that 50 percent no 88 percent of taxpayers would gain less than 1600 from the bush bill the financial times of london like the economist is a journal devoted to business and to economic realism the paper 's washington bureau chief gerard baker wrote this week instead of picking out the striving teacher in the gallery of the house of representatives last week it would have been more honest if mr bush had identified the grinning investment banker or multi billionaire land owner it is the intellectual dishonesty of this approach that is most distressing for some conservative ideologues the deception in presenting the tax plan is unimportant what matters to them is starving the federal government of revenue and thus forcing it to reduce its role they are not satisfied by the fact that federal spending as a share of gross domestic product has shrunk about 20 percent in the last decade most americans conservative or liberal want the federal government to do most of what it does they would like a tax cut but give that a lower priority according to surveys than safeguarding social security reducing the national debt and spending for domestic purposes generally to me the mystery is why non ideological conservatives men and women who have made their way in business and the professions should support the extravagant bush tax plan rather than a more cautious alternative sure they may save some thousands of dollars a year in the short run but they have so much at risk in a policy that calculatedly underestimates the cost of the tax cuts and endangers the hard won federal budget surplus that has opened the way to prosperity in the greek fable the goose laid a golden egg every day its owner wanting all the treasure at once killed the goose and looked inside he found the inside of a goose
