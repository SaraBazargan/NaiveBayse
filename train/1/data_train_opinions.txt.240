 the scandal over the sexual abuse of children by priests in boston and other american communities is a heartbreaking tragedy short of incest there is probably no sexual predator so damaging as a member of the clergy who chooses to betray young people 's trust instances of men of the cloth taking sexual advantage of children are by no means limited to massachusetts or to the roman catholic church but the current scandal in boston is exceptional both because of its scope and because of the determination with which the archdiocese 's authorities turned a blind eye a single priest john geoghan now defrocked has been accused of molesting more than 130 children over 30 years of service and was convicted recently in one case although the archdiocese was aware of numerous allegations against mr geoghan the priest continued to be transferred from parish to parish for decades often into jobs that put him in contact with children cardinal bernard law the venerable head of the boston archdiocese and the most senior leader of the catholic church in the united states has now moved to put in place a rigorous system for the identification evaluation and disposition of charges of sexual abuse by priests but cardinal law was far from proactive in dealing with the problem and he has rejected any suggestions that he step down noting that a bishop is not a corporate executive is not a politician catholics and non catholics alike have an interest in making sure that the church is watching for any illegal behavior among the priests it trains and employs they deserve some indication that the entire church power structure is responding with the utmost gravity to this issue cardinal law 's future is a matter for the cardinal and his superiors to handle but the voluntary retirement of so prominent a figure might be an appropriate way to demonstrate how seriously the church is taking this matter
