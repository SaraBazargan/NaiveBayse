 in the early 1990 's archaeologists from the university of arizona examined samples of household garbage in tucson on the monday after thanksgiving their purpose was to decipher the nature of the feast by deciphering the garbage as a scholar might examine the kitchen middens in the remains of an ancient village they broke each sample into a list of ingredients from faunal material turkey bones to beverage related items like the plastic ring from a six pack the hardest task these archaeologists faced was trying to draw conclusions only from the physical evidence as if they were not members of the culture that produced it most of us have been to thanksgivings where we feel like the archaeologist at the party who we wonder are these people how do their kinship structures work what is this strange food we 're eating probably somebody felt that way at tucson thanksgiving c45 120291 where the most numerous items in the garbage were paper plates 38 and cigarette filter tips 190 but the same feeling crops up at fancier parties too few things induce the archaeologist effect the feeling of standing well outside one 's culture faster than highly formalized food rituals which usually do n't involve paper plates but often do involve in laws and advanced arrays of cutlery you could sort through america 's thanksgiving garbage till new year 's and never deduce from it just why we celebrate this holiday it would be one thing if the day marked a real divergence from the american pattern of consumption ending months of barely enough with suddenly too much yet for most of us every day is a case of a little more than we need one student of feasts stipulates that they contain foods not generally served at daily meals for most americans however daily meals now include foods that never used to be served at daily meals by the standards of earlier eras every day is a feast day which is one way of saying that the very idea of a feast has begun to lose its meaning the pilgrim thanksgiving was a way of giving thanks not for plenty but for a sufficiency as for us we are better acquainted with too much than with enough today would be a good day to give thanks for just enough and to share the extra with those who lack even that much if we did we would all have more to be thankful for verlyn klinkenborg
