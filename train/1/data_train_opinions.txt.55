 to the editor re a weakened irs editorial april 16 the curbs and budget cuts imposed by congress on the internal revenue service were a response to an abusive agency that was hated by most of the public today the irs is a pleasure to deal with agents are polite and try to be helpful it is a welcome change if too many audits of the lower income groups still go on then action should be taken to reduce the number of those audits more important our system of income taxation has perhaps outlived its usefulness it remains too complicated and expensive to comply with a value added tax or similar system with proper protection for lower income groups may be more in line with the nature of our economy today and would do more to curb tax cheats than going back to the old days of expensive and abusive audits bruce neuman bridgehampton ny april 16 2000
