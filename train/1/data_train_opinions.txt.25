 to the editor re for democrats economy 's surge poses challenge front page nov 2 perhaps the real challenge to democrats over the economic surge is to find courage to tell it as it is to explain believable ideas for solutions comprehensibly and to convince people who should be voting americans need to hear that surges affecting some measurements of the economy will not bring economic stability especially to the middle class so long as corporations are dropping workers in america and contracting the work abroad we must expect this to continue so long as corporations gain great tax benefits as well as old fashioned profits perhaps the most formidable of the challenges will be to citizens who do n't believe that their vote matters or who suppose it makes no difference who wins the elections that is those who no longer believe that america is a democracy jan guardiano fort myers fla nov 2 2003
