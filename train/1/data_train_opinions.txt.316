 to the editor as a teacher who just finished his first year i read natalia mehlman 's june 24 op ed article my brief teaching career with mixed feelings i could sympathize with her difficulties as a first year new york city teacher friends who are first year teachers here have told me similar stories of administrators who are not supportive a dire shortage of materials and angry depressed and sometimes violent students but i took issue with the overall tone of hopelessness the situation in new york 's public schools is not always so horrible in my experience it has been rewarding and enjoyable i must admit that this is mainly because i teach in a small public school in brooklyn where the staff is very supportive and the students though from often stigmatized neighborhoods are intelligent respectful and fun to be around if more people had my kind of experience perhaps they would continue teaching heath madom brooklyn june 24 2002
