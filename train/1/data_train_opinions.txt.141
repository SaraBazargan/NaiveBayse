 to the editor re is there an audience for public diplomacy by kim andrew elliott op ed nov 16 i lived in china from 1979 to 1981 those were the days of empty libraries and sparse diversion the same five songs broadcast on loudspeakers each morning and tightly controlled western news media in fact there were none except for the voice of america i was not allowed off campus with any colleagues or students in the evenings after dinner small groups of students would visit me in my campus apartment where i was kept a virtual prisoner of privilege we 'd talk and invariably listen to voa it did n't matter what the actual story of the day was what mattered was their surprise at hearing ideas that differed from what they were being told about the west their pleasure with the different forms of music and their interest in the simple stories of america 's daily life they invariably noted when someone on the air disagreed with or questioned american leaders this glimpse into the freedom of thought was profound most of those students are now productive citizens of the united states with their own intellectually alive children in american colleges questioning authority gretchen dykstra new york nov 16 2002
