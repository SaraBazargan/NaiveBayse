 the bush administration did the right thing on diesel emissions this week curbing an important source of air pollution yet george bush has in general reneged on the environmental promises of his 2000 campaign most notably he broke his campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide emissions offering instead a purely voluntary and therefore one might have thought meaningless plan to limit global warming but even this it turns out was too much for mr bush 's party the energy bill passed by house republicans last week did n't include any plan even a voluntary one to limit greenhouse emissions why the answer i believe has to do with an aversion to all things global on its face the bush plan on global warming was a sham relying on the kindness of corporations the department of energy would have issued credits to companies that reduced carbon dioxide emissions but since there would have been no legal limits those credits would simply have been a symbolic recognition of good behavior or would they right wing think tanks engaged in a concerted and successful campaign to persuade congress to reject the bush scheme those think tanks argued that keeping track of emission reductions would make it easier for a future administration to introduce a real global warming policy companies that had accumulated credits might favor measures that gave those credits some value more broadly they opposed any legitimization of the idea that global warming is a problem but why would that be such a bad thing from their point of view we can safely dismiss the idea that the right has carefully weighed the scientific evidence and concluded that the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is wrong we can also dismiss the idea that conservatives have carefully examined the economics of emission controls and concluded that they are too expensive so was it just politics as usual opposition to a global warming policy partly reflects a general aversion to government regulation do n't forget that tom delay the house majority leader is a former exterminator who entered politics because he was angry about controls on pesticide use but the ferocity with which the right opposes any policy to limit greenhouse gases even the nearly empty bush plan goes beyond general anti environmentalism what 's different about global warming i think is that unlike local pollution dealing with it requires concerted action by governments around the world and that 's what the right really ca n't stand this should n't be surprising there was a time when us conservatives were isolationists nobody thinks that 's a viable position nowadays but the same impulses an assertion of moral superiority an unwillingness to consider alternative points of view lie behind america 's new spirit of unilateralism we obviously ca n't ignore the world but many americans reject the idea that other countries should have any say over what we do but what happens when unilateralists encounter problems that clearly require the cooperation of other countries not as junior partners but as equals right now the answer is simply to deny the existence of those problems the greenhouse effect is a quintessentially global issue fine we 'll deny that global warming exists fighting stateless terrorists demands a global cooperative effort fine we 'll fight terrorism by launching a conventional war against a regime that nasty as it was had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks eventually of course and sooner rather than later this attempt to deny reality will fail while we 've been watching the iraq show many past achievements of us foreign policy have been disintegrating through neglect and arrogance the united states has squandered the good will it built up in latin america in the 1990 's for half a century the us has regarded the drive toward free trade as a key part of its global strategy now trade negotiations are falling apart from lack of attention even in iraq we 're starting to see that winning the war was the easy part and us officials previously dismissive of old europe are suddenly talking about an international peacekeeping force but to be effective such a force like the one in afghanistan would surely have to include french and german soldiers the truth is that we ca n't go it alone but by the time that truth sinks in there may be a lot of pieces to pick up e mail krugman nytimescom
