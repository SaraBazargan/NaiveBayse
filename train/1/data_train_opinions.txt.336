 to the editor re violence that wo n't let go by bob herbert column aug 27 a study by the department of justice concluded that nearly 70 percent of rape victims knew their attackers yet the widespread belief is that the only rapist a woman needs to fear will be found lurking behind bushes or in dark parking garages the unfortunate reality is that a woman is more than twice as likely to be raped by a family member or friend than a stranger the downplaying of acquaintance rape in the media leads the public to believe that this kind of sexual assault is an uncommon phenomenon this belief makes victims afraid to come forward as they fear that they wo n't be believed or even worse will be blamed for what happened while stranger rape is a very significant and frightening reality it is not the reality for most rape victims alison altman washington aug 27 2001
