 to the editor i regularly disagree with william safire but this time he is right on the button in challenging the prosecution of martha stewart for lying fight it martha column june 12 i recall as a young air force lawyer prosecuting even younger airmen and charging them with stealing a modestly priced radio but including a much more serious charge of lying to the air policeman investigating the case thereby trying to open the door to a bad conduct discharge i have since regretted such prosecutorial excess and hope that ms stewart 's prosecutor will see the light joseph h guttentag washington june 12 2003
