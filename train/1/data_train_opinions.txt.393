 the world needs both more electricity and less pollution the goals are not incompatible but the solution will require better management of demand smarter use of coal as well as renewable energy sources and increased use of nuclear power as congress considers an energy bill when it returns from recess it will be under pressure to expand or limit the use of nuclear power the issue however is not simple more nuclear power will be necessary but more nuclear plants will be built only if more safeguards and incentives are put in place the challenge is to make nuclear energy safer cleaner and more economical we built a model to compare the costs of producing electricity from new nuclear coal and natural gas plants the model focuses on economic cost not regulated or subsidized cost according to our study the baseline cost of new nuclear power is 67 cents per kilowatt hour compared to 42 cents for coal and natural gas when the price of gas is 450 per thousand cubic feet plausible but unproved technology could reduce nuclear costs to those of coal and gas however if a cost is assigned to carbon emissions either through a tax or some other way as in a current congressional proposal that would limit emissions but allow companies to buy and sell the right to discharge more pollutants nuclear power could become an attractive economic option for example a 50 per ton carbon value about the cost of capturing and separating the carbon dioxide product of coal and natural gas combustion raises the cost of coal to 54 cents and natural gas to 48 cents even under these favorable circumstances the regulatory uncertainty threatening the large scale investment needed for a nuclear plant will require some government assistance a production tax credit similar to that extended to wind power is a good idea it would give private investors an incentive to complete a plant if no plant is built and operated no public money is spent if the first plants are indeed built and operated competitively more will follow and the possibility of reducing greenhouse gases increases besides cost there is the problem of nuclear waste while it is technically possible to dispose of spent fuel safely the issue is actually doing it successful operation of the planned yucca mountain repository in nevada would be an important step but the department of energy 's nuclear waste research and development program should consider solutions beyond mined depositories like yucca mountain for example burying spent fuel several kilometers deep in a dry well called a borehole may offer significant cost and environmental benefits compared to mined repositories this and other possibilities should be systematically explored finally there is the challenge of nonproliferation which is complex because of its international dimensions there is no question that the current nonproliferation regime needs to be strengthened particular attention must be paid to enrichment technology and reprocessing enrichment which converts natural uranium into reactor fuel can produce uranium well beyond reactor grade suitable for weapons reprocessing separates plutonium metal which can be used directly in weapons from reactor fuel there is ample uranium available so that reprocessing can be avoided for at least the next 50 years in the near term the priority should be to require signatories to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty like iran to accept inspections of suspected but undeclared nuclear facilities for the longer term advanced nations that operate nuclear facilities should offer to provide fuel to reactors in less developed nations and to remove all spent fuel nuclear power can make an important contribution to meeting the world 's growing electricity needs while helping to reduce carbon emissions but this contribution will be realized only if the united states and other nations focus on making today 's technology work and avoid expensive advanced technologies that involve reprocessing which presents serious proliferation risks it will be difficult of course to carry forward this nuclear agenda yet it will also be difficult to limit greenhouse gas emissions adequately while satisfying global energy needs for social and economic development in both of these endeavors american leadership is essential op ed contributor john deutch professor of chemistry at mit and former director of central intelligence was in the energy department from 1977 to 1980 ernest moniz professor of physics at mit was in the energy department from 1997 to 2001 they directed a recent mit study on nuclear energy
