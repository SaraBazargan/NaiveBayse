 to the editor re invective 's comeback by william safire column april 28 it is often all too easy to place government officials and policy makers on a pedestal of sorts expecting consistent brilliance and inhuman foresight from them by giving us a few heat of the moment teasers from some of america 's top officials mr safire reminds readers that their leaders are also normal people who when provoked occasionally resort to childish vigorous vituperation just as the rest of us do these quips not only remind us of their humanity but also keep politics interesting and personal so three cheers for a few more vituperations from our best and brightest cristi hillis davidson nc april 28 2003
