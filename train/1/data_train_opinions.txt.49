 to the editor re the presidential pen editorial aug 8 i for one am looking forward to bill clinton 's book and hope that it includes very few words about monica s lewinsky and many about his foreign policy initiatives we seemed much closer to living in a peaceful world where problems between countries were addressed through negotiations where our power was used in helpful even modest ways not assuming we had all the answers i want to hear his views about foreign leaders and his efforts to rescue the economy being quickly undone by the current resident of the white house and i want to hear more about how he chose to deal with the right wingers working against him a highly intelligent president with a deep and broad world view will have a lot to tell us jane levy troy new york aug 8 2001
