 during the 2000 election many journalists deluded themselves and their audience into believing that there were n't many policy differences between the major candidates and focused on personalities or rather perceptions of personalities instead this time there can be no illusions president bush has turned this country sharply to the right and this election will determine whether the right 's takeover is complete but will the coverage of the election reflect its seriousness toward that end i hereby propose some rules for 2004 political reporting do n't talk about clothes al gore 's endorsement of howard dean was a momentous event the man who won the popular vote in 2000 threw his support to a candidate who accuses the president of wrongfully taking the nation to war so what did some prominent commentators write about why the fact that both men wore blue suits this was not alas unusual i do n't know why some journalists seem so concerned about politicians clothes as opposed to say their policy proposals but unless you 're a fashion reporter obsessing about clothes is an insult to your readers intelligence actually look at the candidates policy proposals one key proposal in the state of the union address will we hear be the creation of new types of tax exempt savings accounts the proposal will come wrapped in fine phrases about an ownership society but serious journalists should tell us how the plan would work who would benefit and who would lose an early version of the plan was floated almost a year ago and carefully analyzed in the journal tax notes so there 's no excuse for failing to report that the plan would probably reduce not increase national savings that it would have large long run budget costs and that its benefits would go mainly to the wealthiest few percent of the population beware of personal anecdotes anecdotes that supposedly reveal a candidate 's character are a staple of political reporting but they should carry warning labels for one thing there are lots of anecdotes and it 's much too easy to report only those that reinforce the reporter 's prejudices the approved story line about mr bush is that he 's a bluff honest plain spoken guy and anecdotes that fit that story get reported but if the conventional wisdom were instead that he 's a phony a silver spoon baby who pretends to be a cowboy journalists would have plenty of material to work with if a reporter must use anecdotes they 'd better be true after the dean endorsement innumerable reporters cracked jokes about al gore 's inventing the internet guys he never said that it 's a malicious distortion of a true statement and no self respecting journalist would repeat it look at the candidates records a close look at mr bush 's record as governor would have revealed that the approved story line notwithstanding he was no moderate a close look at mr dean 's record in vermont reveals that the emerging story line notwithstanding he is no radical he was a fiscally conservative leader whose biggest policy achievement nearly universal health insurance for children was the result of incremental steps do n't fall for political histrionics i could n't believe how much ink was spilled after the gore dean event over joe lieberman 's hurt feelings folks we 're talking about war peace and the future of us democracy not about who takes whom to the prom political operatives have become experts at manufacturing the appearance of outrage in the last few weeks the usual suspects have been trying to paint howard dean 's obviously heartfelt comments about his brother 's death in laos as some sort of insult to the military we owe it to our readers not to fall for these tricks it 's not about you we learn from the washington post that reporters covering mr dean are surprised and it 's implied miffed that he never asks a single question about them the mind reels i do n't really expect my journalistic colleagues to follow these rules no doubt i myself in moments of weakness will break one or more of them but history will not forgive us if we allow laziness and personal pettiness to shape this crucial election e mail krugman nytimescom
