 to the editor re death is different editorial april 10 having handled criminal appeals for 35 years throughout the country i am convinced that those who face the death penalty often secure a better level of justice than others within the criminal justice system in many states more qualified lawyers are appointed to represent death penalty defendants and more seasoned prosecutors are more reluctant to proceed unless they have a higher quality of evidence not deemed necessary in other cases it is easier to persuade law students to work on a death penalty case and to secure volunteers from large law firms to give their time pro bono in death penalty cases judges review the cases with greater care and errors that may have affected the evidence are considered more significant in death penalty cases if as you report a hundred innocent people were facing death in this country since 1973 think of the hundreds of thousands of innocent people who received other albeit lesser sentences on the basis of a broken system nathan z dershowitz new york april 15 2002
