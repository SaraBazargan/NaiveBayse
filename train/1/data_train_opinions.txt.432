 the senate judiciary committee is expected to vote this week on president bush 's nomination of judge d brooks smith to the third circuit court of appeals in philadelphia we have serious concerns about judge smith 's interpretation of the constitution his fairness in employment discrimination and other cases against large companies and his judicial ethics we urge the committee to reject his nomination as a trial judge judge smith has been reversed by the third circuit the court he now seeks to join more than 50 times too often it has been for wrongly dismissing the claims of workers and consumers in one overturned ruling he threw out an age discrimination case filed by a factory worker on timeliness grounds although the worker had made the 300 day deadline from the time he was dismissed judge smith counted back from the day he had received a poor performance evaluation in another case in which he was reversed judge smith was too quick to throw out a suit by the parents of a 15 month old child who choked to death on what the parents alleged was a dangerous toy he has taken an extremely narrow view of congress 's power to legislate under the commerce clause which has often been used to pass laws protecting civil rights if the commerce clause were reduced to what judge smith says the founders intended little more than an authorization to eliminate trade barriers blacks women and other groups that have relied on the protections afforded them under the mainstream interpretation of the clause would be stripped of important rights equally troubling is judge smith 's expansive reading of the fifth amendment 's takings clause which is increasingly popular with property owners challenging health and safety and environmental regulations in a case involving the coal industry retiree health benefit act judge smith ruled that forcing a company to pay benefits that retired miners had rightfully earned would constitute an illegal taking of the company 's property an interpretation other courts have roundly rejected judge smith 's record also contains significant ethical lapses one case that he presided over for a time and issued orders in involved a bank in which his wife was an officer and in which he and his wife had 100000 or more in stock under federal law he had an obligation to recuse himself since his impartiality might reasonably be questioned when judge smith was up for confirmation to the trial court he conceded that his membership in the all male spruce creek rod and gun club violated the code of conduct for judges and promised the senate that if he was unable to persuade it to open its doors to women he would resign instead he remained in the club for more than a decade although it continued all that time to discriminate judge smith 's defenders accuse senate democrats of wanting to reject or delay acting on all of president bush 's nominees judiciary committee members should not be intimidated by those charges the fact is the senate has quietly confirmed 57 nominees since last july including nine for federal appeals courts the concern about judge smith is not that he is a bush nominee but that his record shows him to be unqualified for the appellate bench his nomination should be rejected
