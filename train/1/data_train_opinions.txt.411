 after a summer in which it seemed as if harvey pitt might be getting religion on accounting reforms he has now reverted to form mr pitt chairman of the securities and exchange commission is on the verge of botching one of its most pressing missions the creation of a credible oversight board for the accounting profession mr pitt appears to be having second thoughts about appointing as board chairman john biggs the respected tiaa cref pension fund manager who has long favored tightening accounting practices mr biggs is precisely the kind of tough minded leader who should be put in charge of the panel the objections to mr biggs from the accounting industry and its defenders on capitol hill only confirm his suitability for the post mr biggs has been a strong proponent of barring auditors from doing any consulting and requiring companies to rotate their auditors he was among the early proponents of forcing companies to treat executive stock options as a compensation expense affecting the bottom line creation of the independent five member board empowered to set standards for accountants was the centerpiece of the reform bill approved by congress this summer one that republican house leaders and the bush administration only belatedly supported after a slew of accounting scandals that contributed to the stock market 's meltdown having failed to prevent passage of the law the accounting lobby is now maneuvering to keep serious reformers off the oversight board the new board must play a strong role in restoring investors faith in the integrity of financial markets it will have broad discretion to set ethics rules such as conflict of interest standards for accountants auditing public companies and assign extensive disciplinary powers to enforce them the board will also review the performance of the major accounting firms this regulatory body 's creation is a direct response to the glaring conflicts of interest that accounting firms had been engaging in and to the industry 's notoriously weak history of disciplining its own if harvey pitt wants to retain sufficient credibility to stay on the job he should hasten to name mr biggs or someone of his caliber as chairman of the accounting oversight board
