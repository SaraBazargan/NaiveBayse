 to the editor re blinded by science week in review july 14 science is outrunning science fiction that cry has been heard repeatedly over the years it has never turned out to be true for the simple reason that by the time some idea long used in science fiction is turned into reality by scientists and engineers some of them science fiction writers themselves on the side science fiction has moved on by the time neil armstrong set foot on the moon in 1969 for instance travel to the moon was passe in sf writers had moved on to stories about interplanetary or interstellar voyages we can confidently expect that to continue as long as science itself continues to advance every step forward by science or technology hints at further steps that may lie ahead and as long as that is so science fiction will never be left behind eric b lipps staten island july 14 2002
