 to the editor re bush defends sale of stock and vows to enhance sec front page july 9 where were the democrats and president bill clinton while these abuses in corporate america were being committed it is hard to believe that this issue is a legitimate one for the democratic party the abuses took place over a much longer period than the 18 months that president bush has been in office it is time to forget the notion that simply being a democrat makes a person immune to greed and always for the little guy the reality is that in the 90 's there was nobody who cared or wanted the ride to end otherwise the abuses would have been stopped sooner closing thought to politicians set your political differences aside and ensure that this does not happen again or you will have only yourselves to blame ken lambert seattle july 9 2002
