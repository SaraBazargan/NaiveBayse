 any mention of the new international criminal court in washington these days seems to guarantee an ugly overreaction the bush administration and congress have rushed to outdo each other in bullying the 77 countries that have already agreed to take part in the court including some of america 's closest allies forgotten in this frenzy is the court 's desirable goal of bringing international war criminals to justice and its substantial protections against abusive prosecutions ignoring these realities washington prefers to brandish its military and economic power to coerce other countries into exempting all americans in advance from the court 's jurisdiction in the latest gambit the state department last week warned countries participating in the court that they could be denied united states military assistance unless they sign agreements shielding american personnel from the court 's authority this threat written into the latest big antiterrorism spending bill by tom delay the house majority whip does not apply to nato members and several other close allies and mr bush has the power to waive it entirely regrettably he has n't the same legislation grants the white house permission to use all means including military force to free americans held under the court 's authority this page shares washington 's desire that no innocent american peacekeeper aid worker or diplomat get caught up in a politically motivated international prosecution but that is already assured by treaty provisions that limit the court 's jurisdiction to war crimes genocide and crimes against humanity and let it proceed only when national courts fail to prosecute the court is designed to ensure that a future slobodan milosevic saddam hussein or muammar el qaddafi can not evade justice by manipulating his country 's legal system it is not designed to frame americans on trumped up charges washington gains nothing by antagonizing longstanding allies the reasonable american policy would be to join the court and help it achieve its purposes which square with longstanding american goals as well though that will not happen soon at the very least the administration and congress should respect the sovereign right of other countries to join the court without being subjected to american pressure
