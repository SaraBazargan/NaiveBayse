 dr martin luther king jr received the nobel peace prize at the age of 35 when most people are still struggling to find out who they are by the time of his assassination four years later he had played the starring role in a movement for racial justice that transformed the country and caused him to be spoken of in the same breath as figures like abraham lincoln thomas jefferson and mohandas gandhi what might dr king have done with 40 more years he might have returned to his church and lived out his days as a minister he might have taken a professorship at his beloved boston university where he earned a doctoral degree and deposited many of his personal papers he might even have run for congress to continue the civil rights campaign in which he had played a crucial role since his first days as a preacher during the montgomery bus boycott in 1955 one thing seems certain dr king would not have lent his name to a disney style amusement park like the one his son dexter once proposed building in the area surrounding the king center for nonviolent social change in atlanta that plan was shelved after the civil rights establishment cried foul but the king family has continued along a distressing path that has made it increasingly difficult for historians teachers and journalists to circulate dr king 's words and ideas while making his name image and voice readily available to commercial enterprises americans grieved with the kings when the great civil rights leader was slain the country continues to feel sympathy for a wife who lost a husband and children who grew up fatherless but dr king 's admirers were understandably shocked upon hearing a piece of his immortal i have a dream speech free at last free at last sandwiched between the voices of homer simpson and kermit the frog in a tv commercial for a cellular phone company another advertisement by the french communications business alcatel manipulates footage of the 1963 march on washington so that the crowd that had gathered to listen to the i have a dream speech disappears from the scene leaving dr king preaching to a vacant washington mall the king estate started down this road 20 years ago in what seemed like a reasonable attempt to control martin luther king jr 's image so that it would be used only in authorized and appropriately dignified ways somewhere along the way the family became more interested in profit than dignity instead of protecting dr king against commercialization it began suing or dunning people who use his best known words and ideas in scholarly or journalistic enterprises one of the first targets was the distinguished documentarian henry hampton who featured dr king to noble effect in his landmark film eyes on the prize the family wanted money and the right to dictate how dr king 's likeness was used eventually mr hampton filed a lawsuit arguing that the family 's threats and demands for exorbitant payments had a chilling effect on free speech the suit was settled out of court the family has been relentless in its attempts to corner the market on dr king 's words historians all over the country were frightened when the king family sued boston university in an attempt to get it to return 85000 documents that he had deposited in the university archives during the 1960 's the most depressing example of misplaced values occurred recently when the king national memorial project foundation a not for profit organization began raising money for a 100 million memorial that is planned for the mall in washington its backers hope to place a memorial to dr king between those of lincoln and jefferson celebrating the role the civil rights leader played in realizing the democratic ideals that were first enunciated by the founding fathers and moved forward by lincoln in the emancipation proclamation the plans for this memorial which would be the first to honor a black american on the mall have been complicated by the king family 's failure to grant what it is calling a permissions agreement to the memorial foundation the king center in atlanta has issued a statement expressing concern that corporate sponsors of the memorial drive might try to connect their products with dr king in some untasteful way but the possibility that a corporate sponsor might degrade the march on washington and dr king 's i have a dream speech as much as his family has seems remote indeed money seems to be a more central concern the king center 's managing director tricia harris suggested to the washington post that the center was seeking a fee from the memorial foundation in order to offset money that the center might lose as a result of the memorial foundation 's fund raising the news of the dispute between the kings and the memorial foundation has already spawned hesitation among potential donors americans who love dr king and value his contribution to the national history have been appalled for years at the way the king center has placed profits above the national good with respect to martin luther king 's legacy dr king did not live long enough to provide as well for the family he left behind as he would have wished but his words his voice and his story belong to history not only to his family the possibility that the family might regard this heritage in terms of dollars and cents alone is just heartbreaking it cuts against everything that dr king tried to teach us
