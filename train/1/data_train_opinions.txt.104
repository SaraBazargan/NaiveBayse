 friends couch potatoes countrymen lend me your eyes i come not to bury eisner but to praise him sure eisner is ambitious to keep the disney coffers filled and yes koppel is an honorable man but who are we kidding spare me the deification of tv news the air is absurdly thick with dudgeon and broadcast hotshots will no doubt find fresh outrage in the fact that it took a comedian to stay ted koppel 's execution everyone has painted michael eisner as cruella de vil trying to take the precious puppy known as abc news and turn it into a flashy polka dot wrap he is the philistine who 's stomping on the hallowed halls of journalism trying to junk the estimable nightline for the ka ching of late night jokes still the bitter donnybrook between disney and abc news is not as black and white as steamboat willie it is simplistic to cast it as the noble crusade of journalism versus the crass demands of commerce bread versus circuses even though mr eisner and robert iger treated mr koppel shabbily they were embracing the same objectives that network news divisions have been embracing for years they were simply taking the game to the next level in a way nightline is like that little house that always got in the way of some big new casino going up in atlantic city donald trump or somebody would offer a fortune to tear it down and the owner would put up a fight on principle nightline is a lonely holdout with a strong commitment to journalistic principles and mature anchors whose features still move much of tv news had already become part of the big casino supplanting edward r murrow and walter cronkite with neon and showgirls news executives have been racing to tart up the news with pretty faces in leather coats soft and sexy stories and promos for prime time shows brazenly masquerading as legitimate news features they obsess over the talents q ratings the way hollywood suits obsess over the weekend box office rankings otherwise why pay katie couric 65 million bucks to perk why zoom the camera in on paula zahn 's lips and advertise her as sexy why celebrate greta van susteren for remaking her face david westin the abc news president has been agonizing over the fate of ted koppel going ashen faced at one meeting and declaring that a letterman usurpation would be a tremendous blow against the news division but is n't this the same guy who sent leonardo dicaprio to interview president clinton about the environment and the same guy who 's been grooming george stephanopoulos the former clinton aide who was deemed as cuddly and doe eyed as a disney character by new york magazine and claire shipman the former nbc it girl on the white house beat to bump off sam cokie and shoot for a younger audience for its sunday public affairs program if tv news were that high toned would n't the impressive andrea mitchell have her own show instead of the zany ashleigh banfield and her glasses and would n't brian ross be trussed up in a leather coat doing sizzle news on downtown 20 20 instead of chris cuomo if network news were all about excellent journalism would n't tim russert and candy crowley be the anchors in waiting instead there 's a queue of pretty boy pod people in the wings on the off chance the evening news manages to survive the departure of tom dan and peter mr westin sees himself as the righteous shield keeping mr eisner from censoring all the stories about the disney company but like all tv news executives he has been infusing glib entertainment values into the news division for years so he can not now act shocked shocked when his bosses take the next step and decide to bump a news show for entertainment mr westin has discovered why you should never negotiate with hostage takers if you give a mouse a cookie it will want a glass of milk e mail liberties nytimescom
