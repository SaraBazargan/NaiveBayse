 to the editor i admire both president elect george w bush and vice president al gore for their efforts to unite this nation after the questionable decision by the supreme court front page dec 14 this admiration is doubled for mr gore as he clearly had every right to be bitter both men at the end clearly put the fate of the nation above partisan politics in contrast there are those including the news media who will seek to obtain and count the disputed ballots in florida if they succeed and mr gore is shown to be the winner it will do great damage to our nation as a trial lawyer for 20 years i have won and i have lost i have learned that whatever the outcome we must move on i urge those who wish to cause further damage to our nation to reconsider and follow the admirable statesmanship of mr gore when mr bush leaves office there will be ample time for historians to determine who really won this election keith d nowak middletown nj dec 14 2000
