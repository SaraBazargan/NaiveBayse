 to the editor re paying for a disability diagnosis to gain time on college boards front page sept 26 my husband and i are parents of two children who have received diagnoses of learning disabilities since early elementary school we have aggressively sought and gratefully received help from their schools every week we have appointments for aiding us and them in dealing with their disabilities we have chosen schools that will accommodate them and yet have them in fully mainstreamed activities yes we are among the financially lucky westchester county group covered in the article and yes we are thrilled that now our children 's sat scores will not have an asterisk beside them on college applications we are disgusted that any parents would have their child tested at the last minute just to get a little more time on the sat but people have always had to live with others who act immorally the good that the college board 's decision will do for the many kids with true disabilities far outweighs the bad of the few who will cheat louise anlyan harris pound ridge ny sept 26 2002
