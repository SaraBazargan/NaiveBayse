 hockey is at once an elegant and punishing sport where a crushing but legal body check is as much a part of the game 's tactical ebb and flow as a crisply executed pass the game 's furious pace and frequent collisions also lead to fistfights relished by some spectators condemned by others as an unnecessary intrusion but everyone agrees that deliberate violence inflicted on an unprotected opponent should be severely sanctioned the national hockey league was therefore right to throw the book at the boston bruins marty mcsorley wielding his stick with both hands mcsorley struck vancouver 's donald brashear from behind sending brashear to the hospital with a concussion mcsorley was suspended for the rest of the season and will forfeit 72000 in salary the suspension was the longest in league history for an on ice infraction the vancouver police are also investigating to see whether mcsorley should be charged with assault the culture of professional hockey at least in north america has long tolerated a certain level of thuggery which means that it has also tolerated players like mcsorley mcsorley has made a good living as an enforcer protecting star players like wayne gretzky against opposing roughnecks but the line between controlled aggressiveness and gratuitous violence is very thin and mcsorley has crossed it before this was his seventh career suspension and his fifth for a stick related foul even mcsorley seemed astounded by his behavior saying i 'm still in shock at what i did which is another way of saying that even by the nhl 's permissive standards some things including assault with a potentially deadly weapon require both league sanctions and a police inquiry
