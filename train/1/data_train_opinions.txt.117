 to the editor the justice department 's decision to disobey a court order based on the claim of national security allowing zacarias moussaoui to question an accuser us will defy court 's order in terror case front page july 15 is an abomination and a signal of this administration 's disregard for the principles on which this nation was founded the very idea of tossing out the months of work put into the federal case for a military tribunal for which the administration wrote the rules and in which many rights would be forfeited is outrageous this is indeed a question of national security but the justice department has it backward the true threat to the security of this nation 's people occurs when the government willingly disregards the very principles of justice that are the bedrock of america michael j fedor elizabethtown pa july 15 2003
