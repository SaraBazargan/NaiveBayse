 to the editor being texan i took great interest in of barbecue and men by brent staples the city life july 31 my 10 gallon hat goes off to mr staples for his dedication to the grill but that 's not why i wrote no i 'm afraid i have a much more serious concern mr staples was on the mark until he made the egregious and unfortunately all too common mistake of discussing barbecue sauce barbecue sauce despite its name has no place in barbecue the proof is evident if you have a perfectly grilled piece of meat the addition of sauce can only diminish it now i know this issue is debatable but being texan i do n't really need to justify my beliefs to anyone but my pappy so do not defile your barbecue with so called barbecue sauce your taste buds will thank you and your texan friends will shake your hand with a new enthusiasm ashley williams falls church va july 31 2003
