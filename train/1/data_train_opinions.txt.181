 to the editor regarding george w bush 's proposed tax cut front page march 1 i routinely conduct a nonscientific experiment by asking people if they cheat on their income taxes over the last 25 years i have been stunned to find that not only do virtually all of the people i ask admit to cheating usually by overreporting expenses or not reporting cash income but they are also proud of the fact that they have beaten the system and kept their money until i see more people embracing the spirit of a democracy i do n't think americans deserve a tax break john williams new york march 1 2001
