 beleaguered citizens trapped in the war zone of an endless presidential election may find it hard to believe but come jan 20 either george w bush or al gore will take office we thought it might be useful to leap ahead and take a look at what awaits a new president and congress any speculation must start with the reality that two candidates with very different personalities and visions produced an evenly divided electorate similarly democratic and republican legislative candidates offering very different approaches to domestic issues led to a house and senate with only a slight edge for the gop one question that hovers over all this is what kind of washington the public really wants another is whether all this conflict and division will set the stage for ceaseless partisan conflict or inspire a new search from moderates on both sides for a bipartisan balance point many worry that the bitterness of the presidential contest will hang over whichever candidate wins the electoral vote one hopeful sign a bare one was the gore campaign 's decision friday to dial back its threats of litigation over the florida results the bush campaign blustered unattractively about retaliatory ballot challenges in other close states and yesterday sought a federal court injunction to prevent a manual recount in some florida counties we have declared our strong preference for a prompt dignified non litigious resolution to the presidential election but however or whenever the end comes the questions remain about what kind of political world we will all inhabit to state the obvious this would be a good time for all sides including the leadership of congress to step back and think about delivering something that even those voters caught up in the heat of the moment would probably welcome an easing of the recrimination and warfare in american politics the harbingers are admittedly not great in congress under the senate majority leader trent lott republicans have been willing to tolerate shrinkage of their senate majority as the price of maintaining a reflexive ideological ferocity even now faced with the possibility of a tie in the senate mr lott has stuck to his old ways by joking tastelessly about the possibility of lightning striking hillary rodham clinton before she joins him in the capitol as tom daschle the minority leader said the senate rules are such that nothing can be done in that body without cooperation across the aisles that is doubly true if this turns out to be a senate that has 50 democrats and 50 republicans and the vice president has to be called in to break ties these factors plus mr lott 's bellicosity make it unlikely that the senate could spark a new comity prospects may be better in the house where the gop clings to the thinnest majority since the 1950 's the speaker dennis hastert has leadership potential if he can break free of fire eaters like tom delay last session he worked with president clinton and the democrats on issues including trade with china but the best chance for real progress will be the white house notwithstanding that half of the voters will be unhappy with whoever moves in mr gore or mr bush would have to try to govern from the center on some issues it will be difficult to find a middle ground but the precarious equilibrium created by voters in congress has also created an opportunity mr bush may have seen this possibility before the election when he said he would be the kind of president who would work with democrats to bring about medicare reform a prescription drug benefit and an overhaul of social security mr gore was more combative but as a senator from tennessee he reached out to republicans on foreign policy issues and he has the experience to practice the almost forgotten presidential skill of charming the opposition the next president will face a mandate problem that will force him toward tactics different from those of recent winners president reagan used his 1980 landslide to push an ambitious program of tax cuts and he picked up the support of democrats who either agreed with him or were scared to defy him although receiving only 43 percent of the popular vote in 1992 president clinton was perceived as having a mandate on health care until his legislative effort hit the skids for lack of consultation with congress one test for the next president will be to consult with key members no matter what obstacles mr lott and like minded battlers may erect our guess is that whoever wins the white house the public will let him try to lead despite lingering unhappiness over the election from woodrow wilson to john f kennedy to mr clinton american presidents have won pluralities and gone on to lead effectively if they communicated with the public and worked with congress after the spectacle of events in florida last week americans should be ready for a respite from the fratricidal politics of the last several years
