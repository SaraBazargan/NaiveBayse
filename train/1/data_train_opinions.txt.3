 congress 's main budget adviser has looked years into the future and concluded that the nation can not afford its overheated present as republicans continue cutting taxes enriching spending and rolling ever larger debts a decade over the horizon fiscal autopilot is not an option warned douglas holtz eakin director of the congressional budget office in a no nonsense estimate of serial budget imbalances to come unless the deficit and tax cut happy congress begins to put the brakes on now future americans will most likely be caught in an impossible crunch of historically higher taxes and plummeting health care and retirement benefits mr holtz eakin concluded in his forecast the cost of social security medicare and medicaid inevitably must eat up a sharply increasing chunk of the nation 's economic output as baby boomers retire and people live longer said mr holtz eakin a former bush adviser they will face more expensive health care with fewer active workers to help pay the escalating costs he said with short term economic indicators finally on the rebound no incumbent republican is likely to applaud these warnings they are about problems that will effectively reach a crisis beyond the careers of the very politicians who are most responsible for them but world markets in which the dollar is steadily declining against the euro are already showing a deepening suspicion about president bush 's policy of budgeting by deficit and debt congress should heed mr holtz eakin 's message that moving sooner is better than moving later
