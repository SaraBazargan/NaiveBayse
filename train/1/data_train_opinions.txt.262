 to the editor i enjoyed making the rocks speak harriman park becoming center for geology tourism news article july 25 about the efforts of dr alexander e gates of rutgers university to unravel the geology at harriman state park in new york but i 'm a little baffled by dr gates 's statement that geotourism is a relatively new phenomenon i 've been a geotourist for more than 30 years i believe that the adventurers who climbed mount vesuvius in classical times to witness the eruptions could properly be called geotourists it 's not a new concept to anyone interested in rocks and geology in fact it 's as old as the hills mark w garrett winter park fla july 25 2002
