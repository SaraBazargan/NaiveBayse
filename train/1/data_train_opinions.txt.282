 the clinton administration released projections last week showing that the estimated federal surplus will hit 5 trillion over the next 10 years almost 1 trillion more than previously expected supporters of president elect george w bush say that the bigger surplus now expected will provide the wherewithal to pass mr bush 's proposed 19 trillion tax cut which the bush team believes is needed to spur an economy that is slowing down but a careful look at the numbers shows that the bush plan remains a bad fiscal idea start with the fact that 25 trillion of the projected surplus comes from social security and another 500 billion or so comes from medicare both pots of money are essentially off limits congress appears committed to using the extra money from these programs to pay down the federal debt a use that does not affect the solvency of either program but does improve the overall health of the future economy so that leaves only about 2 trillion of the projected 5 trillion surplus for tax cuts and new government spending but fiscal matters are not nearly as rosy as the new estimates suggest the white house projections assume that federal programs other than social security medicare and medicaid will not expand over the next decade that is unrealistic the cost of making likely additions to defense capabilities and to some domestic programs and of preserving popular tax credits that are scheduled to expire would eat up an additional 600 billion or more out of the surplus that would leave only 14 trillion available for tax cuts and all other spending increases mr bush 's overly generous tax cut plan would wipe out virtually the entire remaining surplus that would leave him no money to help as he has promised low income families buy health insurance which could cost 600 billion over 10 years or to add prescription drugs to medicare which could cost 200 billion over 10 years beyond fiscal feasibility supporters of mr bush argue that a big tax cut is needed to spur an economy that they say may be flirting with recession this argument too is weak tax policy is rarely used to offset the ups and downs of a modern economy because it is too hard to time the impact of a tax cut congress would probably not pass a major tax cut bill until the fall and consumers would likely not respond for many months thereafter it could be well more than a year before any significant increase in consumer spending kicked in and by that time the economic slowdown the tax cut sought to reverse might already be long past most economists look to monetary policy which can be changed rapidly and often by the federal reserve to keep the economy on an even keel the bush plan is the wrong economic elixir but a smaller targeted tax cut could indeed make sense rather than awarding the bulk of tax cuts to the wealthy as the bush plan would do the better idea is to focus tax cuts on low income families those whose earnings have slipped during most of the last 30 years congress could provide a tax credit to offset the cost of health insurance for example it could use tax credits to offset the impact of payroll taxes which hit poor families proportionately harder than wealthy families modest tax cuts targeted in this way would make a fine use of any unclaimed federal revenues
