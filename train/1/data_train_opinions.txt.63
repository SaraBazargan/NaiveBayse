 by the ordinary logic of politics the vice president of an administration that has given us the greatest prosperity in history should be way ahead in this election that he is not is a tribute to the campaigning skill of george w bush no one can doubt any longer that mr bush is a formidable candidate one key to his success became clear in the three debates with al gore all politicians bob and weave around issues that are difficult for them governor bush is a master of the technique when they were debating a patients bill of rights for example and governor bush was asked the difference between the candidates he answered well the difference is that i can get it done that ducked the real issue of what the it was what such legislation should include and obscured the fact that he did not support the meaningful bill pending in congress he repeatedly argued that he could make things happen by putting partisanship aside saying that the clinton administration had had eight years and not achieved a patients bill of rights and other things with that rhetorical device he blanked out the rabid republican partisanship that has made congress a graveyard of legislation and judicial nominations over recent years asked whether he would support a law barring job discrimination against gays and lesbians governor bush replied i do n't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation that is no doubt true admirable and irrelevant to the question of legislation as to that he said gays and lesbians should not have special rights code words used by those who oppose equal rights legislation his reason for avoiding questions of that kind is plain governor bush 's slogan is that he is a compassionate conservative so he does not want to look unsympathetic to people who face discrimination or who are treated unfairly by medical insurance companies but he also does not want to offend the christian right or the insurance companies another facet of governor bush became evident in the debates once he has taken a position designed to fend off criticism he sticks to it no matter how thoroughly it has been exploded long before the debates he sought to stake out a distinct position on foreign and security policy by saying that the us had troops in too many places around the world i believe we 're overextended in too many places he said in the first debate in the second debate asked from which missions he would withdraw the only thing he came up with was that we should convince our european friends to put troops on the ground in the balkans he was apparently unaware that the europeans already have troops there more than we do there are about 10000 americans in a total of 66000 peacekeepers in the third debate he said again i 'm concerned that we 're over deployed around the world undaunted by the facts the reality that he would not bring home our large forces in japan korea or the nato countries he stuck with a line that he thought sounded good another example of that dogged avoidance of reality is capital punishment in the second debate he answered a question about hate crimes by saying with seeming pleasure that three texas killers of a black man were going to be put to death actually only two had been sentenced to death a questioner in the third debate said governor bush seemed to overly enjoy the fact that texas led the nation in executions mr bush said his job in the execution process was to ask two questions sir is the person guilty of the crime and did the person have full access to the courts of law and i can tell you looking at you right now in all cases those questions were answered in the affirmative that is the position that governor bush has consistently taken it just happens to be untrue the way texas provides lawyers for capital defendants is notoriously unfair people have been convicted and sentenced to death after trials in which their lawyers were drunk or asleep and the courts of texas have found no error in that outrage when faced in the debates with particular facts about problems like social security or taxes governor bush scorned them as washington fuzzy math but he is the master of fuzzy rhetoric
