 to the editor re legislators approve web list disclosing missteps by doctors front page june 24 keeping tabs on doctors competence is reasonable but publicizing their malpractice records may not be in the public 's interest as it is many doctors order more tests and consultations than are necessary actions that greatly increase the cost of health care to deter the notoriety of a malpractice suit thus it is possible that making their records public will encourage them to practice even more defensively thereby subjecting patients to unnecessary and potentially dangerous medical treatments and procedures it makes more sense to have a federal agency working through state medical societies oversee doctors competence and enforce remedial education when necessary edward j volpintesta md bethel conn june 24 2000
