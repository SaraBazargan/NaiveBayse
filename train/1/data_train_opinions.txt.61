 to the editor the videos produced by the united states to improve our image in the muslim world front page oct 30 are off the point muslim hostility toward us has little to do with how muslims fare in american society these feel good videos wo n't change any minds because the anger from the muslim street seems to derive from our support of the tyrannical governments that rule their countries our position in the israeli palestinian conflict the presence of american soldiers on their soil and a generalized feeling of longtime perceived injustices and slights more encouraging is that muslim academics are being sent to study in the united states and that a radio station in muslim countries will broadcast the american perspective on world events janice gewirtz mountain lakes nj oct 30 2002
