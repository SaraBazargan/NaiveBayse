 the editorial board of the new york times has the same problem i do the candidate whose domestic policy we favor is not the one with the worldview we prefer what troubles the times about al gore 's tough minded weltanschauung is just what draws me to the democrat with perverse consistency what appeals to the times about george bush 's reluctance to intervene worries me about the republican take the balkans as henny youngman would have added please gore frowned the times yesterday argued for a more muscular projection of american influence including military intervention in overseas trouble spots he described himself as a 'hard liner in favor of action during debates over the balkans as the house hawk i see that as the vice president 's finest hour mr gore in trying to draw distinctions between himself and the less experienced governor continued my distressed confreres about the second debate outlined a more aggressive response to america 's role as the sole superpower though crediting him for being on the right track for trying to deal with genocidal conflict the times complained that he offered no assurances on what limits he might place on such involvements defining such limits is the essence of presidential leadership that 's what i like most about gore he confidently asserts his assumption of superpower responsibility he offers no self defeating promises about exit strategies and makes no apologies for taking action to save lives protect human values and turn back totalitarians marshaling public support for needed sacrifice is in my book the job of a leader and what of george w whose tax plan decentralization approach and retirement reforms i embrace as a page that has generally been reluctant to endorse military intervention says the editorial of the newspaper i revere especially for inventing the op ed page we like mr bush 's cautious attitude it likes his position that any foreign involvement must be based on a strict definition of vital national interest those qualifiers strict and vital strike me as words used often to excuse or justify inaction bush 's most impressive moment in the campaign came when he parted company from impatient republicans in congress who using such severe sounding weasel words wanted to exit strategize our troops out of the balkans before our intervention helped the serbian people free themselves it 's undeniable though that bush whose foreign experience is second hand is using the language of caution this is designed to persuade voters that his inexperience would not lead him to reckless action bush 's rhetoric of restraint is supposed to insulate him from the charges of that damned cowboy leveled first by mark hanna against teddy roosevelt and by others at ronald reagan he knows that humility in hegemony becomes a leader of a superpower respect for local opinion beats arrogance and bombast but in the face of genocide as in the balkans or against germ warheads on missiles from iraq a president should construe vital interest not strictly but broadly like recklessness misplaced caution can cost a lot of lives having pushed the presidential campaign aside in the headlines the worry of war will intrude itself into tomorrow 's debate suddenly we are made to realize that it 's the world stupid that we are to choose not only among rival prescription drug entitlements but also between differing approaches to the use of force should clinton his diplomacy too soon made glad junket to north korea for a legacy photo op should we expand nato to include democratic baltic nations vulnerable to putin 's russia should we affirm our tilt toward israel now that our broker posture is treated with arab contempt were general intelligence warnings that spooked the white house into acquiescing in the un excoriation of israel not transmitted to our naval vessel in yemen awakened voters want to know when do national interests become vital what action would you take to defend them does a defense against missiles now seem more urgent on this i 'm rooting for bush to be more like gore unless of course gore tries to be more like bush
