 this afternoon millions of people who never pay any attention to horse racing will be likely to flip on their television sets to watch the belmont stakes war emblem a horse with a difficult personality and legs full of bone chips is trying for the triple crown if he wins he will become one of racing 's immortals right up there with secretariat and affirmed and seattle slew if he loses he will be consigned to the ranks of canonero ii real quiet and silver charm who all won the derby and the preakness but failed to make it in new york the triple crown is one of those achievements like the home run record that hold a fascination for people who do not normally pay any attention to sports only 11 horses have won it in the century and a quarter that the three races have been run if you have reached middle age and have a single vision of a horse race it is more likely than not of secretariat drawing away in the belmont by 31 lengths breaking the track record winning the triple crown and fixing himself in popular memory as the archetypal thoroughbred asking a three year old horse still a kid really to run a mile and a half race is a bit silly even older horses seldom run that far and to do it after two other hard contests over a five week period is really an invitation to disaster it would make no sense to press a valuable animal that hard if the public had not decided for some reason that this was the ultimate achievement in racing affirmed was the last triple crown winner in 1978 since then eight horses have won the kentucky derby and preakness but because the seven preceding war emblem failed in the belmont they are now remembered only by people who are actually interested in horse racing during some period other than a three race campaign in the late spring war emblem is not a sentimental favorite he is owned by a saudi prince who bought him three weeks before the derby for 900000 it is not the sort of story that 's likely to have people lining up to commission a movie about his life but if he wins we will get over it very few thoroughbreds of this caliber are owned by humble folk who just happen to love horses or small boys who raise them to stardom on the family farm if you are good enough at your job your performance transcends small matters of personality background and history you are what you did and if war emblem can pull it off decades from now people who go years without seeing a horse race will still remember his name
