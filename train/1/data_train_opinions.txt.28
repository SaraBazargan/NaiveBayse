 accountants are trained to make complicated corporate situations neat and easily comprehensible and that is just what representatives of arthur andersen tried to do at yesterday 's congressional hearings into the destruction of enron documents a panel of employees of the accounting giant testified that the fault for what now appears to be a truly huge document shredding project spread out over months and perhaps involving scores of workers lay entirely with a single man david duncan who has been fired as an andersen auditor dorsey baskin managing director of andersen 's professional standards group declared gravely that mr duncan the engagement partner responsible for the enron account had acted without any consultation with others in the firm or so far as we are aware with legal counsel c e andrews an andersen global managing partner also funneled the blame to mr duncan that is not andersen he said of the document destruction that is not what we encourage our employees to do nancy temple who was in charge of enron litigation for andersen appeared crestfallen that mr duncan had embarked on his document shredding spree without her knowledge i only wish she sighed that someone would have raised the question the only andersen employee who did not pick up the theme was not surprisingly mr duncan himself whose version of events remains unknown since he pleaded the fifth amendment to all the committee 's questions while the andersen team was testifying in the house a senate committee heard arthur levitt the former chairman of the securities and exchange commission repeat his calls for tougher conflict of interest rules for the accounting industry and take a swipe at reform proposals put forth by his successor harvey pitt it was the start of what promises to be a long season of enron hearings it would certainly make life easier for arthur andersen if the world accepted its story the accounting industry version of the lone gunman theory but yesterday no one on the house energy and commerce subcommittee appeared convinced as the lawyer on whose watch the document destruction occurred ms temple had the most explaining to do she was the one who sent an e mail to a top andersen executive in houston on oct 12 telling him to remind the enron team of the firm 's document retention and disposal policy was that a reminder to protect necessary papers or did it amount one congressional inquisitor asked pointedly to a shredding order just as troublesome was the timeline of events as presented by the andersen team ms temple eventually got around to telling mr duncan that all the enron documents had to be preserved but not until nov 9 more than two weeks after the sec began its inquiry into enron why the committee wanted to know did ms temple wait so long andersen insists that it was solely mr duncan 's decision whether or not to destroy documents up until november even though at that point the sec 's investigation of enron was well under way and andersen had retained a large new york law firm to help it defend against possible lawsuits with all those red flags flapping around would andersen still leave the decision about which documents to save and which to destroy entirely to mr duncan an accountant without any input from the firm 's lawyers the committee chairman billy tauzin for one was skeptical enough to warn any accounting firms that might be watching the hearings not to try to make this argument in the future another republican cliff stearns risked stating the obvious when he asked is mr duncan being made a scapegoat here this morning the ancient greeks believed that by beating a human outcast with rods and shouting out with hunger and in with health and wealth they could drive their troubles away if arthur andersen is trying to update the ritual it has gotten off to a bad start
