 to the editor an aug 24 letter writer 's comparison of the federal government and mcdonald 's is too simplistic a better comparison is the government as a landlord of an apartment building the current tax cut situation is akin to a landlord who decides to return some of the rent money to tenants but mostly wealthy ones instead of using rent money for improvements to make the building more livable for everyone with say central air conditioning if so much is returned that central air conditioning becomes unaffordable the poorer tenants suffer and the wealthy ones ca n't see what 's wrong because they can afford their own air conditioning units what happens when critical improvements that affect all tenants become unaffordable robert irie cambridge mass aug 24 2001
