 the republicans controlling congress return this week to anguish over how much more of a tax cut the nation 's wealthiest citizens have coming the leaders and president bush would be wise to focus instead on the needs of the growing army of unemployed americans a total of 26 million private sector jobs have been lost across the past two years a record for any modern presidency mr bush should be jawboning on behalf of benefits for the jobless as heartily as he now tours the land for still more relief for the affluent in lobbying for at least 550 billion more in tax reductions mr bush is deriding the few resistant senate republicans for holding out for no more than what he terms a little bitty package of 350 billion in cuts over the decade this sounds like a debate over whether to let the rich eat cake or brioche but 350 billion is the only option in play for opponents meanwhile the president firmly angles to cram in his beloved dividend tax cut congressional leaders hope to settle the tax issue by memorial day and move on to health care and appropriation debates talking about budgetary losers is deemed impolitic while people are still debating how many hundred billions to forgo via the tax cuts but it 's already clear that domestic programs are facing a 168 billion cut across 10 years in such vital areas as education homeland security veterans care and transportation house republicans have already tried to sidestep culpability by installing a legislative gimmick to automatically authorize deficit borrowing instead of standing up and voting as they were elected to do lawmakers will have the 900 billion bill added on to the current 64 trillion debt ceiling neat as an after dinner drink on the people 's credit card some lawmakers at least try to remind us of creative might have beens representative richard gephardt a democrat obviously even egregiously running for the presidency has dared to suggest another go at the issue of universal health care if nothing else we can salute his sense of irony in proposing to pay for this much needed but costly social program by flatly rolling back the bush tax cuts remember those days when governments did more than cut taxes and shrink government
