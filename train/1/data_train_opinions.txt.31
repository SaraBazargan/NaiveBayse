 the success of shows like survivor has many wondering where reality television is headed this question has recently come up with our own program confessions which takes an unfiltered look at convicted murderers and other violent felons reality television actually comes in two forms the first which might be called manufactured reality includes shows like survivor and big brother in which real people as opposed to actors are taped in contrived environments often with hollywood production techniques the second unmanufactured reality allows the camera to record real events and presents them with little editing examples include widely applauded programming like katie couric 's colonoscopy on today as well as controversial programming like dr jack kevorkian 's lethal injection of a patient on 60 minutes court tv whose purpose is to cover the full spectrum of crime and justice issues has been in the business of unmanufactured television since 1991 when it first began providing live courtroom coverage recently however we have been criticized for our new series that plays the taped confessions of convicted murderers and other violent felons the issue is whether this format contributes to the public 's understanding of its criminal justice system or whether the show simply taps an audience that has a prurient interest in violent crimes court tv is judged by its ratings but we also carefully consider the benefits and the context of each show and we believe that it is fair to reveal a part of the criminal justice system the confession that has not been seen to this degree before the show provides insights into the criminal mind and it fuels legitimate debate about issues like capital punishment and the usefulness of confessions yes the confessions of criminals are by their nature unsettling but providing an unfiltered look into this part of the criminal justice system is both logical and appropriate transparency particularly as it applies to our government is an important ingredient of democracy moreover all cases on confessions have been fully adjudicated and are part of the public record they have been provided to us by police departments and prosecutors around the country at the same time we agree that some concerns about the show are legitimate as a result we have decided to air after the show 's premiere an additional half hour discussion of the issues that it raises additionally a web site will provide in depth interpretation and analysis shows like survivor make viewers relatively comfortable because they provide a hollywood produced version of life a show like confessions is more troubling because in fact it provides a true picture of the world in which we live the real world is both good and bad and there is value in seeing both henry schleiff is chairman and chief executive officer of court tv
