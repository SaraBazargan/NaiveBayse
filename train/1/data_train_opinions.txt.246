 the supreme court brought relief to newsrooms across the country yesterday when it handed down an important first amendment decision in favor of freedom of the press the 6 to 3 ruling came in a tricky case that required the justices to weigh legitimate personal privacy concerns as addressed by an excessively broad federal wiretap law against the public 's right to know the case involved a tape recording of an illegally intercepted cell phone conversation between two teachers union officials the officials were discussing heated contract negotiations and there was a reference to blowing up the front porches of school board members the tape whose source is unknown made its way to local radio stations and newspapers which broadcast and published its contents there was no dispute that the tape was lawfully obtained by the media and that its contents were of public significance but its dissemination ran afoul of a 1968 wiretap law that prohibits the disclosure of illegally intercepted communications the union officials then sued but the court correctly saw that holding the press liable in this instance for the illegal conduct of its sources would have established a dangerous precedent and exercised a chilling effect on the media 's ability to report truthfully on significant matters of public concern a stranger 's illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the first amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern concluded justice john paul stevens while acknowledging the harm to people illegally taped however as it has in the past the court declined to bar all restrictions on publishing truthful information in addition a concurring opinion written by justice stephen breyer and joined by justice sandra day o'connor warned that privacy protections will generally prevail when illegally intercepted information passed on to a paper or broadcaster is purely personal and lacks high interest and importance to the public this cautionary language while potentially worrisome does not diminish the value of the decision faced with a choice between privacy claims and the media 's right to disseminate legally obtained information on matters of public importance the court sided with freedom of the press
