 to the editor re where manners still matter op ed july 15 by george b pyle the woman who admonished mr pyle by saying i remember a day when a gentleman would never wear his hat inside a building was mistaken but he should have removed it anyway as a collector of vintage clothing i have researched this question until the 1960 's nearly every man wore a hat outdoors and was entitled to leave it on indoors in public places like hotel lobbies and train stations in a restaurant a man could wear his hat while standing and waiting for a table that is in the public area but even the most informal coffee shop would have provided a hook or rack if not a checkroom for it so he was expected to remove it upon taking a seat like mr pyle i enjoy wearing a panama hat but i place it on an empty chair while i 'm eating hal glatzer new york july 15 2000
