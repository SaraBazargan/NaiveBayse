 to the editor re judicial nominee advances amid dispute over religion news article july 24 republicans assert that the democrats are trying to exclude anyone who is a good catholic from serving on the federal bench because good catholics like william pryor jr oppose abortion the objection to mr pryor the alabama attorney general who has been nominated to a federal appeals court is that in a number of cases he seems to place another set of beliefs above the united states constitution in making his decisions the source of that set of beliefs is not the issue the suggestion that good catholics would want to infuse their judicial decisions with the teachings of their church is frighteningly reminiscent of the accusations in 1960 that john f kennedy would take his direction from the vatican not the electorate or the constitution the republicans argument is profoundly anti catholic bob halstead farmington hills mich july 24 2003
