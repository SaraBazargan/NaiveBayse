 to the editor re ashcroft limiting prosecutors use of plea bargains front page sept 23 attorney general john ashcroft 's directive to federal prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges in nearly all cases and to avoid using negotiated pleas is another example of his simplistic approach to justice which overlooks the individual nature of criminal cases and their legal circumstances as experienced prosecutors know all too well treating all offenders as if their criminal acts and the roles they played in the crime were identical can be counterproductive someone should remind the attorney general that overcharging cases in which the prosecutorial evidence for a variety of reasons may be less than firm is not only inappropriate but may also be unjust even more telling it often enables guilty offenders to escape conviction because it offends jurors notion of justice cy shain san francisco sept 23 2003
